Storage,How to Get More Storage Space,"Overview
Disk space is online storage space. Stanford students, faculty, and staff are provided a variety of online storage options for their computer files. The information below gives you a quick description of AFS disk space and research disk space. There are links to the details on each of these storage systems.
Files are stored in AFS (Andrew File System). In AFS, your storage space works like the hard disk in your Mac or PC. You can store your computer files on AFS storage space but, instead of being inside your desktop computer, the files are stored in large computers (servers) across campus. There are many servers that effectively create one large storage system shared by thousands of users. You don't have to be sitting at your Mac or PC to access your AFS disk space; you can access it from almost any computer.
AFS disk space
All users with a full service SUNet ID get 5 GB of AFS disk space for storing web pages, text files, computer programs, and other forms of electronic information. This space is also referred to as ""disk quota"" or sometimes just ""quota."" This space can fill up fast depending on how you use it. It's important to monitor your disk space.
Personal AFS disk space
To check your personal AFS quota at the same time, log into a shared Stanford UNIX workstation and, at the command prompt, type:
check-stanford-afs-quota
Certain types of academic coursework requires extra disk space. Course instructors determine if an increase in disk quote is warranted. If you are granted a quota increase, when you finish the course your quota will drop to its previous level. These changes in disk space are reflected in your quota summary when you check quota online.
Students doing academic research projects can also be sponsored for more disk quota by the researcher or instructor for whom they're doing the work. If you feel that you qualify for more disk quota, you can fill out an AFS Space Request form.
To request more personal AFS disk space for other reasons, use the AFS Space Request form.
Group/Department disk space
AFS file space can be requested for groups that want a common place to store shared files. The guide lines for requesting group space is described on the  Group Request page. The form for requesting group AFS space is at the bottom of the page.
To check your group or department AFS quota, log into a shared computer with AFS installed and use the command ""fs listquota"" command.  For example:
 fs listquota /afs/ir/group/somegroup 
To request more group or department AFS disk space submit a Help request detailing how much additional space you need and why you need it.
Research disk space
Researchers often have large data sets that must be stored.  Researchers with large storage needs can obtain extra disk space from University IT.  This space is not part of the main AFS system, but it is also easily accessed.  It is only available to Stanford faculty or students doing academic or non-sponsored research.  As you might imagine, this disk space is very popular, so be sure to request and reserve it before it is required.  To learn more, go to the Research Disk Space Request page.
 If you need large amounts of disk space for academic or unsponsored research, use the Research Disk Space Request form. 
Cleaning out your disk space
The time will come when you must clean out files you don't need now, but may need later.  For most people, this happens when they're about to leave Stanford.  There is no need to print out email or other documents.  The Information for Graduating Students  page has details on how to disconnect services and archive/store email and other files."
Storage,How To Make Box Drive Work Better for You (Stanford Medicine Box),"Purpose: This Knowledge Base article sets forth some optional best practices for assisting SoM customers who have their computer hard drive reaching its maximum capacity and wish to take advantage of Stanford Medicine Box (Box Drive).
Applicability: All Stanford Medicine TDS Field Support technicians and the Stanford Medicine Tech Bars. TDS Service Desk Consultants may also provide this information to customers who feel savvy enough to undertake the remedial action on their own.
Scenario: If a users hard drive is full or nearly full, here are some best practices about using and managing Stanford Medicine Box (SM Box) with Box Drive and aliases (shortcuts) to safely reduce the utilization on the local hard drive:

1. When you open Box Drive, there are only two folders you need to worry about. Other folders are ones that other users have shared with you. ""<Your Name>’s Files"" folder (contents can only be shared with others who have their SoM computers encrypted) and ""<Your Name>’s Externally Sharable Files"" folder (contents can be shared with any other Box user in the world). There must be no High-Risk data in the Externally Sharable folder or sub-folders. SM Box will catch these files and ask you to correct their location by moving them into your ""<Your Name>’s Files"" folder.
2. MOVE your least-frequently used folders to Box Drive. You can easily find and open them by double-clicking on the Box icon in your Applications folder or in your dock, then open ""<Your Name>’s Files"" folder or the ""<Your Name>’s Externally Sharable Files"" folder.
a. In Windows, Click+Shift+drag, and release = MOVE FOLDER/FILE to the new destination. Click+Control+drag will force a COPY between local folders on the same drive.
b. In Mac, drag, and drop to Box Drive results in a MOVE. In Mac, Click+Option+drag will force a COPY between local folders on the same drive as well as to BoxDrive folders. As always, you can right-click on the file/folder and select Copy and then go to the destination and right-click in the destination folder and select Paste.
You can hold the Control key to select multiple files with the cursor and then drag them as above.
3. MOVE your most-frequently-used folders from your local Mac (on Desktop, Documents, etc.) to Box Drive, and then create desktop aliases (shortcuts) to them. Take time to determine which folders you access most frequently during a typical week. 
(In Mac) Click+Command+Option+drag and release = CREATE ALIAS OF FOLDER/FILE in the new destination.
(In Windows) Click+Control+Shift+drag and release = CREATE SHORTCUT OF FOLDER/FILE in the new destination. When you click on the alias (shortcut), you can open the folder quickly, just as if it were on your desktop.

4. Make aliases (shortcuts) of Box Drive folders within your Documents Folder, Downloads Folder, or other folders so that you can quickly move old, less frequently used documents into Box Drive on the fly.
For example, I have a folder in BoxDrive named ""Box-Documents."" I made an alias of that folder within my Documents folder on my Mac. Then, I can Click+Shift+drag (in Mac, just drag-and-drop) files/folders and drag them to the alias to quickly MOVE them into Box Drive. That trims down the size of my Documents folder to the essential ones that I work with the most. Next, you must decide whether to move some or all of the files/folders up into Box Drive. Some folders HAVE to be in the Documents folder in order to have a related application (such as Outlook) work properly.
NOTES: Box Dive will cache up to 25%—remembers which files you use frequently—to allow for quick opening. Infrequently used files will take slightly longer to open. The web version of SM Box (https://stanfordmed.box.com) keeps versions of documents that are modified/updated which you can recover in case something gets overwritten accidentally. Click the version box icon  to the right of the file name to disclose the versions.

Storage,Frequently Asked Questions about Wasabi,"These questions provide information about the Wasabi Cloud Storage service offered by UIT.What is Wasabi?
	Wasabi is a popular cloud object storage service. It’s designed to be 100% compatible and interoperable with the Simple Storage Service (S3) available from Amazon Web Services (AWS). Consider Wasabi as a drop-in replacement for S3 when designing cloud-based solutions.
	What are the benefits of Wasabi over alternatives?
	
		Lower and more predictable costs

		Using cloud object storage from Amazon, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure results in charges for transactions with your data. Common and necessary operations, including transitioning between storage tiers, retrieving data, restoring files, and deleting data ""early"" resulting in penalties, make it challenging to predict your monthly costs. Cloud vendors’ calculators are frustrating to use, and misjudgments can be expensive.

		Wasabi charges for only two activities: the month-to-month storage of data and early object deletion before 30 days. You are not charged:
		data ingress or egress feesAPI operational or transaction fee (e.g., for using GET, PUT, or transitions)tiering (i.e., there is only one tier of storage — hot storage)early object deletion after 30 days (reduced from 90 or even 365 days used by other cloud storage services)

	As a result, Wasabi is substantially less expensive than comparable alternatives.

	
		Network performance and high availability

		Stanford uses their West Coast (Oregon) data centers, which provide 99.999999999% object durability.
		
		Security and compliance

		Like other Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers, Wasabi employs a shared-responsibility model for comprehensive data security and privacy. They maintain the infrastructure, provide automatic encryption of all storage at rest and require TLS when transmitting over a network. Wasabi maintains data centers that are highly secure, fully redundant, and certified for SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance. They also meet the infrastructure requirements for various compliance regimes, including HIPAA, HITECH, and FERPA.

		The shared-responsibility model imposes data protection measures on the users of these services. The university’s Minimum Security Standards outline these actions and apply to everyone in the Stanford community. Enabling encryption of data prior to leaving the source helps protect Moderate and High Risk data from unauthorized access. Stanford Single Sign-On (Shibboleth) with two-factor authentication is a feature when accessing the Wasabi web console.
		
		Reduced data retrieval delays

		Wasabi offers only hot storage, without the lengthy retrieval times usually associated with cold or archive storage tiers.
		
		Versioning and immutability

		Options for versioning and immutability are available.
		

	NOTE: The service does not include support for backups or data transfers, but UIT provides a free consultation to help match clients with professional technology service providers on campus.
	What are some examples of ways I might use Wasabi?
	
		Backup and recovery target destination

		One of the most common uses for cloud object storage is to be the target destination for commercial backup and recovery software, like MSP360 (formerly CloudBerry Backup), CommVault, Cohesity, and Veeam. Popular free and open source backup and recovery software like BorgBackup, restic, duplicati, and Bacula works with Wasabi, too.
		
		Serve and store digital content

		Wasabi can be integrated with your existing AWS EC2 virtual machines, too, just like native S3 storage. Digital assets like images and files can be hosted in Wasabi but served by your Amazon virtual machine. Compute services in Amazon can input and output data in Wasabi, too.
		
		Cloud-based Elastic File Service

		Enterprise services like ObjectiveFS can use Wasabi as a POSIX-compatible hierarchical file system with cloud object storage backend for use with AWS, Google Cloud Platform or on-premise compute clusters. Non-technical users can also use software like Mountain Duck or ExpandDrive to present an infinitely expandable virtual hard drive on their laptop, with caching, high-performance synchronization and offline access to frequently used files. Users can simply drag and drop their files to the virtual disk’s folders like a traditional file server.
		
	What tools are compatible with Wasabi?Nearly any service or tool that can interact with AWS S3 can also interact with Wasabi. This includes the free aws-cli and gcloud command-line tools from Amazon and Google, respectively.
	
	Wasabi provides a free cloud storage browsing tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) available free of charge. Open source projects like Cyberduck and Mountain Duck provide a polished experience when browsing, synchronizing and transferring data. Backup software like restic and MSP360 also are compatible with Wasabi.

	The vendor maintains a database of certified tools and software that’s been evaluated to work without issue.
	Who can use Stanford’s Wasabi service?The Wasabi storage service is available to individuals and units with a full-service SUNet ID and a Stanford billing account. It’s available for all data risk classifications, provided its use meets Stanford's Minimum Security Standards.
	
	The service does not include support for backups or data transfers, but UIT provides a free consultation to help match clients with professional technology service providers on campus.
	What does Stanford's Wasabi service cost?Stanford has negotiated a discount with Wasabi, along with more favorable terms and a Business Associate Agreement. To take advantage of these benefits, you must request Wasabi storage through UIT. Use the Request Wasabi Cloud Storage form.
	
	One hundred percent of the discount is passed through to subscribers. The cost is what Wasabi charges Stanford with no markup. Additionally, UIT charges a flat $5 per subscriber, per month, to recover the cost of administration, irrespective of the amount of data stored.
	 

	The Stanford rate for Wasabi $5.70 per terabyte, per month (minimum 1TB). Additionally, each subscriber is charged $5 per month (regardless of service utilization) fee to recover Stanford's billing and service administration expenses.
	How does UIT bill you for the Wasabi service?UIT receives billing data from Wasabi every 30 days and passes along each subscriber's cost for their individual use. Additionally, each subscriber is charged $5 per month (regardless of service use) to recover billing and administration expenses. Your Stanford account is billed monthly.How does Wasabi bill UIT?Wasabi calculates storage charges for each gigabyte, each day. They also calculate the same price per gigabyte for the whole month, if that gigabyte of data is deleted before 30-day minimum retention has passed. Wasabi uses base-2 to define gigabytes and terabytes for storage calculation.
	
	Wasabi’s billing period is 30 days.How do I sign up for the Stanford Wasabi service?To get started with Stanford Wasabi, complete the Request Wasabi Cloud Storage form."

The ID Card Office will no longer issue Stanford ID cards with a magnetic stripe, or magstripe, on the back effective 9/1/2022.
Stanford ID cards with magstripes will continue to work with the magstripe card readers operated by University IT (UIT) Campus Card Services and found at many campus buildings, dining halls, and cafes. 
Departments and groups that use readers not supported by UIT can contact Card Services Director Jay Kohn (jkohn@stanford.edu) to work on an alternative solution for their location.
The option to print a preferred name is only available for new ID cards. If you already have an ID card but want it reprinted with your preferred name, you may update the information in the university data systems and then submit a request starting Oct. 1, 2023. The cost for a reprinted card is $25. To learn more, refer to the UIT news article: Preferred Names May Be Used on Stanford ID Cards.

The Stanford ID Card Office oversees the production of new and replacement cards, maintains a card information database of students, faculty and staff; installs and maintains card readers; and assists in developing new Stanford ID Card applications.

Eligibility for a Stanford ID Card
ID card eligibility is established by Administrative Guide Memo 2.4.3. You will find a summary of the types of cards, the eligibility criteria, and the privileges granted by each card type. A summary chart of privileges may be viewed here. ID cards may only be used by the person they are issued to.
Obtaining a Stanford ID Card
If you are a new undergraduate student, you can submit your photo online via the Approaching Stanford Forms.
New graduate students should upload their photo via the Photo Upload webpage.
Your identification card will be printed using the name in Stanford's official student or employment records UNLESS you are not commonly known by your full legal name and have indicated a preferred name in your directory listing, StanfordYou for Faculty/Staff, and Axess for Students.
If you have entered a preferred name in your directory listing, your ID card will be printed with your preferred name exactly as you have entered it in StanfordYou or Axess. If you would like to have your preferred name printed on your ID card, follow these instructions to change your preferred name.
You must show a government ID that verifies your legal name, even if a preferred name will be used for your ID card.
If you are a new employees eligible for an ID card, call 498-CARD (8-2273) first to make sure your personnel information is available (to ensure that all personnel information has been processed and a Stanford ID number assigned).
Change of status with the university
Students
Student ID cards are deactivated when you fail to enroll for any quarter other than summer quarter, or if you graduate. If you re-enroll at a later date, you can reactivate your card at the ID Card Office.
Staff, visiting scholars, and fellows
When your employment status changes to one which is no longer entitled to campus privileges, your card will not grant you access to university facilities and services. Your manager or HR officer collects your cards when your employment at Stanford ends, and must be surrendered to an appropriate university employee upon request.
Change of name
The name on your identification card must match the name in Stanford's official student or employment records or the name you have listed in your preferred name field. If your legal name changes, you must change your name in the official University records before you request a new ID card. Students can request this name change through the Student Services Center. Faculty and staff should request a name change through the Human Resources administrator. All replacement cards are $25 payable by Visa, Mastercard, and Discover.

University IT oversees all aspects of the Stanford ID Card and the Campus Card system, including developing new card services and deploying of new equipment for academic and administrative departments on campus.
The process of adding a card reader or point-of-sale terminal/reader involves the following five phases: 1) Specification, 2) Proposal, 3) Implementation, 4) Training, and 5) Support.
Specification
University IT will meet with department representatives interested in adding card services, determine their needs, and tour their facilities. Once a preliminary project scope is agreed upon, the Project Manager will consult University IT's Installation and Maintenance department, and, depending upon project scope, may also consult outside contractors including locksmiths, carpenters, electricians, etc.
Proposal
University IT will initiate an order to develop a detailed proposal including project scope, timelines, and costs. Upon acceptance by the department, a Support Level Agreement (SLA) will be presented which specifies all services and associated costs, including installation, ongoing support, training and maintenance.
Implementation
Once an SLA has been executed, University IT will place equipment orders, finalize an installation schedule, and oversee construction and installation of hardware including point-of-sale terminals, card swipers, door hardware and modifications, network connections, and data servers. University IT will also oversee installation of Campus Card System software, if appropriate, including any necessary system modifications.
Training
When all hardware, software, and construction is complete, University IT will perform a system walkthrough and will arrange initial training for department staff. When training is complete, University IT will turn the system over to the department.
Support
After University IT turns the system over to the department, the Stanford Card Office will provide support and other ongoing services including:
technical and user supportcentral Campus Card system data backupcentral Campus Card system monitoring, maintenance and administrationcentral Campus Card system software upgradessystem performance reviews, capacity planning, and change managementpreventative maintenancechanges and upgrades to department hardware/software, performed at the existing University IT service rates, andtraining of new/additional staff, performed at the existing University IT service rates.
Costs
A monthly charge is assessed on each installed card system device including door readers, entitlement readers, and point-of-sale devices, and for each network connection. New device connection, consultation to develop new applications, set-up of new schedules and privileges or changes to profiles, and additional training will be billed at existing University IT rates.
Fees are billed monthly, and will appear on your department's monthly University IT statement.
To learn more
To get started adding a card reader or point-of-sale terminal, or to learn more about Campus Card services, contact the Stanford IT Service Desk (650) 725-HELP (5-4357) or submit a Help ticket."
ID Card & Door Access,How do I set privacy settings for my Stanford ID card image?,"Your Stanford ID card image is the picture printed on your Stanford ID card. The image can only be viewed by authorized users of the university’s access and transaction systems, unless you change the privacy setting.
To change the visibility settings of the image via StanfordYou:
Log into StanfordYou.
Note: Students cannot change their image visibility settings in StanfordYou. If you are a student, use the Privacy function of Stanford Axess to change the visibility settings of your Stanford ID card image.
Click Maintain your directory and AlertSU emergency contact information.Click change visibility, next to Image.Select Private, Stanford, or Public, in the Image visibility dropdown list.
Private - Your Stanford ID card image will remain private and can only be seen by you and authorized users of the university access and transaction systems.Stanford - Where the image appears on Stanford websites, only people authenticated by a SUNet ID can view the image.Public - Where the image appears on Stanford websites, anyone viewing the web page can view the image.
Click Save.
Image usage
Photos taken for and included on the Stanford ID card do not automatically appear on any university websites, in any applications or in any printed materials.
However, starting April 29, 2020, Stanford faculty and staff ID card photos are included in StanfordWho, the university's online directory, when the visibility setting is changed from Private to Stanford or Public. This includes photos taken for the ID card and photos that have been uploaded to the ID card website. 
Note: You may opt to have the image that appears in StanfordWho populated by the image you uploaded in Stanford Profiles, a virtual workspace designed to support collaboration among faculty, graduate students, and postdocs. To do this, ensure the visibility setting for your ID card image is set to Private. 
In addition, approval by university human resources, staff and faculty photos may be included on specified websites, applications or as part of printed materials. Even with this approval from human resources, your photo will only appear if you have changed the visibility setting from Private to Stanford or Public."

Research Computing,"Windows SSH reports ""message authentication code incorrect""","What is the problem?
Using the SSH client on Windows 11, when you try connecting to some SSH servers, you might get an error that includes these messages:

Corrupted MAC on input.
message authentication code incorrect

Here is an example of the problem (the example uses the Command Prompt, but the problem also happens when using PowerShell):

This is due to a bug in Microsoft's build of the SSH client for Windows.
How do I fix it?
Until Windows provides an updated SSH client that fixes this problem, you can work around the issue by telling SSH to avoid the problematic code.
To install the workaround, you will need to create a file in the .ssh directory, in your Windows home directory.
To start, open a File Explorer window, starting at your Home:

Next, in the address bar, type %HOMEPATH% and press Enter:

Next, in your home folder, you should see a folder named .ssh.  If the .ssh folder does not exist, create it.  Go in to your .ssh folder.

Next, in the .ssh folder, create a new Text Document named config.txt.

Next, open config.txt, and copy/paste the following text:
Host *  # Disable the umac-128-etm@openssh.com MAC.  # LibreSSH (used by OpenSSH for Windows) has a bug in its implementation of  # UMAC-128-ETM, which causes connections to fail with the error  # ""message authentication code incorrect"".  # Source: https://github.com/libressl/portable/issues/603  # and HelpSU KB00019944.  MACs -umac-128-etm@openssh.com
It should look like this:

Save and close the file.
Finally, change the file's name from config.txt to config.  You will be asked if you are sure about changing the file extension; click ""Yes"".

Try your SSH connection again; it should work now."
Project Management Tools,Converting a RIDAC in Project Portfolio Management,"Risks, Issues, Decisions, Actions, and Changes (RIDAC) can all be tracked individually. However, during the project lifecycle, one RIDAC might convert to another type (e.g., a risk might turn into an issue and an issue might turn into a request for change.)
See the diagram below for the RIDAC flow:

Converting a RIDAC to another RIDAC type
Go to the related list for the item you want to convert (Risk, Issue, Decision, Action).Click the ‘Short description’ or ‘Number’ for the item you want to convert.Scroll down to ‘Related Links’ and click ‘Convert to RIDAC’.
On the conversion screen:
Select task type.Note: The selections will vary depending on the type of RIDAC you are converting (e.g., an issue cannot be converted to a risk, and a decision cannot be converted to an issue) [see the process diagram above].If needed, update the Short description.Add an Assigned to.Select ‘Close [Risk, Issue, Decision, Action]’.Click ‘OK’.This will change the RIDAC State to ‘Closed Complete’ and create the new RIDAC record, indicated in the blue bar at the top of the screen.Click the number in the blue bar at the top of the screen to update the new record."
Project Management Tools,Project Portfolio Management - Project Record Overview,"To explore a project record, click the project number to enter the project record.
At the top of the project record, chevrons indicate the project's phase. When you are first assigned to the project, there will be a blue line under ""Initiate."" A checkmark will appear next to each completed phase as you update the project phases. You can update the phase using the Phase dropdown below.

Below the project phases, you'll see the main project information.
If the project is created from a demand, the Project Name will be copied from the Demand.
The Business unit will also have copied from the Demand, and if you create a new project, this field will default to your business unit.
Anyone in your business unit's project manager group can be assigned as a Project manager. The project manager will update all the information related to this project record.
Throughout the execution phase of the project, you will update the Status, or health of the project, before creating a status report. Updating the Status is critical because it appears on the project within your business unit's Projects Dashboard.
The Phase field should be updated as you move from one project phase to the next.
The Project number is the ServiceNow assigned project reference ID.
You can update a project's Percent complete manually, or if you are using project tasks, it will update automatically based on the completion of each task.
The State field differs from the project phase. State notes if a project is pending, open, a work in progress, or closed. The state selections are universal in the ServiceNow system and cannot be modified.
The State of a project is determined by the current project phase:
Initiation and planning phase: ""Open.""Execution phase: ""Work in Progress""Complete: ""Closed Complete""
Note: Cancelled project states can be ""Closed Incomplete"" or ""Closed Skipped.""


The Description field will default to ""Description/Business Case"" when it is created in a demand. However, it can be modified. 
If the project is created from a demand, the name will appear in the read-only Demand field.
Dates tab
The dates tab includes the project's Planned start date and Planned end date. If the project is created from a demand, the planned start and end dates will copy from the Demand. You can update these dates manually, or if you use project tasks to track the schedule, the planned start and end dates will become read-only and automatically calculate from the scheduled project tasks.
Planned duration will automatically be calculated based on the project start and end dates.
Planned effort is the projected amount of time spent on the planned tasks.
Actual start date, Actual end date, and Actual duration are automatically calculated based on the actual length of time spent on planned tasks.
Actual effort is automatically calculated by actual time spent on project tasks.
Planned/Actual Go-Live Date is a Stanford field to track when the expected delivery of a project will be. This may differ from the planned end date as there are often post-go-live tasks to be completed on a project.
Details tab
The details tab contains Portfolio, which will default to your business unit's portfolio, Program, and other configurable fields for your business unit, such as Project classification, Stanford entity, Sponsoring department, and Interested campus partners.
Project complexity is a Stanford field to track how complex a project is expected to be.
Depending on the type of project, you can update the Execution type to waterfall, agile, or a combination of the two: hybrid.
If a PTA is associated with the project, you can enter that information using the PTA name and PTA number fields.
If the project is created from a demand, the Project sponsors will copy over. You can click the lock icon to change or add additional project sponsors.
Project charter link, Project website link, and Project plan link are URL fields that can be used to link to additional project information.
Finally, the Status report link navigates to the most recent status report for the project.
Business Case tab
If the project started from a demand, all of the information from the Demand's business case tab will be copied over. Otherwise, this is where you can enter detailed information about the project, including Strategic area (a configurable field for your business unit), Business case, Solution overview, Staffing, project and/or post-implementation cost, Risk of performing, Risk of not performing, Constraints, In scope, Out of scope, and Assumptions. None of the fields are mandatory.
Post-Implementation Costs tab
The post-implementation costs tab has been added to track additional costs of the project once it has gone into production, including additional FTE, Professional services, Licensing, or Third-party maintenance that might be needed.
Notes tab
The notes tab will display the activity history of the project record. For example, when the project manager or the priority fields are modified, the history will appear from the most recent update to the oldest.  


Work notes are internal notes on the project or a place to converse with collaborators. Adding an @ in front of someone's name will tag them in the work notes post and notify them.
Adding someone to the Watch list will keep them updated on project activity. To do this, click the lock icon next to the Watch list, search for a user in the system, or add their email to the email address field. Then click ENTER.
Adding someone to the Work notes list will keep them updated on any work notes posted to the project. To do this, click the lock icon next to the Work notes list and search for a user in the system or add their email to the email address field and click ENTER.
Two additional sections make up the project record. These include ""Related Links"" and ""Related Lists."" We'll explore each of these sections later in the user guide."
Project Management Tools,Qualifying and Approving a Demand in Project Portfolio Management (PPM),"Once all the demand details, including resource plans, are finalized, the demand can be qualified. Once the demand has entered the qualified state there is no further action needed by the Demand Manager unless changes need to be made to the demand record.
At this stage, it is ready for PPM governance – this is the group or committee within your organization that will approve and prioritize projects.
Qualifying a Demand

Project Management Tools,Project Portfolio Management (PPM) - Project Resource Management,"There are several tasks that need to be completed before closing a project. These include:
Reviewing and completing all project resource plans.Creating a final project status report.Updating the actual end date.
Project Resource Management
Project Resource Management is the process of planning, organizing, scheduling and managing a project's resources, such as people. A resource plan is a reservation for a person’s (or group’s) time.
Project managers (PM) can create resource plans and specify the group or user resources required to complete deliverables for the project. Additionally, they verify resource availability and make changes to their resource plans before requesting resources.
Resource managers can view the requested resources' availability, existing allocations, and utilization and allocate resource plans.
Resource Plan States
 
Resource plans for a project should almost always be in a “Confirmed” or “Allocated” state. This is important because resource plans NOT in a “Confirmed” or “Allocated” state (i.e., Planning or Requested state) are not reflected in resource capacity analysis/reports.
State Description Planning or Requested
Resource plans will be in one of these states temporarily if you have:
created a new resource plan and you are communicating with the people manager to verify that the staff member has availability; ormade a copy of an existing resourcepPlan (see Copy a Resource Plan)
You can modify resource plans in these states (e.g. to increase the % FTE, change the resource Type from ‘Role” to “User”, change the plan duration, etc.).
Confirmed
All resource plans that come over from the Demand should be in a “Confirmed” state. These resource plans were vetted during the Demand process, but project managers should vet them again when beginning a project.
You can modify resource plans that are in a “Confirmed” state.Once you've made changes, you should then allocate the resource plan.
Allocated
Allocated resource plans have been verified and are ""locked in.""You cannot modify allocated resource plans. 
If you need to change an allocated resource plan, see Modify an Allocated Resource Plan for instructions."

During signup, you can choose your username (name@alumni.stanford.edu), giving you a professional, Stanford-branded email address for life.
If you set up your alumni account before the end of the 120-day grace period, new emails sent to your @stanford.edu address will forward to your @alumni.stanford.edu address for two years. We recommend using your alumni email with friends since it is a permanent address.
To learn more and sign up for an alumni email account, visit the Stanford Alumni Email Account webpage. For instructions on migrating your student @stanford.edu Gmail and data to your alumni account, see Migrate Your Student Email to Your Alumni Account and Back Up Your Student G Suite Data.
Set up email forwarding 
About four months after you graduate, Stanford automatically forwards your @stanford.edu mail to your alumni email address. The university keeps this forwarding in place for two years. However, University IT (UIT) recommends initiating the forwarding process yourself to ensure received emails are successfully transferred.
Before you start migrating your mail, forward your @stanford.edu mail to your alumni email address so you only have to migrate your mail once.

Go to Stanford Accounts.
Select the Email Management tile and then click the Forward email tile.
Follow the onscreen instructions.We recommend that you select Do NOT keep a copy stored in your @stanford.edu mailbox. 

Note: To forward your @stanford.edu email to your Gmail account, please submit a Help request.
Set an autoreply message
You can inform senders of your new email address by setting up an autoreply message. 

Go to Stanford Accounts.
Select the Email Management tile.
Click the Manage Autoreply tile. You will be redirected to your Stanford email (Microsoft 365 or Gmail) account to set up your autoreply message.

Review these step-by-step instructions if you need assistance with setting up automatic replies in Stanford email (Microsoft 365 or Gmail).



Save your stored email

If you use POP, your email is already saved on your computer; no further action is required.
If you use IMAP, be sure that your email and attachments are cached on your machine. To check this, set your email client to work offline and then make sure you can still get to all your email and attachments. If you can't see your messages and attachments offline, refer to your email program's documentation for how to change the caching setting.
If you use POP to your AFS space (mutt or Alpine), your email is stored in the /Mail folder there. Use OpenAFS to mount your home folder, then either use a desktop email client (e.g., Apple Mail or Outlook) to import the email from the /Mail folder, or just copy the files to your local computer's hard drive.
If you use Webmail, you will have to install a desktop client (e.g., Apple Mail or Thunderbird) and use POP to download all your email to your local computer's hard drive. See Configuring Your Email for instructions on how set up your email client.

Move your files from your AFS space
Use OpenAFS for Stanford to mount your home folder, and copy the files from your home folder to your hard drive. If you don't have OpenAFS installed, use an SFTP client such as SecureFX (Windows) or Fetch(Mac) to transfer the files.
Close your AFS website
If you've put a personal web site at your www.stanford.edu/~sunetid address, you may want to use the grace period to redirect people to another web site. You can do this just by placing a link to your new site on your Stanford site's home page, or by using this <head> tag:

<meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""5;URL=https://www.mynewsite.com"">
This will cause most browsers to automatically display the specified URL after a delay of 5 seconds (or any number of seconds you specify).

Your website files are stored in the /WWW folder of your AFS home folder. Use OpenAFS for Stanford to mount your home folder, and copy the files from your home folder to your hard drive. If you don't have OpenAFS installed, use an SFTP client such as SecureFX (Windows) or Fetch (Mac) to transfer the files.
If you have questions, please submit a Help ticket.
Close your Stanford Sites website
To remove your personal website at people.stanford.edu/sunetid, submit a Help ticket. You have the option of requesting an offline archive of your website.
Disconnect your in-room network connection
Remember to disconnect your in-room network connection. While it may take a day or two for your RCC to process your disconnect request, it could be processed more quickly, so we recommend that this be the last thing you do before you are ready to pack up your computer and move out."
Email,How to Migrate Your Student Microsoft 365 Email to Your Alumni Account,"These instructions are for moving student Microsoft 365 email. If you are unsure as to whether your @stanford.edu mail account is hosted in Microsoft or Google, open a browser and visit webmail.stanford.edu. Your email will display in either Microsoft Outlook or Stanford Google Mail.
To migrate your email you'll need to use a desktop email client such as Apple Mail or Microsoft Outlook.  See the Microsoft 365 Configuration Instructions for information about setting up your email client.
You'll need to configure your alumni email account for IMAP. This allows you  to migrate your mail with folders and labels intact.
Forward your @stanford.edu mail
About four months after you graduate, Stanford automatically forwards your @stanford.edu mail to your alumni email address. The university keeps this forwarding in place for two years.
Before you start migrating your mail, forward your @stanford.edu mail to your alumni email address so you only have to migrate your mail once.

Follow the onscreen instructions.We recommend that you select DO NOT keep a copy stored in your @stanford.edu mailbox.

Migrate your @stanford.edu mail
Step 1. Create a Google account password for your alumni account.
To use IMAP with an email client, you need to use a Google account password instead of your SUNet ID password. If you have not yet done so, create a Google account password for your alumni account. Use the following link  to log in to your alumni account to set your password:

Stanford Alumni Association: https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/my-account/profile/alumni-email/edit/

Notes:

Your Google account password must be different from your SUNet ID password.
If you change your Google account password during this process, be sure to change it on any mobile device previously set up to use the previous password. 

Step 2. Enable IMAP on your alumni account.
Use the following link to log in to your alumni, then enable IMAP  using instructions provided by Google.

Alumni account:

Stanford Alumni Association: https://alumni.stanford.edu/tools/mail?level=12



Step 3. Configure your desktop email client.
Alumni account: Configure your desktop email client for an IMAP connection to your alumni account. Use the following email address to configure the connection:

Alumni account email address: AlumniUsername@alumni.stanford.edu
If you see a ""Password incorrect"" error when trying to sign in with your Google account password, you may need to change your account access settings.  Go to www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and change Access for less secure apps to Turn on.

Student account: Configure your desktop email client for an Microsoft 365 connection to your Stanford account.

Student account email address: SUNetID@stanford.edu

Use the following instructions to configure the connection:

If you use a computer running macOS and use Apple Mail, launch Apple Mail and follow the Apple Mail for Microsoft 365 configuration instructions.
If you use a computer running macOS  and use Outlook, launch Outlook and follow the Outlook for Mac Microsoft 365 configuration instructions.
If you use a computer running Windows, launch Microsoft Outlook and follow the Outlook for Windows Microsoft 365 configuration instructions .

Step 4. Migrate your mail.
To migrate your mail, you need to make two concurrent connections, one to each account. Use your @stanford.edu account for the first connection and your alumni account for the second connection.
Note: Using drag and drop to migrate your mail is not recommended. You could lose your mail if an interruption occurs.
Once you have set up your connections to both of your two email accounts, use your email client's Copy function to copy mail from your Stanford account to your alumni account. If you use a different mail client than the ones referenced here, you may need to re-create your folders or labels manually.
Tip: If you have a lot of mail to migrate, try copying it in blocks of a few months or a year at a time. Do a test block of a few months . Then, increase or decrease the size of the next blocks depending on how long the test block took to copy.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to allow sufficient time for your mail migration to complete.

If you are using Apple Mail, click Window, then click Activity to ensure that all messages have migrated.
If you are using Microsoft Outlook, click Send/Receive, then click Show Progress to ensure that all messages have migrated.


Step 5. Exit your email client.
After you have completed the migration of your email from your Stanford account to your alumni account, close both connections and exit the mail client.

Email,Can I have POP access enabled so I can access by Stanford mail in my personal Gmail account?,"No. The type of authentication Gmail does for POP connections is not compatible with Office365's current security requirements.  In addition, such a setup would be incompatible with the compliance requirements for handling secure email.

Email,How Secure Email Works,"Overview
Secure Email is designed for faculty and staff who need to send Moderate or High Risk Data via email.
Any messages sent through the primary group of outgoing mail servers with the word ""Secure:"" somewhere in the Subject line of the message — it doesn't matter if it's at the beginning, middle, or end, as long as it's there somewhere — will be processed by the Secure Email service.
The service uses two different methods to insure the messages it handles are delivered securely.  The method used depends on the destination address where the message is delivered:


Mail sent to Trusted Domains 
Some internal email systems have been designated as ""Trusted Domains"" for Secure Email purposes.  Communication to and from these systems is guaranteed to be encrypted, so the messages can securely pass through to those systems like any other email message.
The following have been designated as trusted domains: stanford.edu (provided the account has not been forwarded to an external or departmental address), stanfordhealthcare.org, stanfordchildrens.org.


Mail sent to Untrusted Domains
Messages that are sent to addresses that are not a member of a trusted domain (including @stanford.edu addresses that are forwarded to external or departmental addresses) are encrypted and sent to the recipient as an attachment.  The recipient must open the message and enter the password that they created when they registered their email address with the Cisco Registered Envelope Service (CRES).





Sent From
Delivered To
Result


@stanford.edu, @stanfordhealthcare.org, @stanfordchildrens.org

The message opens normally and recipient can read it right away without having to enter another password.


@stanford.edu, @stanfordhealthcare.org, @stanfordchildrens.org

Stanford email that is forwarded — either to a department server or to an external account such as Gmail
Non-Stanford email account


The message is encrypted when it leaves the Stanford trusted domain and appears to the recipient as an email attachment. Recipients need to enter a password to access the message.



Recipient (external to Stanford) replying to or forwarding a secure message
@stanford.edu, @stanfordhealthcare.org, @stanfordchildrens.org
As long as ""Secure:"" is somewhere in the Subject line of the message, the message is sent securely.



Tips

The way for a Stanford recipient to tell whether a message was sent using the Secure Email service is to look for ""Secure:"" somewhere in the Subject line. If ""Secure:"" is in the Subject line, the email was routed through the Secure Email server.
Stanford senders should always include ""Secure:"" in the subject when sending Moderate or High Risk Data via email. Even if the original message is sent to a presumably trusted domain, the sender cannot be sure of the automatic mail-forwarding settings of the recipient. Including ""Secure:"" in the subject ensures that the message will be encrypted if the recipient's mail leaves Stanford's trusted set of domains.
You do not need to register your Stanford Email account (or that of other trusted domains such as @stanfordchildrens.org or @stanfordhealthcare.org) in order to read secure email. It arrives in your Inbox as any other message. Email sent within the Stanford email system is already encrypted.
If you believe you are receiving secure email through a Stanford Email account but the messages appear as encrypted attachments, the messages have left the Stanford Email and Calendar service. It's possible that you are receiving your Stanford email via a department server using an alternate address.(Symptom: You can see the email in webmail, but not in a desktop client.) Please contact your local IT Support for more information about your final destination address.
To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Stanford University High Risk Data, email that contains High Risk Data may only be received on Stanford mail servers. If, in your role at Stanford University, there is any chance that you might receive High Risk Data via email, please do not have your email forwarded automatically outside of the Stanford Email account system. For example, you should not forward your Stanford email to a Gmail or Yahoo email address. Take a moment to check StanfordYou to confirm your settings."

Email,Frequently Asked Questions about Modern Email Authentication,"Will I be prompted for two-step authentication every time I use my email?

You will be prompted every time you log in to your email and the first time you configure your email client or app.
How long will this change limit my email access on my laptop, desktop computer, VDI, or mobile device?
The change should take up to one hour. If your email stops working and does not start re-downloading within an hour, you should delete your mail profile from your device and reconfigure it. Configuration instructions for Windows or Mac desktop clients, iOS devices, Android devices, and Linux are available on the Microsoft 365 Configuration Instructions webpage. This varies by device. In many cases access will be limited for a few minutes or hours; in rare cases it may be limited for several days.
How might my mobile device, laptop, or desktop be affected by this change?

How the change affects you depends on how your devices are configured. To implement the change on email applications installed on your computing devices (e.g, Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird), your email configuration may need to be updated. If your email client is already configured for modern authentication, you will not notice any change when your account is updated. If you have difficulty accessing your email after the change, you will need to manually reconfigure your email. Configuration instructions are available on the Microsoft 365 Configuration Instructions webpage. If reconfiguration does not resolve the problem, please submit a Help request.
Here’s what to expect if you access your email on your mobile device, laptop, or desktop:

iOS: If your iOS device is enrolled in Stanford's Mobile Device Management (MDM) (also called AirWatch) and meets the minimum system requirements, this change should happen automatically within an hour of the time that is specified in your notification. If your iOS device is not enrolled in MDM, and you have an issue with your email after the time the change is scheduled, you may need to reconfigure your email manually.
Android: Whether or not your Android device is enrolled in MDM, if you have an issue with your email after the time that is specified in your notification, you may need to reconfigure your email manually.  
Laptops, desktops, and VDIs:

If you use Windows, in most cases this change should happen automatically within an hour of the time that is specified in your notification.
If you use macOS and you purchased your device within the last two years, in most cases this change should happen automatically within an hour of the time that is specified in the notification.
If you use Linux and you have difficulty accessing your email after the transition time that is specified in your notification, you may need to reconfigure your email manually.




I use Cardinal Key to log in. How will this affect my email during the change?
Cardinal Key has no effect on the email change.
Will this affect my email messages or calendar appointments?
No email or calendar items will be lost. While your device redownloads your information, you can access your appointments and emails online through Webmail (webmail.stanford.edu).
What Microsoft 365 features will be affected by this change?
This change affects your email and calendar, which will all be accessible online through Webmail (webmail.stanford.edu) during the change. OneDrive is not impacted.
Will I need to re-download my desktop client for Outlook?
No, you do not need to re-download the desktop client.
How do I use Webmail?
To use Outlook on the web (Webmail), the web-based email client for Microsoft 365, open a web browser and go to webmail.stanford.edu. Authenticate with your SUNet ID and SUNet ID password."
Email,IMAP/POP Access,"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol (POP) are protocols that allow you to store email messages on a mail server and then download and view the messages as though they were stored locally on a computer or device. IMAP allows users to see all mail folders on the server while POP only allows users to see the Inbox. Additionally, POP removes the emails from the server and stores them locally, while IMAP leaves the messages on the server.
IMAP and POP are not automatically enabled for university email accounts because they do not support two-step authentication.
IMPORTANT: To enhance the security of your Stanford email account, on October 31, University IT (UIT) disabled the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol (POP) for accounts that do not use these methods.
Two-step authentication support
The move to disable IMAP and POP where it is not used is part of an effort to ensure that two-step authentication is used whenever possible for accessing email. IMAP and POP do not support two-step authentication.
The following applications offer two-step authentication and are approved for use at the university:

Webmail
Outlook 2016 for Windows and Mac

Change impact
This change will have no impact on your ability to access your email.

Accounts that access email via webmail only will not experience any change.
Accounts that use IMAP or POP (or have within the past six months) will continue to have access to these protocols.

IMAP and POP will be disabled for accounts that have not used IMAP or POP in the past six months.
Support
If, at some time in the future, you need access to IMAP or POP, you can request that the appropriate protocol be re-enabled quickly by submitting a Help ticket."

Email,Microsoft 365 Known Issues,"Overview
Here are some known issues that may affect your experience.
The term Outlook refers to the Outlook desktop client while the term webmail refers to the web version.  Microsoft 365 refers to both.
New Webmail Issues
These issues were introduced following Microsoft’s update to Outlook for the Web in the Summer of 2019.
IssueWorkaroundAll appointments on shared calendars appear duplicated.Remove the shared calendar from your left hand column and re-add it by going to Import Calendar > From Directory. A support case has been opened with Microsoft in hopes they will provide a fix that doesn't require this step.Zoom plugin for Outlook on the Web does not appear when scheduling an appointment on a shared calendar.Begin by acting like you will create a meeting on your own calendar and click the Zoom plugin to add the Zoom information in the appointment *before* specifying which shared calendar will hold the meeting.Most or all print views from Outlook on the Web are incomplete, showing only the a few lines of the expected information.Use the desktop version of Outlook. Microsoft expects a fix by October 5th.Daily calendar will only print the current day's information—no ability to print the daily calendar for tomorrow, etc.Select the desired day in the mini calendar in the top left and then hit print.
Calendar issues
IssueWorkaroundYou notice missing calendar appointments, missing meeting updates, issues with accepting, declining, and sending meeting invitations, etc.Do not accept, decline, modify, or invite others to appointments from your mobile device. Calendar events should be treated as read-only on a mobile device.You have Free/Busy permissions to a shared calendar but the calendar won't open in Outlook for Mac or Apple Calendar.In order to access a shared calendar on a Mac client the calendar must be shared with a minimum of Reviewer permissions. See ""You do not have permission"" error message when you try to open a shared Calendar folder in Outlook for Mac for more information.Your  iPhone, OS version 9.1, is sending out multiple invitations or acceptances for meetings — both future and past.Turn off email and calendar syncing on your iPhone and then turn it back on. See How to Re-sync the iPhone or iPad Calendar for instructions.The email you receive after scheduling/accepting a meeting sometimes says that the meeting is scheduled using the UTC Monrovia, Reykjavik time zone instead of PST.This issue has been reported to Microsoft and they have acknowledged that it's a bug.

Email,Mailing List Service Policies and Guidelines,"Policies
Stanford's Mailing List service is provided and maintained by University IT. To prevent misuse of this service, University IT reviews list names, list purposes, and patterns of use to ensure that usage conforms to established policies.
Please review these Mailing List policies before you begin using the service:
The @lists service is bound by the general Computer and Network Usage Policy as well as the Fundamental Standard. Please read these policy documents.Mailing list service usage is ""opt in"" by policy. This means that you must have the person's explicit permission to add their email address to your list.A list using @lists services is a privileged use, not a right. Lists may be shut down, have their address name modified, etc., by the administrators of the @lists system without the consent of a particular mailing list owner if resource usage, verifiable complaints, and/or eminent University business requires it.The mailing lists service is not recommended for automated alert notification. If you must use a list for alert or report notification, please be sure to set a conservative notification interval. To protect general use of the list service, a list that uses excessive resources, may, without notice, be shut down and excessive messages removed.A list owner is responsible for keeping list member addresses current and active and for managing issues with their list. Any list that fails to have an identifiable active Stanford community member as an owner/administrator may be shut down without notice.A list owner is responsible for providing first-level support to list subscribers. This includes assistance with subscribing to and unsubscribing from lists, and responding to questions about list policy and charter.The @lists system administrators do not monitor the system for content but will respond to complaints from list users/members if/as necessary.All lists at the @lists service should have a defined charter. A list without a defined charter (a charter can be placed in the list information file) may be subject to being shut down without notice based on general verifiable complaints.Spam mailing and/or repeated verifiable off-topic postings are potential grounds for removal from any and all @lists lists, including list ownership.The @lists service is not to be used for general bulk mailings, nor one-time use lists.
@lists lists are not to be used for non-University (i.e., unrelated) business. This service is a campus resource for the campus community.

Usage recommendations
Place a list charter within the list information file. Define the topical focus of the list and the general acceptable language level of the list (business only, personal discussion encouraged, etc.).Do not use mailing lists to distribute calendar invitations.Norms learned in a particular e-mail environment may not apply in general to your email communication with people across the Internet. Be careful with slang or local acronyms.Be aware of what you are sending (size, content, etc.) and to whom you are sending it. Sending someone mail may also cost them in other specific ways like network bandwidth, disk space, or CPU usage in ways that may or may not be costs that apply to you as a sender.Consider that a large audience will see your posts. That may include your present or your next supervisor. Take care in what you write. Remember that mailing lists are frequently archived, and that your words may be stored for a very long time in a place to which many people have access.
Assume that individuals speak for themselves, and what they say does not represent their organization (unless stated explicitly).
Messages and articles should be brief and to the point. Don't wander off-topic, don't ramble, and don't send mail or post messages solely to point out other people's errors in typing or spelling. These, more than any other behavior, mark you as a beginner.Attach a signature to your message. This will guarantee that any peculiarities of mailers which strip header information will not delete the only reference in the message of how people may reach you.
Don't send large files to mailing lists when links to the file will do. If you want to send multiple files, be sure to follow the culture of the group. If you don't know what that is, ask.
If you are caught in an argument, keep the discussion focused on issues rather than the personalities involved.Don't get involved in flame wars. Neither post nor respond to incendiary material.Avoid sending messages which are no more than gratuitous replies to replies.Be careful with monospace fonts and diagrams. These will display differently on different systems, and with different mailers on the same system.
Stanford's mailing list management services
Stanford offers two services for mailing list management. Google Groups mailing lists is the recommended service and will become the primary mailing list management service. Mailman is a legacy service. However, certain functionalities are currently only available in Mailman. Compare Stanford's mailing list management services to determine which one best meets your needs.

Email,How to Send Secure Email,"Notes:

The Secure Email service does not automatically insert the email into the official medical record.
Secure email that is sent to Stanford's mailing list service (@lists.stanford.edu) must be sent to a secure mailing list. Otherwise, it  will be rejected.See How to Set up a Secure Mailing List for more information.
Secure:  can occur anywhere in the subject line of your message but always include the colon. Secure:  is not case sensitive — you can use any combination of upper and lower case letters
 Email with ""Secure:"" anywhere in the subject line is routed through the Secure Email server unless it is going to a trusted domain (e.g., a Stanford Email account, @stanfordchildrens.org, @stanfordhealthcare.org). Trusted domains receive secure email directly without having to verify identity.
Any email containing High Risk Data must include Secure: somewhere in the subject line, however it is recommended, and good practice, to include secure: in the subject line of any message that contains Moderate Risk Data as well. While your intended recipient may have an @stanford.edu, @stanfordchildrens.org, or @stanfordhealthcare.org address, you do not know where the message will be automatically forwarded or manually resent after being read by the original recipient.
Do not put sensitive data in the subject line because the subject line is not secured.
If you reply to a secure email, your reply will be sent securely provided that  ""Secure:"" is somewhere in the subject line. You do not need to remove the ""RE:"" from the subject line.

To send secure email:

If you are sending a message using a desktop client such as Outlook or Apple Mail, verify that your client is configured correctly. See Configuring Your Email Program to check your settings. The Secure Email settings are the same as those for regular email.If you are sending a message using webmail, your settings are correct so no action is required.
Put Secure: anywhere in the subject line of the message and then continue typing your subject line. (Be sure to include the colon.)Example subject line: Secure: Regarding Your Appointment
Compose your message and send it as you would normally."
Email,Secure Email with Forwarded Accounts,"You do not need to register your Stanford Email account (or that of other trusted domains such as @stanfordhealthcare.org or @stanfordchildrens.org) in order to read secure email. It arrives in your Inbox as any other message. However, if you forward your Stanford email to another mailbox, you need to register the final destination email address. For example, if your email is forwarded from Stanford to Gmail and you want to read secure messages in Gmail, you need to register the Gmail address.

Note: If you believe you are receiving secure email messages through a Stanford Email account but they appear as encrypted attachments, the messages have left the Stanford Email and Calendar service. It's possible that you are receiving your Stanford email via a department server using an alternate address. Please contact your local IT Support for more information about your final destination address.

To register the final destination of your forwarded Stanford Email account:
Launch your email program and log in to the account to which you are forwarding your Stanford email.Open a secure email message. It will have ""Secure:"" in the subject line and will have an attachment.Open the attachment.Register your email address with Proofpoint Encryption."

Email,How to Create a Spam Filter in Office 365 Webmail,"Overview
You can create a spam filter to automatically filter or delete email that has been labeled as spam by the Stanford spam filters.
The number of ""#"" signs (pound or number signs) after the word ""Spam:"" indicates how sure the system is that your email qualifies as spam. By default, all email marked with five # symbols is discarded before it reaches your mailbox. All mail marked with four # symbols is filed into a folder labeled Junk Email that can be accessed via Webmail or an email program. Messages more than 30 days old are automatically purged from your Junk Email folder.
The following instructions show you how to create a spam filter that filters emails marked with three or more # symbols into the Junk Email folder. You can make the filter more sensitive to spam by choosing to filter messages labeled with one or two # symbols.
You can choose to have messages discarded rather than moved to the Junk Email folder. However, the Stanford spam filters are not perfect. Legitimate email occasionally gets labeled as spam. Such mail usually gets a ""[SPAM:#]"" or ""[SPAM:##]"" tag. If you do choose to discard messages tagged as spam, that email is gone forever and cannot be restored.
Creating a spam filter

If you haven't already done so, go to webmail.stanford.edu and log in to your webmail account.
Click Settings (the gear icon in the upper-right corner) > Options.
In the Options panel, navigate to  Mail > Inbox and sweep rules.
Under Inbox rules, click the plus sign (+) to add a new rule.
Enter the following information in the New inbox rule dialog box:

Name: Spam Filter (or whatever name you want to call this filter)
When the message arrives, and it matches all of these conditions: It includes these words  > in the subject...
Specify words or phrases: enter [SPAM:### and click the plus sign then click OK.
Do all of the following: Move, copy, or delete > Move the message to folder
In the  Select folder dialog box, select Junk Email and then click OK.
Stop  processing more rules: checked (this prevents additional filters from being applied to a message after the first match so as to avoid contradictory actions)


Click OK to save your spam filter.
If you see a warning message about using Outlook Web App or Windows PowerShell to modify your rules. Click OK to save your webmail spam filter."
Email,Data Loss Prevention (DLP),"Background
To protect the University from the financial penalties and loss of reputation that result from High Risk Data being inappropriately released, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) appliances have been incorporated into Stanford's email infrastructure. Currently, these look only for Protected Health Information (PHI) that matches hospital records from Stanford Health Care or Stanford Children's Health. When a match is found in an email that was not sent via Secure Email the message is blocked from delivery and the sender is notified via email. Only data that matches hospital patient records should cause a message to be blocked. This technology has been successfully deployed in the two hospitals since 2013.
Email messages that are blocked by the DLP appliances are retained for a period of time to allow staff from Stanford's Privacy Office or the Stanford IT organizations to improve the accuracy of the protection rules in place.
User notification
When an email is blocked, the sender receives an automated email informing them of the block. A sample message is below:

Subject: Email Message Blocked
An email that you just sent has been blocked from delivery because it appears to contain High Risk Data such as protected health information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and was not sent via Stanford's secure email service.
When sending High Risk Data in the body of an email or as an attachment, always insert ""Secure:"" in the subject line to send the message securely.  While “secure:” is not case sensitive and can appear anywhere in the subject line, the trailing colon with no space between is required to trigger the secure email service.  See secureemail.stanford.edu for more information.
Please note that a copy of the blocked email will be retained and may be reviewed by staff from the University Privacy Office, Office of General Counsel, or the Information Security Office (ISO) for authorized investigations, or by University IT in response to user inquiries.
If you have any questions, please submit a help ticket via https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5174081613bce2008a9175c36144b0a9
For more information about Stanford’s data loss prevention (DLP) service for email, see dlp.stanford.edu.

Users can re-send the message, putting ""Secure:"" in the subject line in order to have it delivered.
Support
If you have any questions about DLP technology or need any information about why a specific message you sent was blocked please submit a Help ticket."

Web Tools,Office of Digital Accessibility Guide for Captions and Audio Descriptions,"Captions
Captions provide a text equivalent of the audio information of a video and are synchronized with the video presentation. Captions are an accessible alternative for individuals who cannot hear the content and includes the dialogue, speaker information, and any sound effects present in the video.
While the terms ""captions"" and ""subtitles"" are often used interchangeably, subtitles do not provide the same information and are designed for different purposes. Subtitles provide a text version of the dialogue only and often in different languages. Essentially, subtitles assume an audience can hear the audio but also need the dialogue provided as text.
Tips for captions
Include all spoken information as well as relevant parts of the soundtrack like background noises, sound effects, speaker identification, and any audio cues that help the viewer understand the video.Captions should be in the same language as the primary audio content.Use proper punctuation and grammar.

What videos need captions?
Videos promoting your program or attracting students, participants, and alumniVideos showcasing curriculum, research, exhibitions, or collectionsVideos profiling students, faculty, or researchersVideos providing instructions for how to apply or register for programsVideos listing news stories about your department or program
If you have questions about what types of videos to caption, please submit a Help Request. 
Captioning and live events
Before hosting a meeting or live event, please review the Digital Inclusion Checklist.
Auto-generated captions can include critical errors that impact the information or context of what is being communicated. A professional captioner has a higher level of accuracy compared to auto-generated captions but requires advanced scheduling to arrange for their service.
For assistance on real-time captioning as an accommodation, please submit a Help Request.
Zoom and captions
Zoom provides the capability of including captions from a professional captioner or to use auto-generated live captions from automatic speech recognition (ASR) engines. For live events that are not public-facing or in which there is no request for captioning services, follow these steps to enable the live transcription feature in Zoom:
As the host, go to Zoom Settings and In Meeting (Advanced).Move to the Closed Captioning option.Check the option “Enable live transcription service to show transcript on the side panel in-meeting.”Participants will then be able to choose to display auto-generated live captions during the Zoom meeting or event.
Captioning YouTube Videos
If using YouTube to publish your videos, you can add captions using YouTube's captioning interface. You can start with YouTube's auto-captions to create a draft transcript and then make updates to that transcript to correct for any errors. This YouTube video demonstrates steps for using YouTube's captioning interface to add accurate captions to a video.

Transcripts
A transcript is the same word-for-word content as captions but presented in a separate file. It provides a text alternative of the audio presentation and is not synchronized with the audio timeline. A transcript should contain relevant speaker information to distinguish who is saying what information.
Tips for transcripts
While transcripts may be provided for pre-recorded videos, they must be provided for audio-only content.Transcripts should include speaker information or any other informational cues appropriate to understanding the recording.If an audio or video was scripted before production the script can be used as the transcript.
Audio descriptions
Audio descriptions provide a verbal depiction of the key visual elements in a video presentation. For individuals who are blind, low-vision, or unable to view the video directly, audio descriptions communicate the important information relevant to understanding the video content. For example, a video may display a speaker’s name and title or specific instructions to follow. If this information is not included as part of the spoken dialogue, then it needs to be communicated as part of a separate audio description.
The Description Key from the Described and Captioned Media Program provides guidance for how to produce audio descriptions, including what to describe and how to describe on-screen information:
What to describeHow to describe visual content
Because audio descriptions exist as a separate track in the video presentation, it can be challenging to include these descriptions once the video is complete. A simpler way is to plan your script to describe any relevant on-screen information."
Web Tools,Hyperlinks,"Using descriptive text for hyperlinks helps website visitors scan for relevant information, identify outside resources, and choose which links are the most relevant for their needs.
In addition, some assistive technologies, such as screen readers for blind and visually-impaired individuals, have the ability to scan and present a list of all the hyperlinks available on a webpage. This allows a person to quickly jump to the relevant link instead of being forced to listen to the entire page line-by-line.
Tips for hyperlinks
Communicate the purpose or function of the hyperlink as part of the link name.Be as descriptive as possible without being overly long as some assistive technologies (e.g., screen-readers) will read the entire link text before moving to the next text content. Try keeping the hyperlink text under 120 characters.Integrate the link into your sentence, sighted users will see the link, and screen readers will hear the link.Ask yourself when writing a link text, ""Will the reader know where they are going just by the link text alone?""
Assistive Technology and Hyperlinks
Some assistive technologies can extract all the hyperlinks on a web page and present that information to the user. This allows an individual to quickly scan the hyperlinks and jump to the most relevant hyperlink on the page. 
 
The above example shows how a screen-reader could present the list of hyperlinks from the Stanford website. Providing descriptive link text can simplify interacting with electronic content and provide greater opportunity for the website visitor to find and engage with the information they are seeking.

Image Links
When using an image as a link, there are some specific rules that need to be followed. As discussed on the image ALT text concept pages, using an empty ALT text is fine for images that are purely decorative. However, as soon as you put an image inside of an anchor (link), then that image is no longer decorative, it is functional and the ALT text of the image needs to follow the function and not be descriptive of the actual image. For example: 
<a href=""https://stanford.edu"">
   <img src=""image.jpg"" alt=""Stanford University Homepage"">
</a>
There are some variations on this pattern though that should be addressed. If there is link text in addition to the image, then having an empty ALT text is preferred.
<a href=""https://stanford.edu"">
   <img src=""image.jpg"" alt="""">Stanford University
</a>
If the image link is redundant to another link that is adjacent to the image link, then removing that first link entirely from assistive technology is preferred. This involves two steps. First, remove the image link from the tab order using a negative tabindex value. Second, add an aria-hidden attribute to the image link (adding a role of presentation to the link would also work). In this case though, we need to add the ALT text back in for cases where a user might be using both a screen reader and a mouse (low vision users). 
<a href=""https://stanford.edu"" tabindex=""-1"" aria-hidden=""true"">
   <img src=""image.jpg"" alt=""Stanford University"">
</a>
[... snip ...]
<a href=""https://stanford.edu"">
   Stanford University
</a>"
Web Tools,Office of Digital Accessibility Guide for Color,"Color, like images, can add visual appeal and draw attention to important information on webpages and in documents. However, in order for colors need to be distinguishable in order to be accessible to a wide audience. From an accessibility perspective, poor color choices can affect individuals who are visually impaired or color blind as well as those trying to view content in sunlight or in glare conditions.
General rules for using color
Provide sufficient contrast between the foreground text information and background color.Avoid using pastel or “light” version of colors.Use color in combination with text-based information.
Contrast
When choosing colors to present text information the foreground to background contrast ratio should be a minimum of:
4.5:1 for regular text3:1 for 18 point font and larger, or 14 point font and bold
The contrast ratio is evaluated by comparing the foreground and background color choices. You can test contrast ratio using these tools:
WebAIM Contrast CheckerTPGi Color Contrast Analyser
Contrast Example
In the image below, the ""Welcome"" text is presented in a thin, yellow font superimposed over the aqua-colored background. This creates difficulty in viewing the text information due to the low contrast with the background colors.

By selecting a different font color and changing the background shading, the ""Welcome"" text is much easier to read due to greater contrast between the foreground text content and the background color.

Color
Color should not be used as the sole means of providing information. Individuals who are blind, visually impaired, or have certain types of color-blindness may not be able to discern what information is being communicated by color alone.
If color is used as the only means of providing information, then this requires that a person must discern between the color differences in order to understand the information. For example, the pie chart below lacks number labels that identify the size of each slice. This forces people to rely on interpreting the colors based on the legend.

For some individuals, particularly those who have difficulty perceiving certain colors, this can be about as useful as having the same pie chart displayed in all grayscale.

Combining color with additional information can improve comprehension for all individuals. In the following pie chart, labels are included that identify the data value and the category name on the chart in addition to displaying a legend. This results in a combination of both color and data to present information to the user."
Web Tools,Stanford Color Contrast Chart,"Choosing the appropriate foreground and background color combination is necessary to meet color accessibility requirements and support access for individuals with disabilities.
Interactive Color Chart Tool
The Stanford Identity Guide identifies multiple color options for communicating a recognizable Stanford message, Use the interactive color chat tool to choose a foreground and background color from Stanford’s color palette. You can also enter your own custom background color in HEX format (#000000) if the color is not in the menus. The tool will help you evaluate color combinations in order to meet the minimum threshold for accessibility.
Other Tools
If you’re designing content that requires colors outside of the existing Stanford color palette, there are other tools that allow you to evaluate the contrast of any two color combinations:

WebAIM: Contrast Checker
Color Contrast Accessibility Validator
TPGi: Color Contrast Checker (for Windows and macOS)"
Web Tools,Office of Digital Accessibility Guide for Images,"Images on web pages provide not only visual appeal, but many times also convey important information. Alternative text, called alt text for short, improves accessibility by providing a text equivalent of the information presented visually. Including alt text with your images ensures all individuals, regardless of visual ability, can engage with your content.
Alt text should be:

Accurate: including spelling, grammar, and proper punctuation.
Concise: using the fewest words possible while providing a meaningful description for the image.
Equivalent: presenting the same content and/or function of the image.

Assistive technologies will announce when an object is an image, so including this information is redundant and not necessary.
Tips for writing effective alt text

Describe the image as specifically as possible. 
Keep it short (around 125 characters or less).
Don't include ""image of,"" ""picture of,"" ""graphic of"" etc. 
Don't include the file extension, .jpg or .png, .gif, etc. 
If the image medium is important (such as a photograph or oil painting), then include the medium in your alt text.
Image buttons should have an alt attribute that describes the function of the button like, ""search,"" ""donate,"" “sign up,” etc.

Photos
The alt text will depend on the context and intention of the image. For the image below, the alt text could be ""XPP Instrument Area Manager Daniel Stefanescu prepares LCLS instruments for beam and experiments in the Chemistry Lab on the historic Stanford University campus. ""

Buttons
There are times when images also serve a function, like a button for example. In these cases, the alt text should communicate the function and include the appropriate text from the image. For the button below, the alt text could be ""Learn more about our research.""

Illustrations, graphs, and charts
Illustrations, graphs, and charts should include alt text that describes the important, relevant information. Instead of repeating every single data point in a chart or graph, it may be more effective to summarize the overall meaning or intent of the graphic representation. Following the image, the key elements may be presented as text on the page for an individual to read and review.
For the graph below, the alt text could be ""Graph depicting Stanford's path to reduced emissions from 2011 to 2021""
The text on the page could then identify the key elements as presented in the image, such as:
""Stanford's path to reduced emissions is demonstrated by the peak GHG emissions in 2011, to 2015 at 50% below peak with SESI going online, followed by 2016 and the first solar plant become available. In 2017 emissions were 68% below peak and attributed to on-campus rooftop solar. Projections indicate 2021 to be 80% below peak with a second solar plant becoming available.""

Punctuation
When considering punctuation for your image ALT text, the question comes up if you should end the alt text in a period, so that screen reader users know the description is finished as indicated by the pause added by the screen reader. The answer to that question is it depends.
When considering ALT text, adding punctuation depends on the context of the image and how it is used on the page, in addition to normal factors such as what the image looks like. While there are no hard and fast rules one way or the other, the following cases might give you some insight as to what you should do with ALT text punctuation. Also, consider that when a screen reader reads the content of an image, it will read the ALT text first, and then follow that with the word “image”. So, it is not important to add punctuation just for the sake of making the screen reader pause as the screen reader will already do that as part of the process of identifying the type of element it just read.
In the case however where the punctuation would be something other than a period, such as a question mark or exclamation mark, then that element should always be included. 
Case 1: Image links
When an image is being used as a link, then the alt text should function as the text for the link. In this case, it will be rare that adding punctuation to the end of the ALT text makes sense. 
<a href=""https://uit.stanford.edu/"">
   <img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""Add to Cart"">
</a>
Case 2: Short ALT text
When writing ALT text, one of the key principles is to write the text that is as concise as possible. When an ALT text is very short, such as when the ALT is just a few words, then adding punctuation does not make sense. For example, when including a headshot of a person, often the ALT text will just be the person's name, and adding punctuation at the end of this text isn't appropriate.
<img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""Leland Stanford"">
Case 3: 'Regular' ALT text
In this case, we are assuming that the ALT is approximately one sentence in length. This is the most ambiguous of the different cases in that it is entirely appropriate for the period to be present or not. Both of the following examples would be considered appropriate punctuation.
<img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""The Golden Gate Bridge at sunset with a large container ship traveling underneath"">
<img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""The Golden Gate Bridge at sunset with a large container ship traveling underneath."">
Case 4: Multiple sentences
The final case is when we have an ALT text that has multiple sentences in it. In this case, since there is already a period in the ALT text for one sentence, there should be the same for the second.
<img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""The Golden Gate Bridge at sunset. Photo courtesy John Smith, AP News."">
Decorative Images
Images that do not convey any meaning or are redundant to other information on the page should be considered decorative images and be given null ALT text of alt=””. It is important to remember that you must include this NULL alt text because without this empty alt attribute, screen reading programs will attempt to ‘guess’ as to what the information is by reading other elements, such as the file name of the image.
While there are no definitive standards that cover every possible scenario of what constitutes a decorative image, consider the following when making a decision:
Design elements
Elements such as borders and lines or other imagery that is exclusively for the design of the page are the most obvious elements that should be considered decorative. This includes any non-meaningful borders, lines, corners, shadows, or spacer images.
‘Stock’ Photos
Images may be included on web pages to convey a feeling about the page or provide some other visual interest, but do not provide any actual detail. Such images may come from a stock photo service or from other sources (it doesn't have to be from a stock service to be considered a stock photo). Per guidance from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, a stock photo or image used for ambiance (“eye-candy”) that is used only to add visual interest to the page can be marked as a decorative image.
For example, if you could swap out a photo with another image that completely replaces the people and places within it, but the ALT text wouldn’t change, then it’s probably a non-meaningful photo. When we look at the following image, the photo that accompanies these links to research areas could be any student in any lab on any campus and the alt text would be very similar if not the same.

An image showing a student in a lab on the Stanford Research page. While it could be argued that this is a meaningful image in some way, more than likely this should be considered a decorative ""stock"" photo as it only provides ‘eye candy’ to the more meaningful links and headings that accompany the image on the right.
Redundant Images
Images may also be used in conjunction with other text on the page without providing any additional content or information. For example, when looking at a list of events from the Stanford Events calendar (below), there is both the title of the story and the picture from the story. In this context, the image doesn’t provide any additional relevant information to a user that is trying to decide if they want to read additional details about the event or not. The events calendar is correctly done therefore by having a NULL alt text for each image. 

These events all have a thumbnail picture that accompanies the image title and details. While some of these images will be informative on the details page, in this context they should all be considered decorative and NULL alt text used. Note, if these images are also links, then other techniques need to be used to remove the image entirely from screen reader and keyboard-only users."
Web Tools,Office of Digital Accessibility Guide for Headings & Structure,"Take a quick look at a newspaper, magazine article, or even a novel. At a quick glance, you can easily ascertain the title, the titles of articles, the ""lead"" story, and major sections of content. The visual design and layout for all of these media types presents an organized and structured format that allows people to find information quickly and easily. This same approach can be applied to electronic content to support accessibility functionality.
Headings
Organizing content prevents cognitive overload, providing information in digestible pieces for your students. Headings are valuable in presenting the main points of a section, by providing a logical structure for information, or allowing visitors to skim the contents.
From an accessibility perspective, headings provide individuals using screen readers with a simple method to navigate within a page or a document. A recent WebAIM survey of screen-reader users found that using headings remains the predominant method for finding web page information and that over 80% of respondents found headings very useful or somewhat useful when navigating content. The use of headings allows individuals to move and find information in a more efficient manner.
Using different heading styles and font sizes helps organize information into meaningful sections and demonstrates how subtopics relate to the main topics, and with one another. For example, a document structure could be:

Heading 1 is the main topic or title of the content
Heading 2 is used for major subtopics that relate to the main content
Heading 3, Heading 4, and Heading 5 could be used to further refine related subtopics


For example, on the Stanford website, headings are used to indicate major sections and topics. The screenshot reveals the heading structure of the web page identifying heading 2 and heading 3 elements throughout the page. Not shown is the primary heading 1 of this page called Research.
General rules for headings

The main title should always be formatted as Heading 1. Subsequent headers should be applied in descending order. Don’t skip heading levels. For Example: Don’t use Heading 3 for the main title, followed by a Heading 1, and then a Heading 4.
Specify a heading element and then modify its appearance. Don’t use font size, bold, or underline features to create the appearance of a heading.

Lists
Lists neatly present related ideas and outline steps in a process. Bulleted and numbered lists can be used in documents to format, arrange, and emphasize text. For an individual using assistive technology, such as a screen-reader, the list format will communicate the presence and number of items in the list when navigating the content. This can help a person understand the overall scope of the list information and the number of items involved.
Bulleted List
If items are a group of equivalent ideas or terms, and the order is not an essential aspect of the concept, use a bulleted list. For example, the following is a list of basic accessibility practices for electronic documents:

Organize material into usable sections
Use styles to mark headings
Use meaningful words to identify hyperlinks
Provide text descriptions (i.e., alt text) for images

All of these accessibility practices are relevant to creating an accessible document. As such, a bulleted list can be used as it does not require a specific order or a sequence to follow.
Numbered List
If items are a sequence or a series of steps, use a numbered list. A numbered list is important when there are specific steps to perform as part of a process. For example, the following is a list of steps to take to login to email:

Open your web browser
Navigate to the email login page
Enter your user name and password
Press the Submit button

In this example, following a specific sequence of steps is necessary to complete the task successfully. When a specific order of operation is necessary to completing a task, then a numbered list is more effective in communicating those steps."
Web Tools,Accessible Canvas Pages,"Canvas is the learning management system (LMS) available for Stanford classes, providing instructors with a platform to communicate with students, post course materials, and create online assignments. Creating accessible Canvas pages can be accomplished by incorporating the following practices into your authoring process.
Headings & structureImagesHyperlinksTablesColorExtended time for Canvas quizzes
Headings & structure
Headings can provide an organizational and navigational framework for a document's content, communicating both the informational hierarchy and relationship between different sections. Headings also provide a simple mechanism for an individual using assistive technologies to ""jump"" from one heading to the next when navigating the document.
Highlight the brief word or phrase, or place your cursor on the line.In the Rich Content Editor select the styles dropdown menu to reveal Headings 2-4.

Heading guidelines
Headings should follow a logical structure that identifies content based on the organizational content and hierarchy of information in the document.Canvas automatically tags the page title as Heading 1. Page content headings should start at Heading 2.Avoid skipping heading levels.Headings should be short and succinct.
For additional guidance on formatting, please review the information on Structure.
Lists
Lists provide a structured order to a group of connected or sequential content. A numbered or bulleted list may present the same information more effectively than simple data tables with fewer steps.
Highlight the grouped text.In the rich content editor, select the appropriate list style (bullet or number list).

Formatting guidelines
Remove any lists created manually, such as those using dashes, asterisk, or other symbol characters.Avoid using indentation to provide a visual list in lieu of the list style button.Numbered lists are used to present a group of items (words, phrases, sentences) that follow a sequence.Bulleted lists are used for a group of items without a sequence.Lists should contain at least two or more list items, unless being used to create an outline.Nested lists are acceptable, such as a numbered list that contains a nested bulleted list.
Images
Images that support the content require a text description (also called ""alt text"") that communicates the purpose and/or content of the image. This information is presented to the individual using assistive technologies, allowing them to hear the description of the image. Image descriptions should be short and communicate the main purpose of the image. Images that are decorative can be marked as such and are ignored by assistive technologies.
If a longer description of the image is necessary to fully explain its content, consider inserting a more detailed description of the image within the document text that precedes and/or follows the image.
Adding Alt Text
Select the image. The image should be outlined blue and have four blue squares at each edge.When the image is selected, an Image Options will appear either above or below the image.If the image has pedagogical value, write a brief description in the Alt Text box.Select Done to save the information.

Image guidelines
A text description should convey the purpose or content of the image in approximately 120 characters or less. Avoid repeating the same information as contained in the surrounding text.If the image is decorative, select the Decorative Image checkboxIf the image is complex, use a short alt text description for the image and then provide additional information in the surrounding text of the document.Do not include the file format in the alt text (Example: .JPEG, .PNG).Do not include phrases “A picture of” or “An image of” as part of the alt text.
For additional guidance on writing effective text descriptions (i.e., alt text), please review the information on Images.
Hyperlinks
Documents containing hyperlinks to websites or other online resources can be improved by using descriptive link text that is understood by the reader instead of the full URL. Using the full URL as the link text may not make sense to the reader, particularly if it is long.
Link to an external resource
Highlight the text to be converted into a hyperlink.In the rich content editor,  select Links > External Links.In the Insert Link window, add the URL to the Link field. Select Done.
Edit an existing link
Place cursor on link. A submenu will appear. Select Link Options.In the Text field, write descriptive text. Select Done.
Hyperlink guidelines
Use link text that is descriptive and or informs the person as to the link’s destination.For additional guidance on formatting and descriptive link text, please review the information on Hyperlinks.
Tables
Tables in Canvas should be used for data and not layout purposes. An accessible table includes the following:
At least one header (row and/or column).Alt Text description summarizing the table.
The easiest method to ensure an accessible data table in Canvas is to use the Accessibility Checker. After you create the table in the Canvas Rich Content Editor, use the Accessibility Checker to add the appropriate table header information.
Create your Canvas page and then create a table.At the bottom of the editor, select the Accessibility Checker.In the drop-down menu Set a table header, select the appropriate header(s). Select Apply to save your work!Finally, under the Add a Caption field, write a brief and descriptive summary of the table. Select Apply to save your work!
Color
Color can be an effective method to communicate ideas and draw attention to information. Ensuring there is sufficient contrast as well as using color in combination with text formatting can support a diverse campus community, including individuals with visual disabilities. For additional guidance on using color and accessibility, please review the information on Color.
Contrast
When choosing colors to present text information in documents, avoid pastel colors or the “light” version of a particular color. Such color options do not provide sufficient contrast against a white background. Contrast ratios should be the following:
4.5:1 for regular text3:1 for 18 point font and larger, or 14 point font and bold
Contrast ratios may be evaluated using tools such as:
WebAIM Contrast CheckerThe Paciello Group Color Contrast Analyser
Color and formatting
When using color to indicate a specific condition or state, include text formatting to provide a distinguishing characteristic. For example, if a list of vocabulary words were identified only in red text, this could present difficulties for an individual who has a type of color-blindness.
Use color and formatting to support accessibility, such as:
Red text with Bold formattingUsing an asterisk, brackets, or other annotation symbols in addition to color
Extended time for Canvas quizzes
Some students may require additional time on a Canvas Quiz. Instructors can modify Canvas Quiz settings to allow for multiple attempts or to support students approved for an extended time. Please see the Canvas Instructor Guide: How to grant extra time or attempts in a quiz."
Web Tools,Accessible Google Slides Presentations,"Google Slides is a popular tool for creating slide show presentations. Improving the accessibility of Google Slides can be accomplished by incorporating the following practices into your authoring process.
StructureImagesHyperlinksExporting to MS PowerPoint
Structure
The structure of the content can provide an organizational and navigational framework for individuals to understand the informational hierarchy and relationship between different sections of content. These structural elements can help determine the organization and logical reading order of the presentation for an individual using assistive technologies. Google Slides provides three features, which assist with content structure: Slide Themes, Slide Layouts, and Slide Title.
More information about the advantages of using structure can be found on the Headings & Structure concepts page.
Slide title
The Slide Title is used to provide a heading for the slide's content. Slide titles should be unique and descriptive to help users navigate to specific content on the slides.

Slide layout
The Slide Layout provides templates with content regions in a predefined layout. Using a predefined slide layout will help ensure that the slide has the correct heading structure, numbered and bulleted list styles, and reading order.
In the toolbar, select Layout. Choose your desired layout.

Managing reading order
If creating separate text boxes that are not part of a preset layout, any of this content may not be in the correct reading order. When placing content manually onto a blank slide, you will need to assess and manage the reading order using the Arrange button in the toolbar.
Tab through the slide to see the reading order. The order in which elements are selected indicate the order in which they will be read.To change the reading order, select Arrange > Order.Send Backward will move the element to be read earlier in the reading order.Bring Forward will move the element to be read later in the reading order.Test the reading order with the Tab key again.

Although most Slide Layouts and Slide Themes contain slide titles - you may see a blank slide. To provide logical reading order, please note that every slide should have a Slide Title.
Images
Images that support the content require a text description (also called ""alternate text"") to communicate the purpose and/or content of the image. Image descriptions should be short and communicate the main purpose of the image. If a longer description of the image is necessary to fully explain its content, consider alternate strategies outlined on the Images page.
To add the alternate text:
Select the image. Right-click.Select Alt text.In the Alt Text window, write the alt text in the Description field.Select OK.

For additional guidance on writing effective text descriptions (i.e., alt text), please review the Images concept page.
Hyperlinks
Documents containing hyperlinks to websites or other online resources can be improved by including hyperlink text that is understood by the reader. For instance, using the full hyperlink URL may not make sense to the reader without some context.
Highlight the descriptive word or phrase that will become the hyperlink.Select Insert Link button in the rich content editor.Write the hyperlink in the Link field and select Apply.
Exporting to PowerPoint
If you plan to distribute your presentation to others as an MS PowerPoint, download the Google Slides as a PowerPoint Presentation and then run the Accessibility Checker from within PowerPoint. This can help identify any potential accessibility issues and prompt you for corrections.
Select File.Select Download.Select Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx).Download the file and run the Microsoft PowerPoint Accessibility Checker
The Accessibility Checker will identify potential accessibility issues in the downloaded PowerPoint file. The most common issue is the need to verify the reading order on each slide."
Web Tools,Accessible PowerPoint Presentations,"This documentation was created using Microsoft PowerPoint 365 for macOS.
Microsoft PowerPoint includes options for adding accessibility information to slides to support access by individuals with disabilities. This information also ensures that Microsoft PowerPoint files maintain a level of accessibility when converted into other formats (e.g., tagged PDF). Creating accessible PowerPoint presentations can be accomplished by incorporating the following practices into your authoring process.
StructureImagesHyperlinksColorTablesExporting to other formatsCreating a PDF of your presentation
Structure
The structure of the content can provide an organizational and navigational framework for individuals to understand the informational hierarchy and relationship between different sections of content. These structural elements can help determine the organization and logical reading order of the presentation for an individual using assistive technologies.
Slide Title
The Slide Title is used to provide a heading for the slide's content. Slide titles should be unique and descriptive to help users navigate to specific content on the slides. To view and edit slide titles quickly:
Select View.Select Outline View.Edit the titles accordingly.

If slide titles are the same, provide a numerical reference to differentiate the first slide from subsequent slides. For example, if there are two consecutive slides that cover the same topic, ""How do you use a webpage?"", consider adding a number or unique identifier to the end of the title. For example,  two titles with the same name could be identified as: “How do you use a webpage? Part 1” and “How do you use a webpage? Part 2”.
Slide Layout
Using preset slide layouts will automatically control the reading order and structure of content placed on the slide. To choose a slide layout:
To locate Slide Layout, select Home > select New Slide.Choose the slide layout that meets your needs.

For more information, read Microsoft’s support page, Apply a slide layout.
Managing Reading Order
If text boxes are separately created from the preset slide layouts, this information may not be in the correct reading order. If content is manually placed onto a blank slide, you will need to assess and manage the reading order using the Arrange button. To review and fix reading order:
Select Home > Arrange > Selection PaneThe reading order begins at the bottom of the list of regions. The first item to be read is at the bottom and the last item to be read is at the top.To modify the reading order in the Selection Pane, drag the appropriate item to the proper location in the sequence.

 
List
Use the built-in list styles to provide users additional guidance. Do the grouped items convey a process or have a logical sequence? If so, then use the number list style. Is this grouped list of items in no particular order? If so, then use the bullet list style.
Select Home.Select either the bullet or number list style.
Images
Images that support the content require a text description (also called ""alternate text"") to communicate the purpose and/or content of the image. Image descriptions should be short and communicate the main purpose of the image. If a longer description of the image is necessary to fully explain its content, consider alternate strategies outlined on the Images concept page.
To add the alternate text:
Right-click the image.Select Edit Alt Text…In the Alt Text window, write a descriptive text.

Image description guidelines
For additional guidance on writing effective text descriptions (i.e., alt text), please review theImages concepts page.
A text description should convey the purpose or content of the image in approximately 120 characters or less.Avoid repeating the same information as contained in the surrounding text.For images that are decorative not relevant to the content, use the check box Mark as decorative.If the image is complex, consider providing additional information in the surrounding text of the document while providing a shortened text description.Do not include the file format in the alt text (Example: .JPEG, .PNG).Do not include “picture of” or “image of” in the alt text.For older versions of PowerPoint, leave the Title field blank, and only use the Description field for alt text.
Hyperlinks
Documents containing hyperlinks to websites or other online resources can be improved by including hyperlink text that is understood by the reader. For instance, using the full hyperlink URL may not make sense to the reader without some context.
Highlight the short descriptive phase or words that will become the descriptive hyperlink.Select the Link button in the menu.In the Address field, add the desired URL.Select OK.

For additional guidance, please refer to the Hyperlinks concept page.
If the PowerPoint presentation is intended to also serve as a handout with resource hyperlinks, content authors may want to create a reference slide at the end that lists the full URL of the hyperlink.
Tables
When possible, use a simple table structure for tabular data. Using tables with split cells, merged cells, or nested tables can lead to issues with assistive technologies recognizing the appropriate column and row header information in a data table.
Avoid using a table to manage layout. Instead, use a Slide Layout that orients content into the appropriate visual layout you desire.
Tables should include the following:
At least one header (the row and/or column).Alt Text description summarizing the table.
Specify the header
To mark a header row for a data table:
Select the table to reveal Table Design. (Note: this tab will only appear if the table is selected.)In the far left-hand section, determine the required header type:
Header row: check the box Header Row.Column header: check the box First Column.


Color
Color can be an effective way to communicate ideas and draw attention to information. Insufficient color and contrast can limit the ability of others to perceive and understand the presentation.
PowerPoint offers a variety of slide themes, but not all of these will provide sufficient contrast. To edit Slide Theme colors:
Select Design > Expand the Color Palette Menu to reveal available color combinations.Select Colors to review the pre-built color palettes or select Customize Colors to create slides that have appropriate color contrast.
Select one with accessible contrast, or select Customize Colors to manually select the colors. Alternatively, you can use other methods in Microsoft PowerPoint to remove or change the current theme in your presentation.
For additional guidance, please refer to the Colors concept page.
Exporting to other formats
Do not use the ""Print"" to PDF option. This will create a PDF document that lacks PDF tags with no heading information, no alternative text, and no logical document structure. These types of PDF documents will create barriers when accessing the document with assistive technologies.
Creating a PDF

Improving the accessibility of Google Docs can be accomplished by incorporating the following practices into your authoring process.
Headings & structureImagesHyperlinksColorExporting to other formats
Headings & structure
Headings can provide an organizational and navigational framework for a document's content, communicating both the informational hierarchy and relationship between different sections. Headings also provide a simple mechanism for an individual using assistive technologies to ""jump"" from one heading to the next when navigating the document.
In the toolbar select the drop-down menu Styles button to reveal all headings.To make an item a heading in Google Docs, select the Styles drop-down menu, located to the left of the font drop-down menu.
Headings can be marked with the following keyboard commands:
Heading FunctionmacOS CommandWindows CommandApply Heading 1Command + Option + 1Ctrl + Alt + 1Apply Heading 2Command + Option + 2Ctrl + Alt + 2Apply Heading 3Command + Option + 3Ctrl + Alt + 3
Important considerations
Headings should follow a logical structure that identifies content based on the organizational content and hierarchy of information in the document.Avoid skipping heading levels - modify the style of the heading if you prefer a specific font or appearance.
Lists
Lists provide a structured order to a group of connected or sequential content. A numbered or bulleted list may present the same information more effectively than simple data tables with fewer steps.
Highlight the grouped list of items.In the toolbar, select the appropriate list style (i.e, numbered list or bulleted list).
Images
Images that support the content require a text description (also called ""alt text"") that communicates the purpose and/or content of the image. This information is presented to the individual using assistive technologies, allowing them to hear the description of the image. Image descriptions should be short and communicate the main purpose of the image. Images that are considered decorative can be marked as such and are ignored by assistive technologies.
If a longer description of the image is necessary to fully explain its content, consider inserting a more detailed description of the image within the document text that precedes and/or follows the image.
Adding Alt Text
Select and right-click the image.Select Alt Text.In the Description field, provide a brief and concise description and select OK.
For additional guidance on writing effective text descriptions (i.e., alt text), please review the information on Images.
Image guidelines
Alt text should be included in the ""Description"" field and not the ""Title"" field.A text description should convey the purpose or content of the image in approximately 120 characters or less. Avoid repeating the same information as contained in the surrounding text.If the image is complex, consider providing additional information in the surrounding text of the document while providing a shortened text description.Do not include the file format in the alt text (Example: .JPEG, .PNG).Do not include “picture of” or ""image of"" in the alt text.
Hyperlinks
Documents containing hyperlinks to websites or other online resources can be improved by including hyperlink text that is understood by the reader. Using the full URL as the hyperlink text may not make sense to the reader, particularly if it is long.
Place the cursor anywhere on the desired hyperlink. Right-click the hyperlink.Select Link.Under Text to Display, write the descriptive text for the hyperlink. Keep the text name short and descriptive.Select Apply.
Color
Color can be an effective method to communicate ideas and draw attention to information. Ensuring there is sufficient contrast as well as using color in combination with other formatting can support a diverse campus community, including individuals with visual disabilities. For more information on using color or these tools, please review the information on Color.
Contrast
When choosing colors to present text information in documents, choose color options that provide a contrast ratio of:
4.5:1 for regular text3:1 for 18 point font and larger, or 14 point font and bold
In general, pastel colors or the “light” version of a particular color do not provide sufficient contrast against a white background.
Contrast ratios may be evaluated using tools such as:
WebAIM Contrast Checker The Paciello Group Color Contrast Analyser
Color and formatting
When using color to indicate a specific condition or state, include some formatting attribute to also provide a distinguishing characteristic. For example, if a list of vocabulary words were identified only in red text, this could present difficulties for an individual who had some type of color-blindness.
Options to support accessibility can include a combination of color AND formatting, such as:
Red text with Bold formattingUsing an asterisk, brackets, or other annotation symbols in addition to color
Exporting to other formats
Google Docs to PDF
At this time Google Docs are not able to produce accessible PDF versions. If you export your Google Docs file as a PDF document, the accessibility information will not be included in the resulting PDF version. Instead, download your Google Doc as a Microsoft Word file to run the Accessibility Checker and convert to an accessible PDF.
In the toolbar menu, select File > Download > Microsoft Word (.docx).In Microsoft Word, run the Accessibility Checker, and address any accessibility issues before exporting to a PDF."

Web Tools,Setting up Social Sharing with Page Properties in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM),"Setting up Social Sharing with Page Properties in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
What Is Social Sharing?
You’ve probably seen attractively formatted links to articles and web pages on Twitter and Facebook that include a small box with features like a title, photo, and article summary/teaser. Here’s an example:

Large publishers and sites apply specific formatting to their pages to achieve this effect on Twitter and Facebook.
You can do this for your AEM pages, too, by using the Page Properties dialog.
Why Specify Social Sharing Data Myself?
Facebook, Twitter, and other sites will attempt to format content appropriately for social sharing. However, there are two reasons to provide this information yourself.
First of all, you will have more control over what content is displayed and how. For example, if you do not select an image, Facebook/Twitter will attempt to choose a content image from the page. This image may not look as good or represent the page content as well as you would like.
Secondly, it is easier to set up social sharing before a page is live than to make changes later. Some sites have tools to force an update to social sharing information, but not all do.
Add/Edit Headings and Descriptions
The name of your site appears by default. You can add/edit a page title and description on the “Basic” tab of the Page Properties. (See below)
Step 1: Select the “Page” tab in the toolkit
 
Step 2: Open “Page Properties”

Step 3: Use Page Properties to edit the text you want


Add/Edit an Image
Click the image tab in Page Properties to add or edit an image. Be aware that if you do not choose an image, Facebook/Twitter may attempt to select one from the page for you. How well that works will vary, depending on page content.

To add an image, drag it over from the DAM. DO NOT upload it from your desktop, it won’t save to AEM.
You can also crop or rotate the image if necessary.
Click “clear” to remove an image."
HR Systems,Tips for Using Axess,"1. Use a recommended browser
There are hundreds of potential operating system/browser combinations in the world, but only a handful are guaranteed to work properly with Axess. You are welcome to try logging in to Axess with any browser on any platform, but be aware that only the following browsers are certified to work successfully with Axess and the underlying PeopleSoft system:



CERTIFIED BROWSERS




Firefox 24 or higher


Internet Explorer 11 or higher


Chrome 35 or higher



Safari 6 or higherNote: If scroll bars fail to appear  in Safari, go to your Mac's System Preferences > General and select Show scroll bars - Always.




 





Users are strongly encouraged to use these recommended browsers, as other browsers may not be fully compatible with Axess/PeopleSoft. In addition:

Pop-up blockers must be turned off
Cookies must be enabled
Javascript must be enabled





 

""Why isn't my browser certified to work with Axess?""
The software behind the Axess system comes to us from external software vendors who build and test their products based on the current browsers in the marketplace. However, operating systems and browsers are constantly being updated, and it is almost impossible for large-scale, browser-based applications to adjust to each and every one of those changes. In some cases, OS/browser combinations other than those listed above may work, but we cannot guarantee that they will.
If you find your favorite browser does not work properly with Axess, please try using one of the recommended browser options listed above.
2. Clear your cache
Each time you access a web page via your browser, the browser stores the page in a temporary local ""cache"" for quick easy reference later. This can be useful for speeding up access to frequently-used pages, but it can also allow out-of-date pages to pop up and cause problems. Problems with access to web-based applications like Axess can frequently be resolved by clearing your cache.
See Clearing your browser cache for instructions for clearing cache and cookies for the most popular browsers.

PeopleSoft Training Center (for administrative staff)"
HR Systems,PeopleSoft Training Center,"Overview
This page provides information for users of the PeopleSoft Student Administration and HR modules. Those who use the PeopleSoft Learning Management System (known as ""STARS"" at Stanford) should see the Stanford Training and Registration System (STARS) page.
What training do I need to take?
Training is required in order to gain access to the PeopleSoft system. User training is provided primarily through online training modules. All new users must first complete the PeopleSoft Concepts & Compliance training module. Additional training requirements vary depending upon what function(s) you will perform in PeopleSoft:

HR Users: See the HR Management System website for requirements.
STARS Learning/Enrollment Administrators: See the STARS Course Administration & Reporting page for requirements.
Student Administration & Postdoc Web Forms Users: See PeopleSoft Training Requirements for details.

How do I get access to PeopleSoft?
There are multiple steps in the authority-granting process.
Prospective users of PeopleSoft HR should refer to the HR Management System page for information about obtaining access to the system.
For prospective Student Administration users, the process is as follows:

Complete the required training identified on the PeopleSoft Training Requirements page.
Your manager must submit a request to the Authority Grantor for your School or Business Area specifying the authority to be granted to you. The request must provide your name, SUNet ID, department, and job title/responsibilities.
The Authority Grantor enters role-specific transactions into Authority Manager to indicate the authority to be granted.
An automated process matches the Grantor's entries with training completion certification(s) entered in the system by the Training Administrator, and subsequently establishes the appropriate PeopleSoft security."
HR Systems,Online Learning Player Support,"What is the Online Learning Player?
The Online Learning Player provides animated and interactive demos showing how to perform various business tasks in Stanford's PeopleSoft system. You can view the demos passively in ""See It"" mode, or go through steps interactively in ""Try It"" mode.
Using the Online Learning Player
Upon launching the Online Learning Player, you will see a Table of Contents outline on the left side of the window. You can drill down through the table of contents by clicking the ""+"" buttons to get to the topic you'd like to view.
Playing a topic
Click on any title at any level of the table of contents outline; for most titles you will see related ""Concept"" information appear on the right side of the window. While not all titles have Concept information, it's a good idea to check for it before continuing to drill down to the individual topic level.
At the fully expanded level of the Table of Contents outline you will see Topic documents, denoted by a ""document"" icon rather than a ""book"" icon. Click on a Topic and the ""See It"" and ""Try It"" Playback Mode options display in the upper-left of the window.
With your topic selected, click either the See It or Try It button to launch the Player.

See It plays the lesson as a self-running demo.
Try It is more interactive, requiring you to click on the indicated links and enter values in fields.

Note that Try It also allows you to control the pace of the lesson, whereas See It plays at a set speed.
Tips for using the Player
Click the Pause button that appears in any of the instruction text bubbles in See It mode to pause playback.
Things moving a little too slowly for you in See It mode? Press your Enter key to advance forward to the next step/frame.
Click the Actions button in any of the instruction text bubbles within Try It mode to access additional playback controls:
Pressing the ESC key on your keyboard at any time in any mode will end playback and return you to the Table of Contents outline.
You may notice that the PeopleSoft Menu you see in the demos is much longer than what you see when logged on to PeopleSoft yourself; this is because each user sees only those menu options that are available to him or her based on user security. So don't worry if your list isn't as long as the ones you see in the demos!
Browser requirements for the Player

Windows users can run the Online Learning Player in Internet Explorer or FireFox.
Mac users must be using FireFox to run the Player.

Pop-up blockers must be turned off in order for the Player to run successfully. Windows users who have turned off pop-up blockers but still have trouble getting the Player to launch often have success by holding down the CTRL key as they click the See It or Try It buttons."

HR Systems,NIH Other Support Certification & Electronic Signatures – Adobe Sign vs Adobe Pro DC/Acrobat Reader KB,"Investigators are responsible for the complete disclosure of funding and resources and for the certification as required by NIH. Investigators must not ask their research administrators to certify on their behalf. Investigators should work with their administrative and financial teams to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their specific Other Support document—which the investigator certifies with their digital signature.
RMG has supplied documentation on this process:
https://med.stanford.edu/rmg/resources/federal-agency-disclosure/nih-other-support.html
PREFERRED METHOD: ADOBE SIGN
Investigators are expected to electronically sign with Adobe Sign. They can request the Adobe Sign account here: https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/35577f5cae634045977b75207d572ba9
If they already have an Adobe Sign account through the Stanford license, they may use that account so long as they are not in a PHI-settings enabled group. You can determine if they are in a PHI-setting group if the system forces them to Password Protect the document to be signed. If this is the case, use the Alternative Method via Adobe Pro/Adobe Acrobat Reader.
Instructions for how to use Adobe Sign for NIH Other Support Certification including what needs to be kept for internal records to comply with NIH’s requirements are located here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bgif-3w4ev8KqJPYkB_Oju1YftCk4sk1/view
POTENTIAL ISSUE: Users with an existing Adobe Pro account will receive error messages when trying to sign up/install Adobe sign. Adobe Sign needs to manually consolidate the two accounts. You will need to assist them with getting this resolved through Adobe Sign Support: Contacting Adobe Sign Support: KB00018623
ALTERNATE METHOD for ADOBE PRO DC/ADOBE ACROBAT READER:
Only if the user is in a PHI-settings enabled group for Adobe Sign should they use the alternative method via Adobe Pro/Adobe Acrobat Reader (otherwise, they need to setup Adobe Sign). You can determine if they are in a PHI-setting group if the system forces them to Password Protect the document to be signed.

HR Systems,Digital Signature - Adobe Sign,"Digital signature software offers an alternative to paper-based forms. Instead of completing and signing forms by hand, digital signature software allows users to complete and sign forms electronically.
When you need to collect information from an individual or a group of people, you can use digital signature software to create a custom form. You then use the software to send the form out to be completed and signed. The software routes the document to the recipients either in parallel or serial order, depending upon your designation. The software has a built-in tracking feature that sends notifications to you when a document is signed, and reminders when a document has not been signed.
This software helps prevent common mistakes, such as missing a required signature or using an outdated form.
Importantly, digital signatures are legally binding in most industrialized nations, having the same legal status as a handwritten signature.

Software Applications,CrowdStrike FAQs,"Below is a list of common questions and answers for the University’s new Endpoint Protection Software: https://uit.stanford.edu/service/edr
CrowdStrike for Endpoints
Q. What are my options for Anti-Malware as a Student or Staff for personally owned system?A. A free/low-cost option is Sophos Home, but we recommend researching online and assessing what best fits your needs.Q. Why is BigFix/Jamf recommended to be used with CrowdStrike?A. BigFix/Jamf aids in the maintenance and approval to run CrowdStrike optimally. CrowdStrike is a managed antivirus solution and is not recommended for VLRE users.Q. Will I see anything different?A. The biggest difference visually is the absence of icons in the Windows System Tray, status menu or menu bars.Q. If there are no icons, how do I know it’s running on my computer?
A. You now have the ability to verify if Crowdstrike is running through MyDevices. BigFix must be present on the system to report CrowdStrike status.​​Windows:
On Windows, open a Command Prompt window (Start > Windows System > Command Prompt)
On Windows, open a Command Prompt window (Start > Windows System > Command Prompt)
Run the following command to ensure that “STATE” is “RUNNING”
sc query csagent

On Macs, open Terminal window (Finder > Terminal)
Run the following command
(6.x Client) sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl statsYou will see a long output and basically looking for this:​


=== Communications ===Cloud Info
    Host: ts01-b.cloudsink.net
    Port: 443
    State: connected
 
You can check if you are on the 6.x client check by going to go your applications folder and clicking the Falcon icon.

For MacOS Mojave 10.14 through Catalina 10.15 to check if the kernel extension is approved and loaded by running the following terminal cmd:  ""kextstat | grep crowd"".If ""com.crowdstrike.sensor"" is displayed, it indicates that kernel extensions are approved and loaded successfully
​​Big Sur and later:

For macOS Big Sur 11.0 and later, to verify the Falcon system extension is enabled and activated by the operating system, run this command at a terminal:

systemextensionsctl list
The output shows the com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent system extension



1 extension(s)
--- com.apple.system_extension.endpoint_security
enabled active teamID bundleID (version) name [state]
* * X9E956P446 com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent (5.38/119.57) Agent [activated enabled]


Q. What are the Full Disk Access, Notifications and Network configurations for the falcon sensor for macOS?A. Yes. Full Disk Access is recommended for Mojave and required for Catalina and later. ​​You must grant Full Disk Access on each host. Administrator account permission is required:1. Click the Apple icon and open System Preferences, then click Security & Privacy.2. On the Privacy tab, if privacy settings are locked, click the lock icon and specify the password.3. In the left pane, select Full Disk Access.4. In the right pane, click the plus icon.5. In finder, find Falcon in the list of applications, or use Cmd+Shift+G to and navigate to for CS sensor version 6.x:  /Applications/Falcon.app6. Click Open7. Big Sur and later select Agent.8. Click the lock icon to re-lock privacy settings.                          Enable Notification to be alerted when CrowdStrike takes actions: System Preferences - Notifications & FocusNetwork: System Preferences - Network (this should be automatically added). If it is not added open a terminal shell and enter this command: Sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl enable-filterQ. Will it slow my computer down?
A. There is no perceptible performance impact on your computer. The Falcon sensor’s design makes it extremely lightweight (consuming 1% or less of CPU) and unobtrusive: there’s no UI, no pop-ups, no reboots, and all updates are performed silently and automatically.
Q. Will it prevent me from using my applications?
A. CrowdStrike uses multiple methods to prevent and detect malware. Those methods include machine learning, exploit blocking and indicators of attack. That said, unless specifically configured, CrowdStrike will NOT block legitimate applications.
In the event CrowdStrike has blocked legitimate software/process then please submit a ticket with as much detail as you can and the Information Security Office will review the circumstances and add an exception/unquarantine files if approved.  Once an exception has been submitted it can take up to 60 minutes to take effect.  
 
Q. What data is sent to the CrowdStrike servers?
A. CrowdStrike Falcon is designed to maximize customer visibility into real-time and historical endpoint security events by gathering event data needed to identify, understand and respond to attacks — but nothing more. This default set of system events focused on process execution is continually monitored for suspicious activity. When such activity is detected, additional data collection activities are initiated to better understand the situation and enable a timely response to the event, as needed or desired. Note that the specific data collected changes as we advance our capabilities and in response to changes in the threat landscape. Information related to activity on the endpoint is gathered via the Falcon sensor and made available to the customer via the secure Falcon web management console.
Detailed Sensor Event List
Q. How can I tell if there have been any threats blocked on my computer?
A. On Windows, CrowdStrike will show a pop-up notification to the end-user when the Falcon sensor blocks, kills, or quarantines. These messages will also show up in the Windows Event View under Applications and Service Logs. Sample popups:




macOS 
Q. Why do I need an uninstall Token?
A. Modern attacks by Malware include disabling AntiVirus on systems. CrowdStrike Falcon tamper protection guards against this.  Uninstall Tokens can be requested with a HelpSU ticket.  See How do I uninstall CrowdStrike for more information. 
Q. How do I uninstall CrowdStrike?
A. Windows: you can uninstall from Program & Features {submit maintenance token}
A. macOS: Open a terminal window and enter this command
[IMPORTANT] These steps need to be taken BEFORE running the uninstall on macOS
Check Security and Privacy - Full Disk Access and ensure Agent and CrowdStrike are listed if not add them.  (See FAQ: Q. What are the Full Disk Access, Notifications and Network configurations for the falcon sensor for macOS?)Remove the Jamf MDM profile. Removing the profile ensures Jamf will not auto reinstall CrowdStrike in 5 min however when removing the profile it also removes the profiles providing Full Disk Access to CrowdStrike which is needed to allow the uninstall to proceed.  Note: If you are on VENTURA and newer OS you must add the [Terminal App] to [Security & Privacy] -[App Managment] (see  FAQ: Q. What to do if you run into uninstall issues with Ventura)
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall --maintenance-token (enter) {submit maintenance token}
OR
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall -t (enter) {submit maintenance token}
Maintenance Tokens can be requested with a HelpSU ticket.  Please provide the following information:
(required) SUNetID of the system owner(required) Ownership: (Stanford/Personal/other-specify)
(one or more of the following)HostnameSerial NumberCrowdStrike ID1: (from mydevices)Licence Type: (from mydevices)
(required) Reason: (Troubleshooting, Leaving Stanford, Personal Machine no longer used for Stanford work.  )
Notes:
When the system is no longer used for Stanford business. If BigFix and or JAMF is installed, you MUST FIRST REMOVE these applications or CrowdStrike will/may be reinstalled automatically. Uninstalling because it was auto installed with BigFix and you are a Student.  Students should rerun the BigFix installer and select SU Group: Students to not have CrowdStrike re-installed. If you are uninstalling CrowdStrike for Troubleshooting; CrowdStrike will automatically be installed in 24 hours for Windows.  At this time macOS will need to be reinstalled manually.When the System is Stanford owned.  Many departments have opted to have their systems installed with CrowdStrike so if you are requesting for an uninstall token for reasons other than troubleshooting and it is blocking a legitimate application/process please the FAQ on “Will it prevent me from using my applications?” for a resolution.If you are a current student and had CrowdStrike installed.  It is likely due to the fact that when you installed BigFix you selected a department that has opted in to have machines installed with CrowdStrike.  Before removing CrowdStrike you will need to run the BigFix installer and select SU Group: Students to be exempted. School of Medicine Student and Staff enrolled in the SOM Data Security Program are required to have CrowdStrike installed.  This includes personally owned systems and whether you access high risk data or not.  
1.  The CrowdStrike Agent ID is a unique identifier for you machine and helps in locating your machine in the event there are duplicate machine names.  
Manually querying for your agent id:
Windows: reg query HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\CSAgent\Sim\ /f AGmacOS: sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats | grep agentID

 
Q. What to do if you run into uninstall issues with Ventura
Symptoms:When using “falconctl uninstall” to remove the sensor, Falcon.app may not be removed from the Applications folder
Users may also be presented with an error message in Terminal indicating that they do not have permission to modify files in Applications

Q. What is the command to install Crowdstrike on a host behind a proxy?A. For windows, using an elevated cmd prompt, the command is as follows:WindowsSensor.exe /install /quiet /norestart CID=enteryourCIDhere APP_PROXYNAME=enteryourproxyserverhere APP_PROXYPORT=enteryourporthere ProvWaitTime=3600000Please contact us for fixlet information in BigFix for bulk deployments.Q. How do I check if the Windows sensor is running?A. Running the following command is a standard step for troubleshooting the Falcon Sensor for Windows that to not only looks for the existence of a sensor, but verifies that it is actively running:
cmd = ""sc query csagent""
The output of this should return something like this:
        C:\Users\user> sc query csagent
        SERVICE_NAME: csagent        TYPE               : 2  FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER        STATE             : 4  RUNNING                                 (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)        WIN32_EXIT_CODE      : 0  (0x0)        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)        CHECKPOINT                 : 0x0        WAIT_HINT                     : 0x0
If the state reports that the service is not found, but there is not a CrowdStrike folder (see above): This is expected; proceed with deployment.
If the state reports that the service is not found, but there is a CrowdStrike folder (see above): There is a sensor present, but there is a problem with the Sensor.
If the state reads STOPPED: The sensor is present but not running, so there is a problem with the Sensor.
If the STATE returns STOPPED, there is a problem with the Sensor.  The next thing to check if the Sensor service is stopped is to examine how it's set to start.           Do this with: ""sc qc csagent""
       The response should look like:
        [SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
        SERVICE_NAME: csagent        TYPE                                : 2  FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER        START_TYPE                 : 1   SYSTEM_START        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL        BINARY_PATH_NAME     : \??\C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\CrowdStrike\csagent.sys        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   : FSFilter Activity Monitor        TAG                              : 0        DISPLAY_NAME       : CrowdStrike Falcon        DEPENDENCIES       : FltMgr        SERVICE_START_NAME :The important thing on this one is that the START_TYPE is set to SYSTEM_START.  The Sensor should be started with the system in order to function.  If this setting has been changed, perform the following: ""sc config csagent start= system""
Then start the service (no reboot required): ""sc start csagent""
You should receive a response that the csagent service is RUNNING.
If the csagent service fails to start to a RUNNING state and the start type reads SYSTEM, the most likely explanation is some form of Sensor corruption, and reinstalling the Sensor is the most expedient remediation.
Q. How do I verify Linux sensor connectivity?
Verifying that the sensor is running
Check running processes to verify the Falcon sensor is running: ps -e | grep -e falcon-sensor 
Check kernel modules to verify the Falcon sensor's kernel modules are running: lsmod | grep falcon 
Check the Falcon sensor's configurable options: sudo /opt/CrowdStrike/falconctl -gOptional parameters: 
--aid: the sensor's agent ID (Please feel free to  contact ISO for help as needed) 
--cid: your Customer ID (Please feel free to  contact ISO for help as needed) 
--apd: the sensor's proxy status (enabled or disabled) (This is only applicable if your host is behind a proxy server) 
--aph: the sensor's proxy host 
--app: the sensor's proxy port 
--version: the sensor's version number 
The sensor requires these runtime services:
network 
systemd 
local-fs 
sysinit 
multi-user 
shutdown 
Verifying the sensor files on disk
If the sensor is not running, verify that the sensor's application files exist on your host:
$ sudo ls -al /opt/CrowdStrike /opt/CrowdStrike/falcon-sensor
This should be a symlink to either:
the original sensor installation at /opt/CrowdStrike/falcon-sensor 
a sensor update package with a release build number, such as /opt/CrowdStrike/falcon-sensor3000

 
Troubleshooting Tips:
Q. How do I know if Crowdstrike is running (Windows OS)?A. To validate that the Falcon sensor for Windows , run the following cmd: sc.exe query csagentExpected output if the sensor is running:SERVICE_NAME: csagent
TYPE               : 2  FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER
STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                       (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
WAIT_HINT          : 0x0You can verify that the host is connected to the CrowdStrike cloud by running the following via an elevated cmd prompt:netstat.exe -fA successful connection will look like the following:
Active Connections
 
Proto   Local Address State     Foreign Address
TCP     192.0.2.130:49790    ec2-54-219-145-181.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:https  ESTABLISHED* In this example, ec2-54-219-145-181 indicates a connection to a specific IP address in the CrowdStrike cloud, 54.219.145.181 Q. How do I know if Crowdstrike is running (macOS)?A. Run this terminal command to determine if the host can connect to the cloud:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl statsIn the output, look for the Cloud Info section. A value of State: connected indicates the host is connected to the CrowdStrike cloud. Any other result indicates that the host is unable to connect to the CrowdStrike cloud.
Cloud Info
     IP: ts01-b.cloudsink.net
     Port: 443
     State: connected Cloud Activity

Verify the CrowdStrike system extensions has been allowed:
Sensor versions 6.11 and above on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
Confirm if the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor system extension has been allowed:
systemextensionsctl list
The output shows the com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent system extension:
1 extension(s) --- com.apple.system_extension.endpoint_security enabled active teamID bundleID (version) name [state] * * X9E956P446 com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent (5.38/119.57) Agent [activated enabled] 
Verify the CrowdStrike directories and files are present:
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
If you look for the presence of the Falcon.app directory and files and they are present, Falcon Sensor for Mac is likely installed:
/Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/
Loading and Unloading the Mac Sensor:If you believe the Sensor is installed but not running, but should be, for troubleshooting purposes, the Mac Sensor can be unloaded and loaded locally:
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
To unload:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl unload
This takes a few moments. The --maintenance-token switch may be required if your installation uses a maintenance token.
To load with maintenance token:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl unload --maintenance-token hit {Enter}enter the maintenance token informationTo load without maintenance token:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl load
Q. What are the steps where MyDevices is indicating CrowdStrike Anti-malware is not running (for macOS)?Symptoms:A. Occasionally we receive cases from IT members deploying the Falcon Sensor for MacOS where after a successful deployment of the sensor, the sensor fails to report into the Falcon console, which then translates to MyDevices.Cause:The cause of this issue has almost universally resulted from failing to follow up on the installation with the required step of applying the CID with Checksum (CCID) value to license the new sensor to the correct Falcon instance. 
If you have an existing Sensor install that is failing to connect, remove it first:

Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall

If the update policy has Uninstall and maintenance protection enabled, include the --maintenance-token argument at the end.sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall --maintenance-token {Enter}enter the maintenance token ID and hit {Enter} again

Note that the maintenance token can be obtained by contacting the UIT Service Desk team as a first line.
Also, ensure you are using a copy of the latest version/build installer. We always recommend using the latest available installer.
Open the .pkg file to run the installer. Alternatively, open a terminal and run:
$ sudo installer -verboseR -package <installer .pkg file> -target /
When prompted, enter credentials with software installation permissions. (This won't happen for JAMF deployments.)
Use the falconctl tool (built into the installer) to license and launch the sensor after installation, passing in your CID with Checksum (CCID):
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
Example for EDR:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl license xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
If you follow the above steps and continue to have issues getting your newly installed sensor to check in, please collect the following, substituting your actual hostname for $HOSTNAME and generate a SNOW ticket to ISO:
The output of Falcon sensor diagnostic.
$ sudo cp /private/tmp/falconctl_diagnose_*.tgz ~/$HOSTNAME_falconctl_diagnose.tgz
$ cp /var/log/system.log* ~/
$ cp /var/log/install.log ~/$HOSTNAME-install.log
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura: $ systemextensionsctl list > ~/$HOSTNAME-systemextension.txt
Q. Uninstall Mac sensor error - Error: The sensor has not loaded.% 
A. Symptoms:
The Mac sensor for CrowdStrike was not loaded correctly.
Applies To:
Mac SensorUninstall and maintenance protection turned on
Resolution:
Verify the current state of the sensor:
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats
If you receive the following error:Error: The sensor has not loaded.% sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl unloadIf the output requires a maintenance token, the sensor has tamper protection enabled. The next step will be to obtain the maintenance token with the Service Desk team. If an escalation is required, the SD team will coordinate with ISO.Then run:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl unload --maintenance-token hit {Enter}enter the maintenance token informationRun this command in the terminal to load the sensor: sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl load
After the sensor is loaded, you can proceed with uninstalling the sensor.
If Falcon is not yet licensed. Use the 'license' command first.% appears where:Error: InstallGuard is not ready%[Current Time] sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl loadError: Falcon is not yet licensed. Use the 'license' command first.%Cause
    The sensor is not licensed to your CustomerID (CID)    This is a required and separate step after the Falcon sensor for Mac installation is completed; the sensor installation is considered to be incomplete until it is licensed. 
After installing the Falcon sensor for Mac, remember to license the sensor by using this command, replacing <CCID> with your Falcon instance's CustomerID with Checksum (CCID):
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl licenseExample: sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl license xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Q. Uninstall Mac sensor error - Installguard is not ready, part 2
A. Symptoms:When attempting to uninstall CrowdStrike with a maintenance token, error ""InstallGuard is Not Ready"" appears.The following are steps to help resolve this issue: 
Open a terminal and run:
 
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats agent_info in order to obtain agent info such as the version and agentID. This can also inform you if the agent is running successfully:
=== agent_info ===
version: 6.35.14801.0agentID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcustomerID: [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
Sensor operational: true
Verify the version, and download the same version from Google Drive (Contact ISO on our our Slack Channel #iso-crowdstrike for access available to authorized Stanford Tech Support only].
 
To reinstall CrowdStrike, run the following:
 
$ sudo installer -verboseR -package FalconSensorMacOS.pkg -target /
 
When prompted, enter credentials with software installation permissions. (This won't happen for JAMF deployments.)
 
When the installation is complete, verify that the application is licensed appropriately:
 
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl license [xxxxx CONTACT ISO FOR LICENSE KEY xxxxx]
 
After licensing, you should be asked to approve a Network Extension and a System Extension:
If asked to ""filter network content"", select ""Allow"".
When the ""System Extension Blocked"" message appears, select ""Open Security Preferences""
In Security Preferences, on the General tab, select ""Allow"" to allow the Falcon system extension. You might need to click the lock icon to enable you to make security changes.If you do not approve the Falcon system extension when prompted on the host, run the falconctl load command to load Falcon again and show the prompts on the host for approval:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl load(Note: On macOS 10.15, you may receive an error stating that ""System policy prevents loading of CrowdStrike kernel extension ID com.crowdstrike.sensor"". This is expected and can be ignored.)
Run the following to verify that the sensor is operational:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats
You can now proceed to fully remove CrowdStrike:You can obtain a new token ID using the current process via Slack with the new agentID information, or contact ISO after the above steps have been performed.sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall --maintenance-token (press enter) {submit maintenance token}Q. What are the services that need full disk access (macOS) in order to successfully run CrowdStrike cmds from the Terminal
A. Symptoms: You run into permissions or operational errors1. If Falcon is installed, ensure that it has full disk access (this also applies to an end state of removing CrowdStrike)2. Make sure that Terminal has the right permissions to run cmds (reported errors similar to: getcwd: cannot access parent directories) will require you to allow the Terminal elevated permissions. You can remove this setting after your work is done.3. Make sure that systems extensions are enabled for CrowdStrike in Privacy & Security settings 
When the ""System Extension Blocked"" message appears, select ""Open Security Preferences""
In Security Preferences, on the General tab, select ""Allow"" to allow the Falcon system extension. You might need to click the lock icon to enable you to make security changes.If you do not approve the Falcon system extension when prompted on the host, run the falconctl load command to load Falcon again and show the prompts on the host for approval:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl load"

Secure Authentication,Web Login Help,"Why am I being asked to log in?
The service you requested requires that you identify yourself using your Stanford University Network (SUNet) ID. You must provide your SUNet ID and password to continue to the requested service or web page. (If you don't have a SUNet ID, see What if I don't have a SUNet ID, below.)
Under the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, your single web login gives you access to many other Stanford web sites besides the one you requested. In essence, you receive two keys when you log in: a key to the specific web site or service you requested, and a ""master"" key that opens other protected web sites as well. 
The keys last until you quit your browser program, or until they expire (they can last up to ten hours from the time of login). Always quit your browser before you leave your computer. Otherwise, someone else using the computer after you can get access to the Web—both to the sites for which you got specific keys as well as to any of the other Stanford websites that accept the master key.
What am I supposed to do?
Make sure that the web login page you see has the URL https://login.stanford.edu. Enter your SUNet ID and password and click on the Login button.
SUNet ID: Enter the login form of your SUNet ID, which is three to eight characters long.
Password: Enter the password associated with your SUNet ID. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it yourself.
What if I don't have a SUNet ID?
Most Stanford community members are eligible for a SUNet ID. To get one, go to Create a new SUNet ID. To learn more, visit the Accounts and Passwords documentation.

If you have forgotten your password, go to Accounts to reset it.
A message says you must enable cookies on your web browser:  Web login uses cookies for security and verification. Having a cookie for a Stanford website that requires a web login identifies you to the site and allows you to continue from one page to another without having to log in each time.

You took too long to log in: You must enter your SUNet ID and password within two hours of the web login screen appearing. Backing up to the web login page and trying again does not work; you must re-initiate the request for the web page or service you want.
Why am I being asked to authenticate?
When additional security is required, you are asked to use two-step authentication. 
You can be prompted to authenticate in a variety of situations, such as:

The site you are authenticating to requires it
Your browser or device has not been used before or has not been used in 90 days
You choose to require authentication each time you log in

Once prompted, you must use your two-step method to log in.
If you are unable to authenticate, you can go to Accounts to verify your identity. You can also change your two-step authentication devices, methods, and settings at Stanford Accounts. If you need assistance, please call the IT Service Desk at 650-725-4357 (5-HELP)."
Secure Authentication,Login and Two-Step Authentication FAQ,"Logging in

Q: I forgot my password. How can I log in?
A: Go to the Stanford University Accounts webpage and click the Forgot password? button, then follow the steps to reset your password.

Q: Why am I getting ""are you logging in"" messages when I'm not trying to log in?
A: If these are push-based Duo authentication prompts (i.e., Duo Push, SMS text, or Phone Call), then this could be an indication that an adversary has obtained your SUNet ID password and is attempting to log in as you. Two-step authentication is doing its job, and you should never approve an authentication prompt that you did not initiate or for which you cannot identify the source. See below for what to do about potential password compromise.This could also be the result of an application/service that you previously logged into encountering a session timeout. If the application can access a valid credential (such as a Cardinal Key certificate or cached Windows domain credential) that satisfies the SUNet ID password requirement but still requires two-step, then it will initiate a prompt on your behalf to restore the session. Some applications (i.e., NetDB, RegAdmin, self-service password reset) always require two-step authentication. Also, if you clicked the “Yes, trust browser” option in that device’s web browser, exceeding 90 days will cause the browser to prompt for two-step if you are logged in to Google Drive or any other web-SSO application. If you cannot determine the source of these prompts, see below for what to do.




Q: What should I do if I suspect my SUNet ID password might be compromised?
A: If you are receiving Duo prompts that you did not initiate, you should change your password as soon as possible. Most password compromises are the result of database breaches or successful phishing attacks, so it should not be taken as an indication that your local computer is also compromised. However, if you have any reason to suspect the computer you are working on is also compromised, please use a different computer to change your password.

Q: What if I have changed my SUNet ID password and I am still receiving Duo prompts that I did not initiate?
A: If the uninitiated Duo prompts still continue after you change your SUNet ID password (and it is unlikely the adversary could have obtained your new password), then it is more likely the result of some application attempting to recover from a session timeout on your behalf. Please restart your computer and any other remote sessions that you may have logged into. This should terminate the responsible session and allow you to approve any authentication prompts with confidence.



Q: What should I do if I suspect that I may have entered my SUNet ID password and Duo Mobile passcode into a malicious website?
A: Change your password as soon as possible using these instructions. Use your Duo Mobile passcode to two-step authenticate, as this will invalidate the previous passcode that was compromised.



Q: Why am I being prompted for my passcode when I usually use Duo push?
A: Regardless of what method Duo normally presents you, if you are presented with a two-step prompt where passcode is the only option, you should be wary. This is the most common method adversaries use to obtain your two-step credential (after previously collecting your SUNet ID password). You should cancel this session and double check the authenticity of the application link you are using.Additionally, with Duo Universal Prompt, it is no longer possible to select a default authentication method, like Duo Push, for all future two-step authentications. Instead, Duo will present you with the most secure out of the methods available to you. You may click Cancel and choose Other Options, which will then be presented to you next time (as the last authentication method from this device/browser combination).
Q: I used to receive Duo authentication prompts after entering my SUNet ID password, but now I am able to log in without two-step authentication.

A: Two-step authentication is always required after SUNet ID password authentication because a password is considered a weak form of authentication that is easily compromised. Cardinal Key is a stronger form of certificate-based authentication that some applications (i.e., Cardinal Key based VPN) deem to be sufficient, so no additional two-step authentication is required. Some highly sensitive applications (i.e., NetDB, RegAdmin, self-service password reset) will always prompt for two-step authentication even after Cardinal Key authentication.​This may also be because you are logging in with the same device/browser combination where you clicked the “Yes, trust browser” option.  If so, the browser will automatically remember you, and you will not be prompted to authenticate for that application or service for the next 90 days.



Q: Why are Duo Mobile passcodes no longer sufficient?
A: The Duo Mobile passcode remains valid until it, or a subsequently-generated passcode, is used. They are vulnerable to phishing attacks that are intricately designed to steal them before they expire, thus allowing malicious users to gain access to systems and user data. If you use Duo Mobile passcode, you should switch to a more secure authentication option, such as Duo Mobile Push, or use a security key. After Feb. 23, 2023, the Duo Mobile Passcode authentication method will be disabled.

Using two-step authentication devices and methods

What is the recommended two-step authentication method?
If you can authenticate with a smartphone or tablet, Duo Push is the recommended method; it is quick, simple, and secure. 
How can I use two-step authentication without a smartphone?
Authentication with a security key does not require an internet connection, cellular connection, or separate device. A security key can be ordered and self-enrolled by following these instructions. Tokens are available from the Stanford ID Card office.
You can also authenticate by a call to a mobile phone or a call to a landline.

My device does not have an internet or cellular connection when I travel. How can I use two-step authentication?
You can authenticate with the Duo Mobile app passcode, which requires a device but does not require an internet or cellular connection.
My default two-step authentication device has changed. How do I reset it?

The new prompt does not offer a way to configure a default authentication device (see ""Universal Prompt"" on the Duo support webpage).  Therefore, you can no longer set a default authentication method by navigating to accounts.stanford.edu and selecting the ""Two-Step Management"" tile.
Instead, you will always be prompted for your last-used authentication method.  If you select an option and authenticate with it, you will automatically be prompted with it until you authenticate with a different method. To choose a different authentication method from what is initially provided in the prompt, select “Other options."" ​

How do I change my default two-step authentication device?

To choose a different authentication method from what is initially provided in the prompt, select “Other options."" 

How can I get a security key for two-step authentication?
Purchase your choice of Yubikey and self-enroll it as a security key.
Can I use a printed list to authenticate?
You can no longer request a printed list for two-step authentication.
If you use a printed list for two-step authentication, choose one of these simple and reliable alternatives:


If you can authenticate with a smartphone or tablet, Duo Push is the recommended method; it is quick, simple, and secure.


Use the Duo Mobile app passcode, which requires a device but does not require an internet or cellular connection.


If you need to authenticate without an internet connection, cellular connection, and/or a smartphone or tablet:


A security key can be ordered and self-enrolled by following these instructions.


Use a hardware token, which is available from the Stanford ID Card office.


Use a call to a mobile phone or a call to a landline (not recommended).





Can I use SMS (text message) to authenticate?
University IT does not recommend using SMS for two-step authentication, because the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has reported that SMS authentication is less secure than other two-step authentication options. If you authenticate using SMS, consider changing to Duo Push. This recommended method is quick, simple, and secure. You can review other ways to authenticate on the Two-Step Authentication website.
 I self-enrolled my YubiKey as a Security key, but need to two-step authenticate for Shell Access and other non-web based services. How can I get my YubiKey to prompt for a YubiKey passcode?
​Firstly, ensure that your YubiKey can be programmed with a passcode, such as the YubiKey 5 Series. Then submit a HelpSU ticket requesting passcode programming for an existing YubiKey. A trained Duo administrator will schedule a working session to assist you.

Troubleshooting two-step authentication

I lost my two-step authentication device and don't have access to a backup device. How can I use two-step authentication?
You can generate a one-time bypass code on the Stanford University Accounts webpage using your University ID card and the answer to your password reset question.
I'm setting up a two-step authentication device but I want to cancel the setup. How do I cancel it?
It is a known Duo bug that there is no option to cancel the device setup process. We have reported this to Duo. As a workaround,  you can close the browser window and navigate back to the site to stop the setup process.
Why was I not asked to do legacy two-step authentication with web.stanford.edu?
Starting December 2023, duplicate multiple-factor authentication will be retired. See ""How to Fix Two-Step Authentication Issues with WebAuth Websites"" for more details.
My two-step authentication content does not load. What should I do?
If the two-step authentication content does not load, try disabling your ad blocker or third-party browser extensions.
My browser does not auto-fill the login address. What should I do?
If your browser doesn't auto-fill, it may be because you use a password manager. Login.stanford.edu uses a new URL so you need to re-enter your username and password in the password manager."

Overview
Two-step authentication uses two forms of authentication to verify your identity. First, you enter your SUNet ID and password. Then you need a physical device such as your mobile phone, tablet, or landline phone to complete the login. This approach protects your Stanford account from fraudulent access.
There are seven physical devices that you can use to provide the second factor of two-step authentication. Each device has one or more authentication methods available.

One device must be designated as your default device, and your default device must have a preferred way to authenticate. Stanford Login prompts you to authenticate using your default device and preferred method but you have the option of authenticating using a different device (if you have other devices set up) or method.
You are strongly encouraged to set up a backup device in case your primary device is lost or unavailable.
What to expect with two-step authentication
Once you enable two-step authentication, you may see an extra page after you sign into a Stanford resource via Login. If you are using a browser that you previously used to authenticate, you will be presented with the last-used authentication method. To choose a different authentication method from what is provided initially in the prompt, you can select Other options to choose one of the other options that may be available to you. How frequently you are asked to authenticate on your default device varies, depending upon:

the website you're accessing (for added security, some sites always require a two-step authentication)
your individual browser settings (whether or not you clear cookies)
whether or not you use more than one computer and web browser (two-step authentication is requested at least every 90 days for each computer and each browser you use to access protected websites)
if you are prompted with a screen that asks if you want to trust the browser. You’ll have the option to select “Yes, trust browser.” This takes the place of the “Remember Me” screen. If you click “Yes, trust browser” the browser will automatically remember you, and you will not be prompted to authenticate for that application or service for the next 90 days.

How you authenticate depends upon the device and method you chose for two-step authentication: 

If you chose Duo Mobile push notifications: a push notification is sent to the device, and you can review the request and tap Approve to authenticate. Internet or cellular access is required.
If you chose SMS text message: you receive a text message on your device containing a passcode. Enter the passcode on the two-step authentication screen to authenticate.
If you chose Phone Call: you receive an automated phone call that requires you to press or tap any key on your phone to authenticate.
If you chose Security Key: press the Security Key sensor when prompted to authenticate.

Overview
As part of an improved and simplified Cardinal Key experience, we are introducing a new browser experience for two-step authentication.

You’ll see a few screen changes, but everything will work much the same as now and will stay just as easy to use.
The core functionality of Duo Mobile isn’t changing. You’ll still be able to receive a Duo push and do anything the current version of the app does.
With the new screens, you'll see a changed URL in the address bar.  Currently, when you need to verify, the prompt displays within the Stanford login webpage with a login.stanford.edu URL. After the update, you’ll be directed to a webpage hosted with a duosecurity.com URL. 
With the change, you'll always be prompted for your last-used authentication method and can no longer set a default method.

Changes to the login experience

If you use Cardinal Key, the Stanford login screen you’re familiar with will be replaced by a “Select a certificate” pop-up when it's time to authenticate. If you see the pop-up shown below, simply select OK. This pop-up prompt replaces the Stanford login screen.Note: Those who are not yet using Cardinal Key will continue to enter a SUNet ID and password on the Stanford login screen, as usual.
For websites and applications that require two-step authentication, you’ll see a revised browser-based prompt to verify your two-step authentication.Note: Instead of showing the Duo prompt within a page hosted by the application [login.stanford.edu], the link will now redirect to a page hosted by Duo at [duosecurity.com] to show the Duo prompt and then redirect back to the protected application after completing the two-factor authentication.

When prompted for Two-Step Authentication, you will always be offered your last-used authentication method. If you choose Push as an authentication method, a login request will be sent to your device. 
To choose a different authentication method from what is provided initially in the prompt, you can select Other options to choose one of the other options that may be available to you.


Your next steps are the same as before. Open the Duo Mobile app on your device. You may see a message saying that you have a request waiting, displayed at the top of your screen. Tap the message.
Tap Approve to authenticate. If you get a request you were not expecting, tap Deny.
Once you have authenticated, you might see a screen that asks if you want to trust the browser. You’ll have the option to select “Yes, trust browser.” This takes the place of the “Remember Me” screen. 

If you click Yes, trust browser the browser will automatically remember you, and you will not be prompted to authenticate for that application or service for the next 90 days.
If you select No, do not trust this browser, you will still authenticate and continue onto your desired site; however, you will be prompted to re-authenticate each time you log into an application on that browser. 
Remember, public or shared computers shouldn’t be saved as trusted browsers.



Changes to devices & settings
The new prompt does not offer a way to configure a default authentication device (see ""Universal Prompt"" on the Duo support webpage).  Therefore, you can no longer set a default authentication method by navigating to accounts.stanford.edu and selecting the ""Two-Step"" tab.
Instead, you will always be prompted for your last-used authentication method.  If you select an option and authenticate with it, you will automatically be prompted with it until you authenticate with a different method. To choose a different authentication method from what is initially provided in the prompt, select “Other options.""

Secure Authentication,Windows: Connect to the Stanford VPN with a Cardinal Key,"Non-Stanford Devices that are managed by BigFix/VLRE and are compliant can use Cardinal Key to sign into VPN without multifactor authentication.
Note: If your device is not compliant, you will be unable to use Cardinal Key to connect to the Cisco Secure VPN.
You can connect to the Stanford VPN using a Cardinal Key on your device to authenticate. This eliminates the need to enter your SUNet ID, password, and authentication method for two-step authentication.
You'll need to use the Cisco Secure Client VPN client to connect to the Stanford VPN with a Cardinal Key.
Two types of Cardinal Key VPN connections are available:

CardinalKey-VPN (split-tunnel) allows access to anything at stanford.edu via the VPN connection but non-Stanford traffic flows normally on an unencrypted internet connection.
CardinalKey-FullTraffic (non-split-tunnel) encrypts all internet traffic from your computer but may inadvertently block you from using resources on your local network, such as a networked printer at home. However, this also allows access to library journals as if you were on campus.

Before you begin
Make sure you have the following installed on your device:

A Cardinal Key for Windows
Cisco Secure Client VPN client for Windows

Connect to the Stanford VPN using a Cardinal Key for Windows

Launch the Cisco Secure Client client. If you don't see Cisco Secure Client in the list of programs,  navigate to Cisco > Cisco Secure Client. 
When prompted for a VPN, enter su-vpn.stanford.edu and then click Connect. 
If you are prompted to select a certificate for authentication, then please select Stanford University MyDevices Intermediate CA certificate and click OK. 
In the Group list, select either CardinalKey-VPN  or CardinalKey-FullTraffic and then click OK.Note: This step downloads the Cardinal Key certificate for subsequent connections; it doesn't use the Cardinal Key for authentication on this connection.  
A notice briefly appears in the notification area to show that you are connected to su-vpn.stanford.edu. 
If you no longer require a VPN connection, click Disconnect to disconnect from su-vpn.stanford.edu. 
From the Cisco Secure client, select CardinalKey-VPN  or CardinalKey-Full Traffic.Once you have successfully connected to the Stanford VPN using a Cardinal Key, this becomes your default setting for subsequent connections to the VPN. 
A notice briefly appears in the notification area to show that you are connected to the VPN with a Cardinal Key.

Connect to the Stanford VPN without a Cardinal Key
If you decide that you do not want to use a Cardinal Key for authentication, you can connect using your SUNet ID and password, followed by two-step authentication. On the VPN website, see Connect to the Stanford VPN for instructions."
Secure Authentication,Using Your Cardinal Key,"Cardinal Keys simplify your login experience by reducing or eliminating the need to use your SUNet ID and password for web-based logins and VPN connections.
Get a  Cardinal Key
A different Cardinal Key needs to be installed on each device that you plan to use for Cardinal Key authentication.
Check the Cardinal Key requirements to make sure you can use a Cardinal Key on your device.Go to getcardinalkey.stanford.edu to download and install a Cardinal Key for your platform.
Use a Cardinal Key for Stanford Login (web single sign-on) authentication
Once your Cardinal Key is enabled, you'll be able to access Stanford Login-protected websites and web services without having to enter your SUNet ID and password. You will, however, still be prompted for two-step authentication.
Using a Cardinal Key with a Chrome or Safari browser
If you are using a Cardinal Key with a Chrome or Safari browser, you will be prompted to select a certificate to use for authentication each time you open your browser. This is true even if you have only one certificate installed on your computer. Select the certificate that represents your Cardinal Key.
If you choose a certificate that is not a valid Cardinal Key the page will not load and you'll get an error message.
Note for Mac users: The first time you use a Cardinal Key with Chrome or Safari you may be prompted to sign in to  your keychain. Enter you computer admin password and click Always Allow. You should not see this prompt again.

Use a Cardinal Key for VPN authentication
Connecting to the Stanford VPN with a Cardinal Key eliminates the need to authenticate with your SUNet ID, password, and two-step authentication.
Configure your device to connect to the Stanford VPN.
WindowsMaciOS

Cardinal Key VPN connections are split-tunnel. This means that all stanford.edu traffic goes through the VPN connection but non-Stanford traffic flows normally on an unencrypted internet connection."

Secure Authentication,Do I need VPN to access Stanford systems remotely?,"Many commonly used Stanford applications and services are available directly from the Internet without the use of VPN. While VPN does encrypt your data in transit, nearly all of the web-based applications you access already default to secure https communication, and are therefore already encrypted.
Examples of commonly used Stanford services which do not require VPN:
Office 365ZoomWebExAxessOracle FinancialsCisco JabberSlackGoogle DriveG Suite
University IT (UIT) recommends that you do not enable your VPN connection. Using VPN adds unnecessary additional overhead, which may degrade the user experience while connected, especially for video conferencing, streaming services, or applications.
Refer to the Learn more section on the VPN service page to view the most up-to-date FAQs."
Secure Authentication,I need to enable VPN. Do I use the split-tunnel or full-tunnel profile?,"If you do require a VPN connection, UIT recommends that you use the split-tunnel profile rather than full-tunnel. The split-tunnel profile enables the Internet-bound traffic to flow directly outbound via your home ISP, without first going to the Stanford VPN, and then route to the Internet. This also ensures better performance overall. Please remember that when using the full-tunnel profile, all traffic from your system routes first through the Stanford VPN and then out to the Internet.

Secure Authentication,How do I access restricted library journals from off-campus?,"Stanford University Libraries (SUL) updated the method by which authorized community members to access restricted journals from off-campus.
Rather than using Stanford's VPN (Virtual Private Network), SUL wants community members to use its EZProxy service: https://web.archive.org/web/20230426033350/https://library.stanford.edu/using/connecting-e-resources/connect-campus-faq
Refer to the Learn more section on the VPN service page to view the most up-to-date FAQs."
Secure Authentication,How can I tell if I need to use VPN?,"Many secure servers within the Stanford University network do require the use of VPN. There is no published list of these servers, but it is easy to quickly determine whether the server/system you are attempting to connect to requires VPN with this simple test: try performing daily duties without the VPN enabled. If you cannot access a service, enable the VPN and try again.
Refer to the Learn more section on the VPN service page to view the most up-to-date FAQs."
Secure Authentication,Delete a Cardinal Key on a Windows Device,"For compliance, please remove multiple Cardinal Keys. Having multiple Cardinal Keys can result in the Cardinal Key failing to authenticate access to restricted resources such as Google Drive for some users. 
Cardinal Keys are partially removed when you remove your device from MyDevices. Your computer record is removed from MyDevices and GetCardinalKey.stanford.edu, but the certificate remains on your device and needs to be removed manually. Please follow the steps below. If you do not plan on connecting your device to the Stanford network, then it is not necessary to remove the Cardinal Key certificate.
Before deleting a Cardinal Key, you can review the information in MyDevices to identify which Cardinal Key you want to delete. See View Your Cardinal Keys for instructions.
Either open Internet Explorer or click on Start, and search for ""Internet Options"". If you choose the latter option, skip to step three.Note: Internet Explorer is the only browser that has the functionality to delete Cardinal Keys.In Windows 10, click the Settings icon in the top-right corner and click Internet Options.In Windows 7, on the Tools menu click Internet Options.In the Internet Options window, click the Content tab.  Click Certificates and then click the Personal tab.Select the certificate (also known as Cardinal Key) you want to delete and then click Remove.Click Yes to confirm that you want to delete this certificate."
Secure Authentication,VPN Data Security,"Stanford VPN provides encryption from your computer to the Stanford VPN gateway. While Stanford VPN provides encryption between your computer and the Stanford network, be aware that other security measures, such as proper password use, operating system security patches, firewall settings, up-to-date virus scanners, and the like are still required to protect the data you are sending electronically. Please use caution and do not send your passwords or other confidential information as you would over a secure network. (Logging in to an HTTPS destination is OK.)If you are using a wireless network or are connecting from outside the Stanford network (for example, at a conference), it is recommended that you use Stanford VPN to connect to the Stanford network. (VPN use is for wired and wireless use.) If you are using a wired computer and are on the Stanford network, it is generally sufficient to use encrypted protocols such as SSH, HTTPS, and IMAPS instead of VPN. (Using VPN in this case would not measurably improve security.)"
Administrative Support,How to Create a New Workgroup with a Compliant Name,"University IT is helping Stanford University Box users migrate Box accounts owned by workgroups to Google Shared drives. To do this, we are creating Google Groups that will be the Google Shared drive owner, and are linking these with the appropriate Stanford workgroup.  
There is a known limitation in Google Drive that the name of a Google Group must be at least 9 characters long, not including the colon between stem and group name, and/or not be currently in use for a shared email box or resource calendar.
For us to migrate Box-owned workgroup accounts, we need a new Stanford Workgroup to be set up and linked to a Google Group, with a name that is longer than 9 characters - including the stem and the workgroup name.  
Action requested
If your Stanford workgroup doesn’t meet the requirements for migration, please follow the steps below to create a new workgroup and add the name to this Google sheet in the New Name column.
If your workgroup has more than one administrator, please coordinate with the other administrators as to who will perform the steps below:  
Create a new workgroup 


Go to Workgroup Manager.


From the left menu, click Create a New Workgroup.​


Enter the stem in the Group name part A dropdown. 


Enter the unique ID in the Group name part B dropdown. Make sure that there are at least 9 characters in the stem + name.


Enter a description of the workgroup.


Select how you want your workgroup to be nested or seen and then click Create Workgroup.​


Once the workgroup appears in your list of workgroups, click the name of the workgroup and click Add Members to add the same members and nested workgroups as are in the original workgroup. 


Click the name of the workgroup and select the Workgroup Integration tab at the top of the page.


In the Action column, click Link in the Google Group row - be sure NOT to change the name in the ""Link to new Google Group"" box.​


Add the new workgroup stem and name to this Google sheet in the New Name column.


Note: Creating a new workgroup stem and name will not affect your existing workgroup or Box linkage.

Technology Training,"The Requirement for Change Requests, When and Why","All production services, as well as all services with agreements that specifically state service levels and environment up-time, are subject to the Change Management process and policies.  This means that any configuration update made to a production service requires a change request, this includes things like:

apache/tomcat configuration changes
crontab updates
monitoring script changes
code updates or modifications
patching current or deploying new server/service
adding/removing users, user permission,
adding/removing memory, cpu or disk space
adding/replacing/removing any component: switch, power supply, network card, etc. 

Changes Requests are not needed for transactions within an application as the application control access and validates data being entered.  While changes within an application are not specifically required, in some cases they should be placed due to the impact of the change. If the change significantly affects the way the application works, it’s desirable to record the change so that if anything goes wrong, the change may provide clues as where to start looking. 
The goal of the Change Management process is to conduct a formal, standardized methodology in the handling of all Changes in order to be transparent on our work, prevent change-related incidents, minimize negative impact on delivery of services to our users and clients.

To improve the quality of changes by ensuring that a standard methodology is used to handle all changes and control the impact upon the day-to-day operations of the organization.
To reduce the potential for change induced incidents by providing a standard, formal, approach to handling a change.
To ensure that all changes are logged (or captured) in a centralized repository where the information can be shared by other processes.
To assess all changes based on their impact, benefit and risk to the business and to approve or decline the request for change accordingly.
To schedule all changes based on the requirements of the business, the availability of appropriate resources and in consideration of other changes being deployed.
To ensure that all changes are appropriately tested and certified and that the appropriate implementation and remediation plans are available.
To provide timely communication of change plans and schedules as well as the status of all changes to appropriate stakeholders and affected users.
To provide general reporting capabilities against the repository of changes, including trending information and specific metrics relevant to the process.

Technology Training,"Root Cause Analysis: ""5 Why's"" or ""Ishikawa diagram (Fishbone)"" (Problem Management)","Root Cause Analysis 
 
As part of Problem Management, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is the identification and description of the true cause/problem.  It includes identifying the timeline or history of events leading to the cause/problem and distinguishing between the technical or causal factors and underlying cause/problem.
 
Root Cause Analysis can be accomplished by using a variety of different techniques. The most common approaches for technology include : 
The 5 Why’s : Probably the simplest, uses interrogatives to explore the relationship underlying the incident by repeating the question “Why” to preceding answer of why.Ishikawa diagram (Fishbone) or Cause-Effect Analysis: Use of an illustrative diagram to describe various causes linked to the incident where each path  describes more detailed steps/causes. Events and Causal Factor Analysis :  identification of a series of task/actions in time sequence including environmental conditions of the task leading to the incident.Fault Tree Analysis : backward reasoning through successive refinements from general to specific.
 
The 5 Why’s  (from Wikipedia) 
""5 Whys is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem.[1] The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question ""Why?"". Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The ""5"" in the name derives from an anecdotal observation on the number of iterations needed to resolve the problem.
 
Not all problems have a single root cause. If one wishes to uncover multiple root causes, the method must be repeated asking a different sequence of questions each time.
 
The method provides no hard and fast rules about what lines of questions to explore, or how long to continue the search for additional root causes. Thus, even when the method is closely followed, the outcome still depends upon the knowledge and persistence of the people involved. "" (from Wikipedia)
Examples:
Example 1 : Application Service Impacted and users could not logon (application hung).
Why(1) was the application hung?  Answer: The server stop responding to requests.
Why(2) did server stop responding to requests?  Answer: The server ran out of disk space.
Why(3) did the server run out of disk space?   Answer: There was a significant amount or new log entries. 
Why(4) were there so many new log entries? Answer: New code migrated to production with log level set to high.
Why(5) was the new code delivered with the wrong log level setting?  Answer: Documented SDLC processes not followed (established guidelines on log level settings and code didn’t undergo performance testing).
Why(6 - optional) was the SDLC process not followed?  Answer: Management oversight lacking due to vacation schedule.
 
Example 2 : Network Device failure and clients can’t use internet to reach applications.
Why(1) was the network not available?  Answer: A network device failed.
Why(2) did the network device fail?  Answer: It was past it’s useful life (very old).
Why(3) was the network device not replaced?  Answer: The device position on the refresh list was incorrectly recorded and showed more useful life.
Why(4) was the device recorded incorrectly from the refresh list?  Answer: Visual inspection was not performed to confirm device age when the list was being update in violation of the established process. 
 
Example 3: General example of car trouble. 
Why(1) did the car stop running?.  Answer: The engine seized. 
Why(2) did the engine seize?  Answer: There was no oil left.
Why(3) was there no oil in the engine?  Answer: The oil drain plug was missing. 
Why(4) was the oil drain plug missing?  Answer: During yesterday’s oil change, the mechanic didn’t replace the oil drain plug.
Why(5) didn’t the mechanic replace the oil drain plug: Answer: The oil drain plug fell from the spot where mechanic placed it on the counter and his process is to check that location and not the oil pan before releasing the car.  (Bad process)

Security & Compliance Consulting,How to Request Electronic Access to Stanford Accounts,"Introduction
From time to time, Stanford employees or teams may have legitimate reasons to request access to an Individual’s data stored in Stanford-managed systems (Box, Google, Outlook, file server, data backup, end-user computer, etc).
For example, when faculty or staff leave Stanford (on a permanent or temporary basis, either voluntarily or involuntarily), they may have files or communications in their individual Stanford accounts that are necessary for ongoing operations or research. Access to such individual accounts may be granted only (1) with permission of the individual account owner, or (2) in accordance with Administrative Guide 6.1.1 (Privacy and Access to Electronic Information).
This document describes the process that the University Privacy Office (UPO) recommends for requesting access to such accounts of a person departing or no longer affiliated with Stanford (Departing Person) – including the roles and responsibilities of the person or team making the request (Requester), his or her direct Stanford manager (Manager) and Administrative Officer, UPO, Information Technology (IT), Human Resources (HR), and others.
Below are two methods for obtaining access to a Departing Person’s account.
 
Method 1: Consent from the Departing Person
The easiest and most efficient way to obtain access to a Departing Person’s account is to provide evidence of prior permission (such as document editor or co-owner rights) or obtain email permission from the Departing Person, before requesting access from IT.
Here are the steps:

Provide evidence that you’ve had prior permission from the user to electronic access (e.g. screenshot of prior sharing by user to you as a fellow co-owner or co-editor), or have IT check their logs for prior access rights.
Alternatively, the Requester can obtain email consent from the Departing Person to access the relevant accounts. The consent must specify:




the name(s) of the Stanford persons/teams to receive access,
the specific accounts to be accessed (e.g., Stanford University Box, Stanford Medicine Box, Stanford-managed Google account, Stanford managed Outlook account, etc.), and
any limitations on access (e.g., if access is to be limited to specific folders, files or emails).



For convenience, Attachment 1 (“Consent Template from Departing Person”) is a template that the Departing Person can complete and send to the Requester to grant permission.

The Requester opens a ServiceNow case with IT at https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services– and attaches the email permission to the ticket.
IT provides the necessary account access to the Requester.

There is no need for the University Privacy Office, HR, or Senior Executives to review or be involved where the Departing Person gives permission in Method 1.
 
Method 2: Compliance with Stanford Admin Guide 6.1.1(4)
In limited and exceptional circumstances, the Departing Person may not be in a position to grant permission via email. For example, the Departing Person may have passed away or become incapacitated, or may have been involuntarily terminated and is no longer on good terms with Stanford.
In such cases, the Requester will need to review and comply with the requirements of Stanford Administrative Guide 6.1.1(4), and coordinate with a number of different Stanford teams. For purposes of this process document, it is assumed that subsection 6.1.1(4)(d) (“Operational Circumstances”) applies.
See https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-6/subchapter-1/policy-6-1-1
Here are the steps:

If the Requester is not the Departing Person’s direct manager (Manager), the Requester coordinates with the Manager, and confirms that the Manager supports requests for electronic access.
The Manager reaches out to the relevant (a) Stanford HR Director (e.g. School of Medicine would be HR Director - Susan Hoerger) and (b) Stanford Administrative Officer (e.g., DFA, DFO, AVP, VP, Chair, Dean, Provost). The Manager explains the business justification for access to the account(s), and asks the HR Director and Administrative Officer to state in email that they support the requested access. For convenience, Attachment 2(see below “Template: Manager Email to HR Director and Administrative Officer”) is an email template that the Manager can use to document such support, which includes information required under Administrative Guide 6.1.1(4)(d) Operational Circumstances.
Once the Requester (and Manager, if different) have obtained email support from the appropriate HR Director and Administrative Officer, the Requester opens a ServiceNow case with UPO at https://privacyrequest.stanford.edu/– and attaches to the ticket the supporting emails from the HR Director and Administrative officer, obtained by the Manager in the previous step. In addition, if the Requester has previously submitted any ServiceNow tickets to IT related to the access request, the Requester should provide that IT ticket number to UPO, so the two cases can be associated.
Relying on the supporting HR and Administrative Officer emails that the request for access satisfies the conditions in Administrative Guide 6.1.1(4)(d) (e.g., if “failure to access the Information would likely cause the University to fail to meet mission-critical governance, administrative, teaching, or research obligations”), UPO will forward the HR and Administrative Officer’s emails to two “Authorizing Officials” (as defined in Administrative Guide 6.1.1(2)) – and ask for their approval. Typically, such Authorizing Officials will be Stanford’s (a) Chief Risk Officer, and (b) Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer. But depending on circumstances, the Authorizing Officials may alternatively include the University President, Provost, Vice President of Business Affairs, General Counsel, or Vice Provost of Student Affairs.
If the two Authorizing Officials approve access, University Privacy Office will then open a case at the “Request Stanford User Data Access” portal which directs IT Subject Matter Leads to fulfill the request for the Requestor’s associated IT ticket. (Concurrently, UPO will notify and close the Requester’s ServiceNow case with UPO.)
Requester coordinates directly with IT to obtain access with UPO and Two Authorizing Officials’ approval in place. Before accessing any data, Requester should understand and acknowledge the following:




By default, IT will grant access only for thirty (30) days or transfer the data if practical. If the Requester requires more time, s/he should coordinate directly with IT. In such cases, IT may require additional approvals/sponsorship of the relevant administrative officer, as there may be additional costs associated with holding the account open for a longer period.
Requester’s access to the Departing Person’s information must stay within the scope described in the approvals submitted, and must in all cases be related to the performance of Stanford’s research, educational and operational activities – consistent with the requirements set forth in Stanford Administrative Guide 6.1.1, Section 4(d).
In complying with the “minimum necessary” principle defined under Admin Guide 6.1.1 1.c.v, the Requestor must limit access to minimum necessary in order to accomplish the business purpose and onward sharing of the Departing Person’s files, folders and communications only to those specific individuals with a legitimate need-to-know to fulfill Stanford’s research, educational and operational objectives. The Requester should avoid accessing any potentially personal content in the Departing Person’s Box, Google or Outlook accounts.
In the event of any data incident (including any potential unauthorized access to personal data), the Requester must immediately report the incident to UPO at https://privacyrequest.stanford.edu/



Questions about this process should be directed to UPO, by opening a case at https://privacyrequest.stanford.edu/.

TEMPLATE: MANAGER EMAIL
TO HR DIRECTOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER
Below is a template email which can be completed and sent by the Departing Person’s Manager to request the appropriate University HR Director and Administrative Officer (e.g., DFA, DFO, AVP, VP, or Provost) to provide administrative approval.
Dear [insert names of HR Director and Administrative Officer]
I am writing to request your support of the grant of access to electronic information of a former Stanford employee. Specifically:

The following person was previously on my team, and is no longer with Stanford for the following reason: [insert name of departing person, SUNet ID, title, department, and reason why no longer at Stanford – e.g., deceased, incapacitated, involuntarily terminated, etc.]

Security & Compliance Consulting,Minimum Security Standards Frequently Asked Questions,"Compliance and Exception Process:

Q: When is a MinSec standard exception needed?
A: When a minsec standard as a whole cannot be met. For example, a minsec exception is not needed when a single, or small subset, of patches cannot be applied as specified by the Patching standard.
Q: How do I get started bringing my servers into compliance with the Stanford Minimum Security Standards (MinSec)?
A: To get started bringing your servers into compliance with the MinSec standards, the Information Security Office (ISO) has developed quick start guides for Information Security on Stanford managed Linux and Windows servers. Please see the Windows MinSec Cookbook and the Linux MinSec Cookbook for more information.
Q: What if I cannot meet some or all of the Minimum Security Standards for my servers, applications, or endpoints? Can I request a compliance exception? Who should submit the request?
A: If you cannot meet some or all of these standards for your servers or applications, please fill out the temporary Minimum Security Standards server and application exception request. These requests should be submitted by the server or application Business Owner. If you cannot meet some or all of these standards for your endpoints, please fill out the temporary Minimum Security Compliance Exception Request form. These requests should be submitted by the endpoint's primary user. See Request a MinSec Exception for more information.
Q: Is there a different process for processing exception requests for endpoints vs. servers and applications?
A: Yes. The endpoint compliance exception request form starts a review process that is managed in RedCap, while the server and application exception request starts a review process that is managed in ServiceNow.
Q: Do I need to submit a temporary exception request for each of my servers/applications?
A: You can submit one exception request for all servers/applications for which you want an exception from the same standard(s).
Q: My current system/application is not MinSec compliant, but will be replaced by a different system/application in the future. I don't want to divert resources to update a system that is going to go away in X amount of time. Can I submit a MinSec exception until the old system is decommissioned?
A: No. If a system/application is not meeting MinSec compliance, but there is a plan to replace it with a newer MinSec compliant system, the existing system will simply stay non-compliant until decommissioned.
Q: What are the eligibility criteria for a temporary Minimum Security Compliance Exception for my server or application?

A: A server or application is eligible if:

It is not supported by (up-to-date) OS or application
The OS or application cannot meet a specific minsec standard because of a technical dependency. Exception may be granted on a case-by-case basis as long as there is an upgrade plan on a system that is scheduled to be decommissioned or replaced by another system.
No updates are available for a vendor supported system
The system does not support password complexity requirements


Q: How long does a MinSec exception last?
A: An approved MinSec Temporary Exception for servers/applications will be valid for up to three years at the discretion of the Information Security Office. An approved MinSec Temporary Compliance Exception for endpoints will be valid for up to one year.
Q: I am having trouble meeting the MinSec deadline for my systems; can I get an extension by submitting an exception request?
A: Minimum Security Standards Exception Requests are intended for servers and applications that cannot meet MinSec standards, not as an extension for MinSec compliance deadlines.

Patching:

Q: I cannot patch my system because the reboot will cause an outage of the service to my end users.
A: System managers and business owners should have negotiated maintenance windows for their systems that allow for the application of security patches on a schedule that is in compliance with the Minimum Security Standards.
Q: I cannot patch my system because I am unsure whether the patches will break a custom application.
A: System managers should have test environments in place to perform impact analysis of changes to their environment. Exception requests will not be granted based on a suspicion of an impact that has not been validated by testing or vendor input.

Vulnerability Management:

Q: Where can I get an overview of my systems' information security vulnerabilities?
A: Submit a request for a Qualys account, then log in to Qualys to view vulnerabilities. For more information, see the Vulnerability Management service page.
Q: For Qualys reported vulnerabilities, do I need to address “potential” vulnerabilities or just “confirmed” vulnerabilities?
A: In order to meet MinSec compliance, both potential and confirmed vulnerabilities need to be addressed.
Q: In what order should I prioritize mitigation for potential and confirmed Severity 3/4/5 vulnerabilities?

A: Mitigation for confirmed and potential vulnerabilities should be prioritized in the order shown in the following table, ranging from 1 (highest priority) to 18 (lowest priority).
Mitigation Prioritization


Severity
Server Classification: High
Server Classification: Moderate
Server Classification: Low


5 - Confirmed
1

18




Q: If Qualys shows a vulnerability and there is no patch available from the vendor, is a MinSec exception needed?
A: No. If there is no patch from a vendor for a vulnerability reported in Qualys, a minsec exception is not needed. In the absence of a patch, explore other alternate solutions and compensating controls that may be recommended by the vendor.
Q: How do I handle false-positive vulnerabilities in Qualys?
A: If Qualys is showing a vulnerability that is investigated and found to be a false-positive, a minsec exception is not needed. Sysadmin should go into Qualys and set false-positive vulnerability as Ignored and denote that vulnerability is a false-positive in the comments section.
Q: Who is responsible for updating Qualys for false-positives?
A: Each organization is responsible for managing their own assets in Qualys, including ignoring vulnerabilities that are false positives.
Q: How can I request Qualys API access?
A: Go to https://stanford.service-now.com/services?id=get_help&cmdb_ci=acd7c11a1374e20063eadf82e144b07d and request a Qualys API account. ISO will work with you to identify the appropriate API account permissions.
Q: What does “Remediate” mean in the Vulnerability Management standard?
A: To investigate identified vulnerabilities, ignoring false-positives in Qualys, addressing any configuration problems, and/or applying patches when available from the vendor.

Whole Disk Encryption:

Q: Is the BitLocker Startup Pin required to be compliant for whole disk encryption?
A: It is highly recommended that all BitLocker features, including a startup pin, be utilized; however, the startup pin can be removed for systems that require unattended reboots.

Inventory:

Q: Who should be updating each organization's IT System Inventory worksheets each month to reflect current MinSec adoption status?
A: Each organization has designated a point person who is accountable for ensuring that their inventory worksheet and MinSec adoption status is updated on a monthly basis. Please contact your ISO Consulting liaison if you do not know who that person is. The Operations Owner for each server and/or application is responsible for informing the associated Business Owner of any changes to that server or application’s MinSec adoption status. The Operations Owner is also responsible for providing this information to their organization’s accountable point person to make the update to their inventory worksheet, unless their point person has delegated to them the responsibility and ability to update their server or application’s information in the inventory worksheet themselves.

Firewall:

Q: Do host-based firewalls have to be configured to allow port scanning by Qualys scanners?

A: Host-based firewalls should permit only the minimum necessary ports/protocols, blocking everything else that does not support a business need. A system administrator should not explicitly block Qualys scanner IP addresses.
Network-based firewalls should permit ISO vulnerability scans to pass through unfettered.


Two-Step Authentication:

Q: If I have two-step authentication on my VPN, do I still need it on my server?
A: Yes, two-step authentication must be installed on your server to comply with Minimum Security Standards. For installation instructions, see Two-Step Authentication for Servers and Applications.
Q: I am running a system that does not support two-step authentication. What is an adequate compensating control to mitigate the security risk?
A: Any authentication mechanism such as RADIUS that enforces two-step authentication is a suitable compensating control for systems that do not support native two-step authentication. Alternatively, the Stanford University Network Access Control (SUNAC) service can also be used as a compensating control.

Centralized Logging:

Q: Is sending logs to a University Splunk instance required to meet this standard?
A: While University Splunk is not required, ISO may require logs from critical systems to be sent to Splunk for security monitoring and incident investigation.

Sysadmin and Developer Training:

Q: How can I tell if someone completed a SISA class this calendar year?
A: Ask the employee to review their STARS Training History and send you their completion certificate or a screen capture of the completed course.
Q: How can I satisfy the sysadmin/developer training requirement if I cannot attend one of the in-person classes?
A: You can take one of the online (self-paced) classes which does not require previous completion of the Information Security I prerequisite.

Malware Protection:

Q: How do I satisfy the Malware Protection and Intrusion Detection MinSec standards on my Windows server?
A: Windows Servers can satisfy both of these MinSec requirements by implementing CrowdStrike

Intrusion Detection:

Q: How do I satisfy the Intrusion Detection MinSec standard on my Linux server?
A: Linux servers satisfy the Intrusion Detection requirement by implementing File Integrity Monitoring with OSSEC. Legacy systems that cannot run OSSEC can also satisfy this requirement using TripWire.

Physical Protection:

Q: What kind of data center do I need to comply with the Physical Protection MinSec standard?
A: The system administrator should use their own judgment. The intent of this standard is to ensure that servers cannot be easily stolen. Servers should be housed behind a locked door, and access should be restricted to authorized sysadmins only, preferably with a spring-loaded door, video surveillance, and a card reader. A locked office does not suffice.

Dedicated Admin Workstation:

Q: What is a PAW and who needs one?

A: Please see the Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) service page for more information about PAWs, and who is required to obtain one.


Security, Privacy, and Legal Review:

Q: Do I need to file a Privacy, Security, and Legal review for my existing systems?
A: No, a Privacy, Security, and Legal review is not needed for existing systems.

Regulated Data Security Controls:

Q: If my systems are MinSec compliant, does that mean they are also HIPAA or PCI-DSS compliant?
A: No, in order to meet specific regulatory security control requirements, your system must also meet the appropriate security requirements. For example, in order to meet HIPAA requirements, your system also has to meet the HIPAA Administrative, Technical, and Physical Security Rules."

Although already highly secure, there are some circumstances in which you might choose to add another layer of encryption to further safeguard data from unauthorized access.
For extra security, you can add an Archive key password to your account. This advanced option should only be considered if you are comfortable managing your own backups and fastidiously handling your passwords.
The default encryption scheme is sufficient for most use cases. Consequently, as a matter of policy, some organizations disable the Archive key password option to ensure persistent data accessibility.
Limitations
Adding an Archive key password, in addition to your Account password, means that only you have access to your archives. No one, including the company that sells CrashPlan or anyone at Stanford, will be able to view your files. Importantly, your local IT support team will no longer be able restore files on your behalf if you submit a Help ticket.
If you forget your Archive key password, all your data will be inaccessible. You will need to reset all of your backups from scratch.
Get started
If you decide to add an Archive key password, the password must be applied to all your devices and all of your data will need to be re-backed-up in order to be newly encrypted. You will lose any historical archives on all your devices and you cannot downgrade to using Account key passwords only, unless you start everything again.

Contact your local IT support team to enable the enhanced Archive key password. See the CrashPlan documentation for instructions to setup and use an Archive key password.

Backup,Adjusting Memory Allocation to CrashPlan,"Adjusting the memory allocation
CrashPlan might run out of memory and crash when de-duplicating and backing up large file systems greater than 1TB or one million files. You can experiment raising maximum amount of of RAM that CrashPlan can use to prevent incomplete backups. 
Adjust app settings for memory usage with large backups (Enterprise)"
Backup,CrashPlan File Exclusions,"By default, CrashPlan service backs up your entire system to the Stanford Internet2 Cloud, excluding certain file types and directories. Virtual machine files, log files, most application directories, the operating system and other file types are excluded. Users can still choose to back up these files using external storage or to other computers in their account.
Still other files and directories are always excluded. Global exclusions include caches, ephemeral data, temp directories and incompatible file types. Additionally, any file or folder named _NoBackup will always be excluded. 
This exclusion list only applies to organizations that subscribe to the ITS settings and configurations.
Groups that locally support their CrashPlan deployment may have different includes/excludes. Check with your local IT support group for more information. Some exclusions are specific to Macs, Windows, Linux or Solaris. See what gets excluded per CrashPlan best practices."
Backup,CrashPlan Limitations and Considerations,"Appropriate use
CrashPlan is intended to protect laptops and desktops over any internet connection, for users with active SUNet accounts.
This software can no longer be newly installed on machines running Windows Server operating systems. Use on Linux servers is discouraged. CrashPlan backup service is not a substitute for a long-term storage or data archive strategy. It is intended to provide a measure of security when files are accidentally deleted, a hardware component fails or a computer is lost.
Performance
Most computers on campus will take advantage of Internet2 networking for enhanced performance. Home users with slow internet upload speeds will find reduced performance.
For best results, especially during the initial backup, use Stanford’s wired (Ethernet) network and temporarily prevent your computer from falling asleep. 
As a general rule, CrashPlan might not perform as expected on computers with more than 2 TB data or  several million files. Actual performance depends on the amount of physical RAM, network throughput, disk speeds, CPU efficiency, and other factors. Review this support article if CrashPlan is running out of memory and crashing due to large file systems. Adjust app settings for memory usage with large backups with this support article.
Additional considerations
Users who depend on cellular data networks (“tethering”) for network connectivity should configure CrashPlan to avoid using their mobile hotspot to avoid costly plan overages. See CrashPlan network configuration documentation to learn how to adjust client network settings.
Because archives are encrypted using an algorithm based on a person's SUNet credentials, they cannot be transferred to another user.  
Microsoft Outlook users must take extra precautions to make sure their data is properly protected. CrashPlan has separate support articles for backup and restore.
Special considerations should be taken when backing up certain types of open files, like databases. See CrashPlan support documentation for more information.
Do not back up virtual machine files created on your computer using applications like VMware Fusion or Parallels. Instead, install CrashPlan inside the virtual machine itself."
Backup,"Ordering, Billing, and Deploying CrashPlan","Ordering
Departments may order CrashPlan backup via OrderIT. Members of the Stanford community with an active SUNet account are eligible. Service is intended for home, office, and remote computers that are related to employment.
This service is acceptable for all risk classification types. To safeguard Protected Health Information (PHI), users with this type of data on their computer must submit a Request to ensure that all backup data is handled appropriately. 
Deploying
Deploying apps to specific organizations requires a unique deployment policy, created and maintained by a customer cloud admin role (equivalent of a system administrator). 
Organizations purchase one license per user. Each user may have up to four devices. 
To prevent unexpected charges, organizations can request a cap to the number of licenses associated with this license key. Submit a Request to later adjust the quota.
Learn more about strategies for deploying to user devices here.
Billing
This service is a ongoing subscription, with billing adjustments made each month. Subscribing organizations are billed for the actual number of licenses in use when tallied in the last week of the month. Monthly recurring charges are thus adjusted according to the actual number of licenses in use. 
Cancelling
A license is considered “in use” if the user account still has archive data in retention. Simply having a user depart your organization or Stanford, or the computer be unreachable, unused, blocked, suspended or de-authorized, does not mean the license will be automatically returned or the billing adjusted downward. Your local IT support organization that manages your CrashPlan subscription will need to manually deactivate a user account through the admin console. This will automatically and permanently delete all the data associated with that user account, and your organization will not be charged further for that license.
Refer to the Stanford Admin Guide Section 6.2.1 under the section concerning Computer and Network Usage Policy for information on the appropriate use for information resources, including CrashPlan backup service.
Installers
Installers can be downloaded from the Admin Console (use server address: http://clients.us2.crashplan.com/).
Please note that custom installers will no longer be updated."
Backup,How CrashPlan Works,"Continuous backup
CrashPlan (formerly CrashPlan PROe) provides “continuous backup” that’s different from other, more traditional backup applications. Rather than kick off a resource-intensive backup session once or twice a day, it's much more lightweight and unobtrusive. 
CrashPlan uses your computer’s built-in notification system to learn about changes to your data. It listens to your operating system to learn when files have been added, removed or modified. It queues up the eligible files, then compresses and encrypts the data prior to sending them over the network. This happens every fifteen minutes by default.
Just to make sure no files were missed, there is a once-a-day disk scan to account for any changes that might have been overlooked. This usually happens around noon each day. If your computer was turned off, that scan will take place later in the day.
Initial backup, subsequent protection
After the initial backup is complete, only the changed bytes of any given file is sent subsequently. Additionally, on a per-device basis, CrashPlan provides deduplication to make backups more efficient.
To restore data, use the secure web interface to recover a few files, or use the desktop software for larger tasks. See the CrashPlan documentation to learn about restoring files.
The integrity of your backups are verified regularly by the software. Any corruption in the backup archive will be identified and the original files are backed up again to ensure protection. 
Resource efficient
By default, CrashPlan uses minimal CPU and network resources while your computer is being used. Users can throttle the network usage to prevent disruptions on home networks, too."
Backup,Change The User Account Associated With Code42 (Formerly CrashPlan),"On June 11, 2018, the CrashPlan service for the School of Medicine was upgraded. The newer version is expected to help with a variety of bugs which have been impacting some backups and restores. Please note that the branding for CrashPlan has been changed to ""Code42"" with this upgrade and the interface and icons have also changed.

When Code42 is first configured, it requires a user to sign into their account before it can begin backing up. From that time on, Code42 will back up all data to that user's account. If another user inherits that computer, and it has not been wiped, the new user will need to sign out the previous user to change the account that Code42 backs up to.
Below are the steps to sign out the previous user in both Code42 and CrashPlan. If you still have CrashPlan, your CrashPlan will be automatically updated to Code42.
Sign out the previous user in Code42

Open the Code42 app
On a PC, press these three keys together: Ctrl, Shift, and C. On a Mac, press these three keys together: Option, Command, and C.
In the ""Commands"" window, type: deauthorize
Press Enter

After closing the command window, the sign in screen will appear. The new user can now sign in with their SUNet ID and SUNet ID password.
Note: First time Code42/CrashPlan users should select the New Account option when signing in.
Sign out the previous user in CrashPlan

Open the CrashPlan app

Network Access,How to Configure Cisco Secure Client VPN Client for Windows,"Overview
Stanford's VPN allows you to connect to Stanford's network as if you were on campus, making access to restricted services possible. To connect to the VPN from your Windows computer, you need to install the Cisco Secure Client VPN client.
Two types of VPN are available:

Default Stanford (split-tunnel). When using Stanford's VPN from home, we generally recommend using the Default Stanford split-tunnel VPN. This routes and encrypts all traffic going to Stanford sites and systems through the Stanford network as if you were on campus. All non-Stanford traffic proceeds to its destination directly.
Full Traffic (non-split-tunnel). This encrypts all internet traffic from your computer but may inadvertently block you from using resources on your local network, such as a networked printer at home. If you are traveling or using wi-fi in an untrusted location like a coffee shop or hotel, you may wish to encrypt all of your internet traffic through the Full Traffic non-split-tunnel VPN to provide an additional layer of security.

Network Access,How to Configure Built-in VPN Client for Mac OS X,"The Cisco AnyConnect VPN client for Mac is recommended.  The built-in VPN client for Mac OS is another option but is more likely to suffer from disconnects.

Stanford's VPN allows you to connect to Stanford's network as if you were on campus, making access to restricted services possible.
Two types of VPN are available:
Default  (split-tunnel).  When using Stanford's VPN from home, we generally recommend using the default split-tunnel VPN. This routes and encrypts all traffic going to Stanford sites and systems through the Stanford network as if you were on campus. All non-Stanford traffic proceeds to its destination directly.Full Traffic (non-split-tunnel).  This encrypts all internet traffic from your computer but may inadvertently block you from using resources on your local network, such as a networked printer at home. If you are traveling or using wi-fi in an untrusted location like a coffee shop or hotel, you may wish to encrypt all of your internet traffic through the Full Traffic non-split-tunnel VPN to provide an additional layer of security.
The VPN type is determined by the authentication settings, which are entered during the configuration.
Configure the built-in VPN client

Network Access,Cardinal Key Resources for IT Professionals: Shared Devices,"This page includes instructions intended for IT professionals who are supporting the use of Cardinal Key on shared devices.
Instructions for IT Professionals
Prerequisites
The device must be enrolled in BigFix (eventually, Jamf should also be able to support this setup).Only macOS and Windows are supported.Each user must have their own account on the local system.Each user must be a local administrator.One user of the device (could be a sysadmin or tech support person) must be the primary user (responsible party) so that the device will appear in their list in MyDevices.
Set-up steps
It is recommended that the primary user should be the first to install their Cardinal Key. Each user must individually complete the following steps:
Complete the device enrollment process while logged on to their own local computer account.Install their own Cardinal Key, using either the guided installer or manual installation.If the guided installer was used, the process is now complete and the user may log out immediately.In the case of manual installation, the user must stay logged in long enough for BigFix to collect Cardinal Key data and report it to MyDevices. (Users should remain logged in for two hours.)
Caveats
During device enrollment, the question about High Risk data confuses some folks.  If any user (not just the primary user) says ""yes"" to High Risk data access, the computer will be considered to have High Risk data access.The device will appear in the MyDevices list of the primary user only.MyDevices can sometimes be slow to update. Allow up to 12 hours for a newly installed Cardinal Key to appear in MyDevices.The Cardinal Keys will appear with the names given them at installation time (by default either the machine name, in the case of the Cardinal Key Installer, or the OS name, in the case of a manual installation)There’s no lifecycle management: if a local user account is deleted, for example, any associated Cardinal Key will still show in MyDevices in perpetuity, even though the certificate itself was deleted along with the user account."
Network Access,Setting up eduroam: Android,"Important notes for devices running Android 11
Beginning with Android version 11, it is no longer possible to choose a ""do not validate"" option in the ""CA certificate"" dropdown. Even trusted CAs (Certificate Authorities) like the RADIUS server certificate, which used to authenticate eduroam, must be validated by your device.
Remove current eduroam configuration
If you have previously set up your eduroam connection without certificate validation, you'll be unable to connect after you've upgraded to Android 11. To reconnect, you'll need to remove the current configuration for eduroam and manually install a Cardinal Key Root CA certificate. To remove any current configuration for eduroam, follow these steps:
Open Settings and then access Wi-Fi options.Tap and hold eduroam. If the option to ""Forget network"" appears, then select it and continue.If the option to ""Forget network"" does not appear, you can still continue with the steps below to manually install a Cardinal Key Root CA certificate.
Android 11: Connect to eduroam (optional for Android 9 and 10)
To connect to eduroam, you must manually install a Cardinal Key Root CA certificate on your device (this is a one-time step). To do this, make sure your device is connected to the internet and follow these steps:
Download the Cardinal Key Root CA certificate (cardinalkey-root.cer) on your device.Follow Google's instructions to add a certificate.Configure the eduroam settings as follows:
When prompted to choose the uses for the certificate(s), select both VPN and apps and Wi-Fi.When prompted to enter a name for the certificate, use Cardinal Key Root."

Network Access,Wireless Access for Stanford Visitors,"The information on this page applies only to the wireless network managed by Stanford University IT. Many schools and departments on campus also provide their own wireless networks.
Every day, Stanford hosts many visitors and guests who need wireless access. They include:
Prospective students and their familiesVendors attending meetings on campusAlumniConference attendees from other educational institutions
Three types of wireless access are available, depending upon who you are:
Stanford Visitor (short-term sessions; limited bandwidth; ports limited to email, web browsing, VPN, and SSH; not part of Stanford University IP space)Sponsored Guest (no restrictions based on ports; available for up to two weeks; requires a Stanford sponsor; part of Stanford University IP space)eduroam (for eduroam affiliates; requires an account at an institution that participates in eduroam)
Stanford Visitor wireless access
With the Stanford Visitor network, you can use the university's wireless network to access the Internet while on-campus. The Stanford Visitor network is intended for the average Stanford visitor — not visitors who need access to special applications.
The visitor network offers limited bandwidth, and sessions are limited to 12 hours. Services are limited to email, web browsing, VPN, and SSH, and visitors on this wireless network are not part of Stanford University IP space— meaning firewalls on campus may give you less access than if you use the Sponsored Guest wireless. 
How to get online
Select the SSID Stanford Visitor from your device's list of available wireless networks.Open a browser and load any URL; you will be redirected to an access page (on a mobile phone, the access page should open automatically).Click Accept to acknowledge the terms of use. Your browser will be sent to a confirmation page, and from there you can get online.
Sponsored Guest wireless access
If you use an application that has a unique set of ports or if you need to be part of the Stanford University IP space, you may want to consider using the Sponsored Guest wireless network.
You will first need a current Stanford faculty member, staff member, or student to sponsor a wireless guest account for you.
To sponsor a guest, visit wirelessguest.stanford.edu to establish a SUNet ID-sponsored guest account. This includes selecting a user name and a password for the guest account.
The length of the sponsorship ranges from one to 14 days. If your guests visit for more than two weeks, they will need a new guest account. University IT tracks guest accounts to the sponsoring SUNet ID.
How to get online
To access sponsored wireless guest service:
Open a browser and load any URL to display a Stanford WebLogin page.Log in with your sponsored guest user name and password. After you log in, you can use Internet services and web browsing as you would at a public venue such as Starbucks.
Note: As a Stanford guest account sponsor, you are responsible for your guests' Internet use as well as any reported misuse.
eduroam wireless access
This secure, worldwide service allows students, researchers, and staff from other institutions that also use eduroam to connect to the network by supplying the login credentials of their home organization.   
How to get online
Note: When connecting to eduroam from an off-campus location, you should accept the radius-cert.stanford.edu and authenticate your device, if prompted.
To use the eduroam service in its initial implementation on campus:
Select the SSID eduroam from your device's list of available wireless networks.Enter your user name at the prompt, in the format <SUNetID>@stanford.edu and your SUNet password.Accept the eduroam certificate and authenticate your device, if prompted.

Network Access,Connecting to Stanford’s Wired Network with Windows 10,"Your computer needs a unique Internet address in order for it to work on Stanford's computer network (SUNet). To get a valid Internet address assigned to your computer, you need to configure the TCP/IP protocol and determine your Ethernet hardware address (also known as a MAC address). Then, you must register your Ethernet hardware address for on-campus use in order for your computer to operate on SUNet.
Note: You must be logged on as an administrator or a member of the Administrators group in order to complete this procedure.
Determining your physical hardware address (MAC address)
Method 1: The easiest method for obtaining the MAC address of your Windows computer is using the Command Prompt.

Open the Command Prompt. Search, “Command Prompt” in the taskbar, or if you have an older version of Windows you can right-click on the Start button and select Command Prompt from the menu.


At the C:\ prompt type, ipconfig /all and press enter. This will display your network configuration. 
 

Find your adapter's Physical Address. Scroll down to your network adapter and look for the values next to “Physical Address”. That is your MAC address.​

Method 2: How to find your MAC address in Network Connection Settings.
You can also find the MAC address by looking at the details of your network adapter. 

Search “View network status and tasks” in the taskbar and select it. (Or navigate to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Sharing Center). 


Click on your network connection. 
Click the Details button. 
Locate the Physical address. The value for the physical address in the Network Connection Details window is your MAC address. ​

Device Security,Back Up Your Encryption Recovery Key (Mac),"If your computer is encrypted and you forget the password that unlocks your hard drive, you'll need the encryption recovery key to unlock your drive. In most cases, Stanford users have their recovery keys backed up in a secure database by the university. The recovery key  can then be retrieved in MyDevices.
Due to a bug that has now been fixed, some recovery keys that were saved using the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) service cannot be retrieved in MyDevices. You can check to see if any device belonging to you has a key available for retrieval in MyDevices.
If your device is encrypted but your encryption recovery key cannot be retrieved in MyDevices, you can use the Key Escrow Tool to fix the problem. 
Get the Key Escrow Tool
There are two ways to get the tool: you can download it on demand or it may deployed automatically to your computer via BigFix.
Method #1 — Download the Key Escrow Tool installer
You can download and run the installer yourself.

Download and run the Key Escrow Tool installer

Method #2 — Deployed automatically via BigFix
If you need to run the Key Escrow Tool, it will be delivered to your computer via BigFix. You will be notified in advance that this is going to happen.

When the tool is deployed to your computer you will see an alert in the upper-right corner of your screen. You must click one of the buttons to continue.

Click Start to continue to download and run the Key Escrow Tool.
Click Defer to defer the deployment for 24 hours.

 
If you clicked Start, another screen displays. Click OK .If you click Defer the program will launch again in one day. If you click Cancel the program will not automatically launch again. 

Install the tool
Note: If you are running a  version of macOS prior to 10.9.5 the installation process will be slightly different. See the Missing Encryption Recovery Keys FAQ for more information. 

Regardless of whether the installer is launched via BigFix or on demand, the Welcome screen displays. Click Continue.
Select your hard drive as the disk where you want to install the software and then click Continue
Click Install to begin the installation.
When prompted, enter your local administrator account name and password for the Mac and click Install Software.Note: If you are prompted for a password that you don't know, please contact your local IT support, submit a Help ticket or call the IT Service Desk at (650) 725-HELP (5-4357).
Click Yes, Escrow My Recovery Key to save your encryption recovery key in a secure database.If your recovery key is already saved, you will have the option to generate and save a new one.​
At the prompt, enter your local computer password for the Mac and then click Unlock.
Your encryption recovery key displays. Write this down and store it in a secure location if you wish and then click Close.
After the installation has completed, click Close to exit the setup wizard.
To verify that your device's key has successfully been escrowed,  check its Device Details page in MyDevices. Note that there can be a delay of up to eight hours between the time you run the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool and the time the key can be retrieved in MyDevices."
Device Security,What should I do if my operating system doesn't support encryption?,You should upgrade to an operating system that supports BitLocker or FileVault 2 encryption. See Encrypt Your Devices for more information. Submit a Help ticket for assistance.
Device Security,Stanford Mobile Device Management (MDM) Configuration Profiles (iOS/iPadOS),"MDM (Mobile Device Management) applies a profile that can:

Add a passcode or password to your device.
Remotely lock your device if you lose it — a benefit from using a passcode/password with your device.
Enable you to wipe data from your device if it's lost or stolen.
Configure Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
Configure email, contacts, and calendar to your device.
Detect whether a device has been jailbroken or rooted.
Automatically block intruders who enter more than 10 failed passcode/password attempts. (Note: reaching the 10th attempt takes two hours.)

Mail
Why use MDM (managed) email?
You might already have Stanford email, calendar, and contact information on your device. If you replace your existing accounts with the managed account provided by MDM, you can benefit in these ways:

Easy removal: The managed account can be removed remotely if your device is lost or stolen, or if you leave Stanford. In contrast, a manually configured account can't be removed without wiping the entire device.
Better battery life: Managed email and calendar settings are optimized by reducing the number of hits to the server, thus putting less drain on your device's battery.

Duplicate accounts
If you already have Stanford Email and Calendar on your device when you enroll in the MDM program — but you want to install managed mail — delete your old account before you add the managed account to avoid duplicate emails and appointments. Deleting your account will not delete your messages and appointments from the server. They will be safely reinstalled through the MDM enrollment process.
To delete an account on your iOS device:

Tap Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar.
From the list of accounts, tap the one you want to delete.
Tap Delete Account (the red button) at the bottom of the page.You will see a prompt that says ""Deleting this account will remove its data from your iPhone/iPad.""
Tap Delete Account.

To delete an account on your Android device:
Note: Each Adroid device may be slightly different.

Tap Settings > Email.
Tap Manage Accounts.
Press and hold the name of your Stanford email account — typically Exchange or ActiveSync for Stanford accounts.
Tap Remove.

What to expect — installing MDM mail
When you include MDM mail during your enrollment, you'll see a lot of activity for a few minutes on your device. All your messages need to download and your appointments need to sync to your calendar. This is normal. In a few minutes, you'll have your messages and appointments on your device.
Passcode/password lock
The MDM sets up your device to require a passcode or password after a certain period of inactivity (Auto-Lock), or for a ""grace period"" after you press the On/Off button on the device. It enables these settings with a maximum amount of time allowed for each of these functions.
When you install the MDM, the factory default settings are activated. MDM permits you to increase these values up to the maximum defined in the table below. Change the settings here:

Auto-Lock (for inactivity) — iOS: Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock ; Android: Settings > Security >Lock screen (varies slightly from phone to phone)
Require Passcode (for grace period after lock) — iOS: Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Require Passcode; Android: Settings > Security > Lock screen  > Screen lock




Feature
Default setting
MDM maximum time allowed




Auto-Lock
iPhone: 1 minuteiPad: 2 minutesAndroid: varies by model, OS, and carrier

Passcode expiration
MDM sets a passcode expiration policy of two years. If you set a passcode prior to enrolling in MDM, the expiration occurs when the passcode age reaches the two year mark — not two years after enrolling in MDM. The new passcode cannot be the same as the old passcode.
Your personal settings and other profiles
If you already have configuration profiles or personal settings on your device that might cause conflict with the MDM, your results may be as follows:
Passcode length: if your passcode is longer than the length by Stanford MDM, your longer passcode will be retained after you enroll in MDM.
Auto-lock: MDM allows Auto-Lock settings up to 5 minutes. If your device is set to Never, or to < 5 minutes before you enroll in MDM, your results may vary. If possible, turn off your existing Auto-Lock and Passcode Lock settings before you install MDM. After you enroll, you can choose Auto-Lock settings of up to 5 minutes and your Passcode Lock will be set to 1 minute, which you can reset to Immediately if you prefer."
Device Security,Device Enrollment: Enroll a Mac,"The Device Enrollment app presents you with a brief questionnaire. Stanford needs to gather some information about  your computer to ensure it meets security standards.  Enrollment also associates a computer with the person who is responsible for its data security in MyDevices. Depending on the information you store on your computer, you may need to encrypt your hard drive.

Yes: You work with or could receive High Risk Data such as Protected Health Information (PHI), credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc. See the Risk Classifications page for more information about High Risk Data.No: You do not work with and could not receive High Risk Data."
Device Security,Why is my device reported to be unencrypted when I'm sure it's encrypted?,"BigFix might not be checking in, or only partially checking in.
Go to mydevices.stanford.edu  and then click the link in the Model column to display the Device Details page of the non-compliant device. In the Device Information section, under Encryption Status,  the ""Last checked"" date might be too far in the past.  The difference between the ""Last checked"" date and the  ""Last Seen on Network"" date in the Miscellaneous Information section should be no more than 7 days."
Device Security,What can an IT professional do if a user's device is reported to be partially encrypted?,"If a device has multiple fixed disks, all of them are required to be encrypted; and if at least one is, while one or more is not, the device might be reported to be partially encrypted.
Mac OS devices in BigFix that have multiple unencrypted disks are reported to be partially encrypted, and at some point in the future the same will hold for Windows devices as well. Administrators can access BigFix web reports that list all such devices (that have BigFix installed on them) in their areas: ""[STANFORD] Mac OS Multiple Unencrypted Disks"" and ""[STANFORD] Windows Multiple Unencrypted Disks"".
IMPORTANT: Currently we can only escrow recovery keys for the system volume.
See the information about encrypting multiple disks."
Device Security,Mobile Device Management (MDM) Privacy Information,"Workspace ONE (Android) and Jamf (iOS/iPadOS) mobile device management (MDM) enforce and periodically report on your device's configuration to ensure alignment with the Minimum Security Standards.
Stanford University respects your privacy, and MDM cannot access your application data, call history, voicemail, or SMS messages on your mobile device. We cannot and do not collect your personal data, and while the capability exists, we do not collect GPS location information. Here's what information we collect and why:

Device and network ID, and information on storage capacity, operating system, carrier, and firmware (to uniquely identify your device in MyDevices and to ensure that we're looking at the correct records if it’s lost or stolen).
List of apps installed by MDM, not including your personal apps (needed by MDM to confirm whether apps provided by Stanford have been installed). MDM can list all installed apps, but we have explicitly disabled that capability.
Jailbreak or root detection (indicates whether built-in security features have been bypassed. Jailbreak or root detection informs you if these features have been disabled).

Here's what permissions are requested and why:

Add/remove accounts (to set up Stanford Email and Calendar, if you opt-in).
Add/remove restrictions (to establish minimum security standards, such as requiring a device passcode and auto screen lock).
Remotely erase Stanford data (if you leave the University or lose your device). The capability exists to wipe your phone fully, but the university will never do this on your behalf.

The collected data is considered Moderate Risk data in the University's risk classification system.
See the Administrative Guide for Stanford's official policy regarding privacy. If you have any questions about this policy, please submit a Help ticket.
For each device, we store the following:

Name
UDID (Unique Device Identifier)
Wi-Fi MAC address
Phone number
Cellular technology
Cellular network ID
Model
Model name
SIM carrier
Last carrier
Serial number
Carrier settings version
Modem firmware version
Capacity
Jailbreak or root status

We also store the time of enrollment in the service and the time of each access to the service by your mobile device."
Device Security,What are the information security requirements for removable media?,"At this time, removable storage devices (e.g., USB hard drives, USB flash memory) are exempt from encryption requirements. Nonetheless, if a device is being used to store (e.g., to back up) High Risk Data, every effort should be made to encrypt it, and to keep it physically secure."
Device Security,What happens if a device is not compliant with the security requirements?,"If you have a non-compliant device, you are notified via email that you must take action. The email specifies the steps you need to take to make the device compliant and you have a 30-day grace period to take action. You'll receive weekly reminders listing the non-compliant device and the remaining grace period days. If after 30 days from receipt of the first notification a device is still non-compliant, it is blocked from accessing the Stanford network till it is made compliant.
If you are using a Mac that is encrypted but MyDevices is reporting that it is not encrypted, see the FAQ for determining Mac encryption status and troubleshooting tips.
MyDevices provides a historical log of all notifications that have been sent regarding a specific device.

Device Security,How to Install Stanford Whole Disk Encryption for Mac,"Overview
When you run the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) installer, the first step is Stanford's Device Enrollment app, a brief questionnaire that gathers basic information about your computer. If you already have responded to these questions, your previous answers are displayed.
After you complete the questionnaire, SWDE steps you through the process of encrypting your hard drive. The installer checks your computer to make sure certain requirements are met, such as having BigFix software installed. You will need to fix, or let the installer fix, any items that are flagged before continuing.
Once your computer has been authorized to install encryption, you are prompted to enable FileVault 2, Apple's built-in encryption technology, to encrypt the whole disk.
Notes:
Mac OS X 10.9 and above provide an interface to manage FileVault 2 that allows for the automation of storing recovery information for the encrypted drive.For machines running  OS X 10.7 and 10.8, you'll need to manually turn on FileVault and run a tool to escrow your recovery key. See the manual activation instructions for assistance with the process.Boot Camp: FileVault 2 does not encrypt the Windows partition on systems running Boot Camp. Therefore, SWDE-compliant machines cannot run Boot Camp.  OS X users needing to run Windows need to use VMware Fusion or Parallels.
Download software
System requirements
Operating System: Mac OS X 10.9 and above is required.

You are strongly encouraged to back up your files before starting to encrypt. CrashPlan, provided by University IT, is the recommended backup service, but your local IT group may provide other options. CrashPlan encrypts your backups for secure storage and also provides the option of setting a secondary password to ensure that only you can restore the files.
Before starting the encryption, make sure your computer is on AC power and has an active network connection.Depending on the size and speed of your hard drive and how many files are stored there, encryption can take from 45 minutes to two days.You may want to install the software at the end of the day and let the encryption run overnight. You can use your computer during the encryption process, but certain activities may be noticeably slower.

Device Security,How to Install Stanford Whole Disk Encryption for Windows,"Overview
When you run the SWDE installer, the first step is Stanford's Device Enrollment app, a brief questionnaire which gathers basic information about your computer. If you already have responded to these questions, your previous answers are displayed.
After you complete the questionnaire SWDE steps you through the process of encrypting your hard drive. It checks your computer to make sure certain requirements are met, such as having BigFix software installed. You will need to fix, or let the installer fix, any items that are flagged before continuing.
Once your computer has been authorized to install encryption, the installer attempts to enable BitLocker,  Windows built-in encryption technology, to encrypt the whole disk. If BitLocker cannot be enabled automatically, a browser opens and displays the instructions for manually enabling BitLocker.

System requirements

Operating System: Windows 7 (Enterprise or Ultimate), Windows 8/8.1 (Professional or Enterprise), Windows 10 (Professional, Enterprise, or Education)
Windows 8.0 and below: The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or higher must be installed. It must also be enabled and activated (or turned on).


You are strongly encouraged to back up your files before starting to encrypt. CrashPlan PROe provided by University IT is the recommended backup service, but your local IT group may provide other options. CrashPlan encrypts your backups for secure storage and also provides the option of setting a secondary password to ensure that only you can restore the files.

Before starting the encryption, make sure your computer is on AC power and has an active network connection.
Depending on the size and speed of your hard drive and how many files are stored there, encryption can take from 45 minutes to two days.
You may want to install the the software at the end of the day and let the encryption run over night. You can use your computer during the encryption process, but certain activities may be noticeably slower.

Device Security,How to Resolve the AMIE Email Verification Loop,"Issue
When completing the initial Data and Device Attestation, new users may get stuck in an email verification loop. Users will receive the email with the verification code and link but will be unable to open the link and continue. Instead, clicking the link will prompt the user to generate the link again and will not provide a place to enter the verification code.
Resolution
The issue is resolved by opening the link in either a different browser or a private/incognito window. The issue will also resolve itself if enough time has passed that the user needs to sign into AMIE again.
Note
It has been found that this workaround did not work on a Linux system on eduroam, but the issue was resolved when the same machine was connected to a different network."
Device Security,What are the ways to update a user's Device Enrollment answers?,"The user can manually run the Device Enrollment app to update existing answers. 
If BigFix is installed, you can delete the enrollment.txt file on the endpoint system to force re-enrollment. The file locations are:

Windows 7 and above: \ProgramData\Stanford\enrollment.txtMac OS: /Library/Application Support/Stanford/enrollment.txt


A BigFix administrator can use the ""[STANFORD][SWDE] Delete Enrollment Answers"" fixlet, which can selectively delete existing user enrollment answers on both Windows and Mac OS devices. Non-expiring actions targeting all Stanford BigFix clients will then prompt users to enroll or re-enroll, until someone self-identifies as the primary user.

The fixlet provides three possible actions:


Delete primary user enrollment answers only. Each new local user who has not previously provided any enrollment answers will be prompted to enroll. Answers from non-primary users will be preserved, and those users will not be prompted to re-enroll.
Delete all user enrollment answers. All local users will be prompted to enroll or re-enroll at their next logon. Use this action if existing non-primary users might need to be promoted to primary, or to start from scratch for any reason.
Delete enrollment answers for a specific SUNet ID. Enrollment answers for the specified SUNet ID will be deleted whether or not that user is identified as primary. If this action deletes a primary user, new local users will be prompted to enroll until a new primary user self-identifies.

Device Security,Why is my device reported to be partially encrypted?,"If a device has multiple fixed disks, all of them are required to be encrypted. If at least one is encrypted, while one or more is not, the device might be reported to be partially encrypted."
Device Security,Why is my encrypted Mac reporting that it is not encrypted in MyDevices?,"There are three likely reasons that an encrypted Mac would indicate that it is unencrypted in My Devices:
The system was encrypted but has not been rebooted since the encryption was completed. If you suspect this may be the case, reboot before proceeding. FileVault has been enabled but encryption is not yet complete. On large traditional hard drives the time to complete encryption can run many hours, increasing with the size of the drive. Also, encryption of APFS-formatted SSD drives takes longer than encryption on HFS+-formatted SSD drives. FileVault is on and the boot volume is encrypted but additional volumes have been created that are not encrypted.
How to determine if your Mac is encrypted: hard drives with one partition/volume
To confirm the encryption status of your Mac, navigate to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault.
If your hard drive is encrypted, the FileVault displays a message saying that FileVault is turned on. If your had drive is not encrypted, the FileVault screen displays a message saying that FileVault is turned off. If your hard drive is in the process of being encrypted, the FileVault screen displays the encryption status.
How to determine if your Mac is encrypted: hard drives with multiple partitions/volumes
Navigating to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault reveals the status of the system partition but not any additional partitions. To find the status of additional partitions or volumes:
Navigate to Applications > Utilities and launch Disk Utility app.In the left panel, click the extra partition or volume and then click Info in the upper-right corner of the toolbar.Information about the selected volume displays. Find the Is encrypted line and confirm that is says Yes. You may have to expand the window to display all the information.Check the encryption status for each additional partition or volume.If the encryption status of any volume or partition is No, launch Finder. In the dock, click the Finder icon and then in the left panel under Devices, click your computer name.In the right panel, CONTROL + click the icon of the additional partition or volume. Find the menu item labeled Encrypt <volume name> where <volume name> is the name of the partition or volume. This will encrypt the partition.When the encryption is completed, the Encrypt menu item changes to Decrypt <volume name>.
Get encryption status using command line tools
Get encryption status for system partition
To get the system partition status launch Terminal.app and run the following command:
/usr/bin/fdesetup status
If the system partition is encrypted the status returned is: FileVault is OnIf the system partition is not encrypted the status returned is: FileVault is OffIf the system partition is currently being encrypted the status returned is: FileVault is On. Encryption in progress: Percent completed = XX
Get encryption status for additional partitions or volumes
To get encryption status for additional partitions/volumes launch Terminal.app and run the following command:
/usr/sbin/diskutil list
 Run the following command to get the encryption status of a particular volume. (In this example the volume is named ""Test."")
 /usr/sbin/diskutil cs info /Volumes/Test
Note: This command returns a list of core storage properties, which includes encryption status.

If ""Test"" is encrypted, the core storage properties show Conversion State: Complete and LV Conversion Progress: 100%. If ""Test"" is not encrypted, the core storage properties return a message saying that ""Test"" is not a CoreStorage disk. If ""Test"" is in the process of being encrypted the core storage properties show Conversion State: Converting and LV Conversion Progress: the percent of encryption completed.

Answers to frequently asked questions
What is the problem?
Some encryption recovery keys for macOS and Windows computers that were backed up using the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption service are not available for retrieval in MyDevices, although they should be. Correcting the problem will in many cases require action on the part of affected users.
What is an encryption recovery key and why is it important?
If you're ever locked out of an encrypted macOS or Windows computer, e.g., because you've forgotten the necessary password, you will need an encryption recovery key to unlock it. In most cases, Stanford users should have their keys securely backed up by University IT (also known as ""key escrow""), so that they can be retrieved in MyDevices.
Note that VLRE users, during installation of the VLRE software, can choose not to escrow their recovery keys, although it's strongly recommended that they do so.
Who is affected by the missing recovery key problem?
Anyone who encrypted a macOS or Windows computer using Stanford-provided software (i.e., SWDE or VLRE) could find that the encryption recovery key for that computer isn't retrievable in MyDevices. Mobile devices are not affected.
Will device compliance be affected by this problem?
No. It is not required that a device's encryption recovery key be backed up in MyDevices for the device to be compliant.
What should I do to correct this problem?
You can first check to see if any device belonging to you does not have a key available for retrieval in MyDevices. If you find a device for which a key should be available but is not, you can fix the problem by downloading and running the Key Escrow Tool for Mac or the Key Escrow Tool for Windows. The tool must be run on each device whose key is missing.
In some cases you might see an alert that will appear on your affected macOS devices' desktops requesting that you run the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool. The tool would then be delivered automatically using BigFix. BigFix is required for devices subject to Stanford's compliance rules, if those devices are not using VLRE.

You can verify that a device's key has successfully been escrowed by checking its Device Details page in MyDevices, bearing in mind that there will be a delay of up to 8 hours between the time you run the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool and the time the key can be retrieved in MyDevices.
How can I tell if a device's recovery key is in MyDevices?
You can tell whether a particular device has a recovery key available for retrieval by looking in MyDevices. For each device, check the Device Details page by clicking the Model name. The Encryption Status line will state ""Encryption key not available for the device"" if there's no key in escrow, and otherwise you'll see a link to retrieve the key.

Users who have one or more devices with missing recovery keys will also see an announcement on their MyDevices main page listing the names of the affected devices. Clicking on a device name will bring up its Details page.

Will affected users be notified?
Yes. Starting on April 20, 2017 there will be an announcement displayed on the MyDevices main page for affected users, which will list each device for which a key is missing. There will be broad outreach to the university's technical support community. Eventually affected users who have not already taken action may be notified directly by e-mail.
What caused the missing recovery key problem in MyDevices?
A bug in the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) desktop application for macOS and Windows, which was fixed in December 2016, was sometimes causing recovery keys not to be stored in MyDevices.
The problem at first was only apparent when someone tried to retrieve a key. Now there's a clear indication in MyDevices that a given device's recovery key is or is not available for retrieval.
What is key escrow?
Key escrow is secure storage by Stanford University IT of encryption recovery keys for specific devices, so that they may be retrieved from MyDevices when needed. Only the person whose device's key is in escrow can retrieve the key, absent extraordinary circumstances. Recovery keys are stored in encrypted form.
What happens if I use VLRE and choose not to escrow a key?
You will need to save your encryption recovery key by some other means, such as writing it down on a piece of paper that's stored in a secure location that's reliably accessible to you. You can also escrow keys with other services, such as that provided by Apple for macOS devices.
What if I'm running a version of macOS prior to 10.9.5?
For versions of macOS prior to 10.9.5, you will either have to enter the device's existing recovery key manually in the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool, assuming you have the key, or else you'll have to decrypt and re-encrypt the device using SWDE. The software will guide you through the process.
What if I'm prompted for a password I don't have?
If the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool prompts you for an administrator password that you don't have, you will probably need to get assistance from your local technical support group.
What if MyDevices shows there's a missing key, but the Key Escrow Tool shows there's not?
In some cases MyDevices might report that a device's encryption recovery key is missing, but when you run the Key Escrow Tool on that device, the tool will report that the key is already backed up. In this situation the information in MyDevices may be incorrect, so if possible you should wait a day and look in MyDevices once again.
If the key still appears to be missing, you can use the Key Escrow Tool to create a new recovery key. If you create a new key, it should appear in MyDevices within 12 hours. If you need help, please contact IT support.
What if I need help?
If you need further assistance, please contact your local IT support, submit a Help ticket, or call 725-HELP (5-4357)."
Device Security,How to Encrypt Disk Partitions on macOS,"In order for devices to be fully compliant—as defined in the Information Security Office (ISO) standards—all internal partitions must be encrypted. The initial SWDE (Stanford Whole Disk Encryption) enrollment procedure only encrypts the “system” partition in multi-partition Macs. All internal, non-system partitions are encrypted manually from within Finder.

Launch Finder and select the non-system partition. Right-click (or CTRL + click) the partition name and select Encrypt <partition name>.
Create an encryption password. This can be any password you choose but don’t forget it. It will be required the next time you login to the Mac. Then, click Encrypt Disk.
When encryption is complete the menu item will change to Decrypt <partition name>.
The next time you reboot your Mac or log in you will be prompted to enter your encryption password to unlock the encrypted volume. This happens every reboot or login unless the password is saved in the keychain."

Download VLREEnrollEncrypt with VLRESelf EncryptionUpdate NoticeHelp
When you run the VLRE installer, you are presented with Stanford's Device Enrollment app, a brief questionnaire that gathers basic information about your computer. If you previously responded to these questions, your answers are displayed and you can change them if you wish.
After you complete the questionnaire:
If your computer was encrypted using the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption service (SWDE) no further action is required.If your computer is not encrypted, VLRE steps you through the process of encrypting your hard drive. You are prompted to enable FileVault 2, Apple's built-in encryption technology, to encrypt the whole disk.If you self-encrypted your computer by turning on FileVault 2,  you are presented with an option to have your recovery key escrowed in a secure database. This option is highly recommended because it allows you to use the MyDevices service to recover your encryption key. If you forget your password you need your recovery key to access your computer. If you don't have your recovery key, your data is permanently lost.

Device enrollment questionnaire
Run the VLRE  installer.When the Install VLRE screen displays, click Continue. A setup wizard guides you through the steps necessary to install the software.First, the Device Enrollment app runs, asking a series of questions regarding the use of this computer for Stanford business. If you have already answered these questions, please review the answers and make any necessary corrections. Click Proceed Now.Next, choose whether or not you have a valid SUNet ID and then click Continue.If you have a valid SUNet ID:
Enter your SUNet ID and password on the Login screen.​You will be asked to answer some questions about this device and the types of data that is accessed and stored on it.
If you do not have a valid SUNet ID:
If you are no longer affiliated with Stanford, the questionnaire is terminated.If  this computer is used for Stanford work, the questionnaire is terminated. Someone with a valid SUNet ID needs to complete the questionnaire.

Encrypt with VLRE
If you need to encrypt your computer, VLRE steps you through the encryption process after the questionnaire is completed.
Before you begin
Note: You are encouraged to contact your local support organization to make sure your system is being routinely backed up prior to encrypting.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you back up your computer or data before you start encrypting. If the disk encryption process encounters a disk error, data loss or corruption could occur. CrashPlan provided by University IT is the recommended backup service and is widely used within Stanford, but your local IT group may provide other options.

Before starting the encryption, make sure your computer is on AC power and has an active network connection.Depending on the size and speed of your hard drive and how many files are stored there, encryption can take from 45 minutes to two days. You may want to install the the software at the end of the day and let the encryption run over night. You can use your computer during the encryption process, but certain activities may be noticeably slower.Note regarding Boot Camp: FileVault 2 does not encrypt the Windows partition on systems running Boot Camp.  Therefore,  to be compliant machines cannot run Boot Camp.  OS X users needing to run Windows need to use VMware Fusion or Parallels.
VLRE can log the program activity to a local file that technical support staff can use for troubleshooting. Click Yes to enable logging (recommended) or No to not enable logging.
Click OK to begin whole disk encryption.
Encrypt
You  are given the option to escrow your encryption recovery key in a secure database. Selecting Yes is highly recommended because it allows you to use the MyDevices service to recover your encryption key. Click Next to continue.The next screen describes what to expect. If you are ready to encrypt your hard drive, check I have a backup and understand the risks involved and wish to continue and then click Continue. (If your computer is already encrypted this screen does not display.)When the Welcome screen is displayed, click Continue.Next, a policy agreement is displayed. Read it and click Agree to accept the terms of the policy agreement and continue with the installation.Click Configure to enable FielVault2.If your are running macOS 10.12 and below, you will see a message saying that you need to restart your computer after FileVault2 is installed. Click Yes.Enter your administrator account name and password and then click Unlock.Your recovery key is displayed. You will need this to unlock your FileVault 2 encryption if you forget your computer password. Make a copy of the recovery key and store it in a safe place. Then, click Close.macOS 10.13 and above users: Click OK to start encrypting.macOS 10.12 and below users: You need to restart your computer and complete the FileVault2 configuration.After your computer restarts, enter your account password.A window displays the encryption status.Note: You can use your computer while it is being encrypted.
Self encryption
If you encrypted your computer using FileVault 2 without using Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE), you are responsible for managing the recovery key.
After completing the questionnaire you are presented with an option to have the recovery key escrowed in a secure database. This option is highly recommended because if you lose or forget your recovery key, your encrypted data will be irretrievable.
If you opt to have your recovery key escrowed:
Mac OS X 10.9.5 and above: a new recovery key is generated and then escrowed.Below Mac OS X 10.9.5: a dialog box prompts you to enter your recovery key.
Update notice
A message will pop up on your computer screen when a new version of VLRE is available. You should install the latest version of VLRE to maintain device compliance.

Device Security,Who is covered by Stanford's computer security mandate?,"All active Stanford University faculty and staff are subject to the security mandate requiring encryption. Anyone who handles High Risk Data is likewise covered by the mandate, including student employees. Some university schools, departments, or organizations might impose more stringent requirements.

Device Security,Who should be listed as the primary user during device enrollment?,"The primary user is the person responsible for a device's security and maintenance. In many cases this is unambiguously the person who is the sole user of a device, but sometimes it will be a system administrator, or one user in a collection of occasional users.
It is necessary to specify a primary user's SUNet ID during device enrollment in order for a device to be associated with that user in MyDevices. A Mac OS or Windows device can have any number of secondary users, whose enrollment answers are saved, but ignored for compliance purposes."
Device Security,Rooting Information for Android Devices,"What is rooting?
Rooting is the process of gaining privileged access, known as root access, to your device's operating system. With root access you are able to use device features that may be locked or disabled, add custom themes and settings, and replace the operating system with another version.
Why does it matter if a phone is rooted?
Rooting is often performed with the goal of overcoming limitations that carriers and hardware manufacturers put on some devices. However, there are many downsides to rooting a device:

Almost all manufacturers' warranties become void once you root your device.
If the process is not done correctly, your device could become permanently unusable.
Malware can have direct access to the device's operating system, bypassing all the safety measures that are in place.
Firmware and software updates from your wireless carrier may not be able to be installed.

Some of you work with data that Stanford categorizes as Moderate or High Risk. If you work with High Risk Data, you must use a device that offers hardware encryption, that has not been rooted, and that employs the security settings and features that can be automatically configured for you by MDM.
Root detection
Stanford can determine through its network services whether or not your device was rooted. MDM notifies you of this status because:

You must unroot your device to remain in compliance with the requirements of Stanford MDM.
You might not know that the data on your device is at risk — for example, your banking apps, your Facebook account, and anything else that requires a secure login.

How to unroot your device
There is no clear recommendation on what to do once a device is rooted because unrooting varies by device. For some devices, restoring your device to the factory settings is effective. However, this resets all settings and deletes all data on your device. We recommend contacting the person who rooted your device regarding the process for unrooting it. You could also search the web for unrooting instructions for your device.
Even if you are able to successfully “unroot” your device, many Android device vendors embed a feature that will forever indicate a device is rooted my MDM systems such as AirWatch. Be aware of this when making the decision to root your device.
Rooted devices cannot comply with the requirements for Stanford University Mobile Device Management. If you need assistance unenrolling your device in MDM, please submit a Help ticket."
Device Security,Jailbreaking Information for iOS Devices,"What is jailbreaking?
Jailbreaking unlocks the security settings on your device so that you have admin control over it. After it's jailbroken, others could potentially have admin control over it, too. On an Android device, this same process is called ""rooting.""
Sometimes people jailbreak their devices intentionally — for example, to change the SIM card when they travel abroad, or to use the device with a different carrier. Other times they might not know their device is jailbroken — they might have visited a website or downloaded a document that altered the device's settings.
Why does it matter if a phone is jailbroken?
When an iOS device is jailbroken, its built-in security features are compromised. For example, by design, iOS ""sandboxes"" its applications so that data from one app can't be read or altered by another one. When you jailbreak your phone, you're vulnerable to hackers who could steal your passwords and data, or install malware on your device.
In addition, you won't receive software updates and security patches if your device is jailbroken.
Some of you work with data that Stanford categorizes as Moderate or High Risk. If you work with High Risk Data, you must use a device that offers hardware encryption, that has not been jailbroken, and that employs the security settings and features that can be automatically configured for you by MDM.
Jailbreak detection
Stanford can determine through its network services whether or not your device was jailbroken. MDM notifies you of this status because:

You may need to un-jailbreak your phone to remain in compliance with the requirements of your job.
You might not know that the data on your device is at risk — for example, your banking apps, your Facebook account, and anything else that requires a secure login.

How to un-jailbreak your device

Connect your iOS device to iTunes.
In the left sidebar in iTunes, select your device.
Click the Summary tab in the main window, then click the Restore button.
Click Back Up when you see a pop-up message that asks if you want to back up your device, then click Restore again. Your device will first be returned to factory default settings before restoring it.
Wait while iTunes goes through the backup process and until you see the iPhone is activated message.
Click Restore from Backup...to restore your apps, music, and data back onto the phone. Any jailbroken apps won't be transferred back to the device."
Device Security,Why are devices that don't belong to me showing up in MyDevices?,"If a device that once belonged to you is being used by someone else at Stanford, it will continue to appear in your MyDevices until the new user runs the Enrollment Application to change the primary user SUNet ID.
You can remove the device from your MyDevices record by going to mydevices.stanford.edu and clicking the Remove button associated with the device."
Device Security,Mobile Device Compliance Checks in MyDevices,"Your device needs to check in regularly to ensure that appropriate security controls are in place. You can see when your device last checked in to Stanford MDM in the Management System Information section of the Device Details page for your device.
A device that hasn't checked in for a while might:

Be turned off or inoperable.
Be lost or stolen.
Have uninstalled the AirWatch app.
Have forced the AirWatch app to quit.

If your device has not checked in for over two weeks and is in your possession, turn the device on and open the AirWatch app. Tap on your device in the Status section and tap the Send Data button. If you've lost your device, see the Manage Your Lost Device page for more information.
iOS compliance checks
iOS — Has your device reported that it is not jailbroken?
The MDM service checks your device to make sure it isn't jailbroken. Jailbreaking compromises its built-in security features.
If your device has been jailbroken, you can fix it by following the ""How to Un-Jailbreak Your Phone"" instructions on the Jailbreaking Information page.
iOS — Are you running iOS 9.3.5 or higher?
Older versions of iOS have known vulnerabilities.
You should run the current version of iOS on your device to get the full benefit of security features and software patches.
iOS — is the AirWatch app installed?
If you don't have this app installed, please download it again from iTunes or the App Store. Launch the app, tap your device, and then tap the Send Data button to update your status.
The app must remain running in the background. It remains inactive save for sending a signal once a day to update your check-in status. Please do not force the app to quit.
Android compliance checks
Android — has your device reported that it has not been rooted?
The MDM service checks your device to make sure it isn't rooted. Rooting compromises its built-in security features. If you need assistance with unrooting your device, please submit a Help ticket. 
Android — is your device encrypted?
Your device must be encrypted. If it has not yet been encrypted, you will see a red alert.
To encrypt your device, it must have a password with a minimum of four digits, be plugged in, and be charged to 80%. Once you begin the encryption process, it may take up to two hours. Your phone must remain plugged in and will not receive phone calls or text messages during this period. It may also get hot. We recommend beginning the encryption process at bedtime. 
Android — does your device have a password?
Stanford University requires that you have a minimum of a four-character password. Face Unlock and Pattern security are not allowed. Some devices may have a stronger password requirement. 
To set a password, go to Settings > Security > Screen lock."
Device Security,Why aren't the changes I made reflected in MyDevices?,"MyDevices is only periodically updated throughout the day, and once updated, in some cases there has to be additional processing, which can take time. If a change isn't reflected after 24 hours for a device that's currently on the network, submit a Help ticket for assistance."
Device Security,What should I do if I remove a device from MyDevices by mistake?,"If you accidentally remove a device, please submit a Help ticket to have the device reinstated."
Device Security,What should an IT professional do if a user's changes are not reflected in MyDevices?,"If an end-user makes a change that isn't reflected in MyDevices after 24 hours for a device that's currently on the network, an IT professional can make changes to the NetDB node record:

Delete the existing node record, rather than editing it.
Wait for up to two hours to give the Device Registry time to receive notice of the deletion.
Create a new node record for the device.

If you don't follow this procedure, you might not get the results you want."
Device Security,What should I do if I see multiple entries for the same device in MyDevices?,"If you see multiple entries for the same device, please submit a Help ticket."
Device Security,What are the technical reasons why a device that doesn't belong to a user might show up in MyDevices?,"In some cases a device that once belonged to a user could appear in MyDevices if the SUNet ID is listed as a user in NetDB. The solution will be for an LNA to edit the NetDB record manually.
A less common but very confusing problem can arise if a network interface is passed around among different devices, as can happen with USB Ethernet adapters, laptop docking stations, some computer displays, and so on. In such a case these adapters are functioning like other network devices (e.g., a Wi-Fi router or Ethernet switch), and should be registered in NetDB as network devices with their own node record specifying an appropriate make and model. If devices like these are used solely with one computer, they should be registered as an interface of that computer."

Device Security,BitLocker Overview,"University IT recommends that you enable BitLocker with assistance from an IT support professional.

On this page:
overviewrequirementsenable BitLockerlog inchange PIN or print recovery keyturn off BitLocker

Overview
BitLocker Drive Encryption is a native security feature that encrypts everything on the drive that Windows is installed on. Device encryption helps protect your data by encrypting it. Only someone with the right encryption key (such as a personal identification number) can decrypt it.
BitLocker is used in conjunction with a hardware component called a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM is a smartcard-like module on the motherboard that is installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturer. BitLocker stores its recovery key in the TPM (version 1.2 or higher).
When you enable BitLocker, you create a personal identification number (PIN) that will be required to enter each time you start up your computer. While enabling BitLocker, a recovery key is generated. The recovery key is used to gain access to your computer should you forget your password. After the recovery key is generated you will be prompted to restart the machine. The encryption process begins when the computer reboots.
Note: You should print or save the recovery key and store it in a safe place apart from your computer.
Requirements
To use BitLocker, your computer must satisfy certain requirements:
Supported operating systems:
Windows 10 — Education, Pro, or Enterprise editionWindows 8 — Professional or Enterprise editionWindows 7 — Enterprise or Ultimate edition
For Windows 7, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or higher must be installed. It must also be enabled and activated (or turned on).
Additional requirements:
You must be logged in as an administrator.You must have access to a printer to print the recovery key.
Check your version of Windows
To find out the version of Windows you are running:
Click the Start button.In the Search box, type 'about your PC' winver.If the version displayed is not one of the versions listed above, BitLocker is not available on your computer.
Check your TPM status
If the TPM does not meet the system requirements listed above, the Encryption installer displays the TPM status at the point where you choose your encryption options.
Example of TPM status message::
Contact your local IT support if you want to enable BitLocker but need assistance with enabling and activating the TPM.
Enabling BitLocker
If your computer meets the Windows version and TPM requirements, the process for enabling BitLocker is as follows:
Click Start , click Control Panel, click System and Security (if the control panel items are listed by category), and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.Click Turn on BitLocker.BitLocker scans your computer to verify that it meets the system requirements.
If your computer meets the system requirements, the setup wizard continues with the BitLocker Startup Preferences in step 8.If preparations need to be made to your computer to turn on BitLocker, they are displayed. Click Next.
If prompted to do so, remove any CDs, DVDs, and USB flash drives from your computer and then click Shutdown.Turn your computer back on after shutdown. Follow the instructions in the message to continue initializing the TMP. (The message varies, depending on the computer manufacturer).If your computer shuts down again, turn it back on.The BitLocker setup wizard resumes atomically. Click Next.When the BitLocker startup preferences page is displayed, click Require a PIN at every startup.Enter a PIN from 8 to 20 characters long and then enter it again in the Confirm PIN field. Click Set PIN.Note: You will need to enter your PIN each time you start your computer.To store your recovery key, select Print the recovery key and then click Next.Note: Make sure your computer is connected to a printer.Print a copy of your recovery key.You will be prompted to restart your computer to start the encryption process. You can use your computer while your drive is being encrypted.
Logging in
Enabling BitLocker will change the way you log in to your system. You need to enter your PIN at every startup, prior to entering your password. This is designed to provide an additional layer of security for your data.
Changing your PIN or regenerating a copy of your recovery key
Once you have created your PIN, you can change it in the BitLocker Drive Encryption control panel You can also regenerate a new copy of your recovery key if you lose the printed copy.
Click Start , click Control Panel, click System and Security (if the control panel items are listed by category), and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.In the BitLocker Drive Encryption control panel, click Manage BitLocker.Follow the instructions on the screen.
Turning off BitLocker
If you want to decrypt your hard drive, all you need to do is turn off BitLocker. To turn off BitLocker you must be logged in as an administrator.
Click Start , click Control Panel, click System and Security (if the control panel items are listed by category), and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.In the BitLocker Drive Encryption control panel, click Turn Off BitLocker.Click Decrypt Drive to start the decryption process."
Device Security,What should I do if I don't see one of my devices in MyDevices?,"Check your network settings to make sure the device is on the network. If it is and you still don't see it in MyDevices, submit a Help ticket."
Device Security,Why is a user's Chromebook not being correctly identified in MyDevices?,"A network administrator can edit the NetDB node record so that the make and model are ""Samsung Chromebook"" and the operating system is ""Chrome OS""."
Device Security,What can an IT professional do if a user's device is not compliant?,"Sometimes users do everything they are supposed to do and a device is still listed as not compliant in MyDevices. If BigFix is installed but:
... the Windows 10 computer's MyDevices Encryption Status reports the device is not encrypted, there might be a problem with the VBScript that generates information locally on the Windows client for BigFix collection and reporting to MyDevices.
An end user or IT support person will have to take these steps:
Create a Scheduled Task to regularly run a script that updates the bitlockerinfo.txt file
Set up corrective bitlockerinfo.txt-updater script to run on a schedule. Batch script calls PowerShell script to address bug where a Bitlocker encyption status text file on rare occasion contains no field values. This state causes MyDevices to consider the computer non-compliant when it in fact may be BitLocker enabled and compliant. The schedule task manages this autonomously; but with the aid of a run-as-admin-shortcut to the ""run-get-bitlockerinfo-ps.bat"" batch script, a user can run the fix at will as necessary (this may require 8 hours for the fix to be recognized and reported to MyDevices).
Summary
The key components to this regularly scheduled fix-it batch script solution are:

get-bitlockerinfo.ps1 -- this PowerShell script sets the contents of the ""C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\BitLocker\bitlockerinfo.txt"" file with data to be collected by BigFix regarding BitLocker encryption status
run-get-bitlockerinfo-ps.bat -- this batch script calls the above PowerShell script; it is the target of the Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler task created either automatically or manually per below, and can optionally be run as administrator directly or via shortcut on demand

Automated Instructions for creating the Scheduled Task:

Download the ""bitlockerinfo-fix-files"" folder and the ""create-bitlockerinfo-fix-scheduled-task-#_#.bat"" file locally by extracting them from this zip file ; ensure both the folder and the file remain adjacent to each other
Run the ""create-bitlockerinfo-fix-scheduled-task-#_#.bat"" file as a local computer administrator
Confirm the ""Stanford - Daily Encryption Status Update #_#"" task has been created, scheduled to run hourly -- this can be adjusted to run less frequently per user preference

NOTE: When invoked by the scheduled task, the regularly scheduled batch script will flash a Command Prompt window visible to the user. This flash of a window immediately minimizes to the taskbar, then automatically terminates after approximately two seconds. Those two seconds are enough time to maximize the window and view the message indicating what is happening.
Troubleshooting
See ""C:\ProgramData\Stanford\Logs\StanfordScheduledTask-BitlockerTxt.log"" for clues on issues you might experience running the ""create-bitlockerinfo-fix-scheduled-task-#_#.bat"" batch script that automates the scheduled task creation.
Manual Instructions for creating the Schedule Task:

Download the ""bitlockerinfo-fix-files"" folder
Create a ""C:\ProgramData\Stanford"" folder, if it does not already exist; however, if this does not already exist, something else might be amiss (perhaps the BigFix client itself is problematic)
Move contents of the ""bitlockerinfo-fix-files"" folder to ""C:\ProgramData\Stanford""
Open Task Scheduler
Right-click Task Scheduler Library > Import Task... and target the ""Stanford_RoutineEncryptionStatusUpdater_1_1.xml_#_#.xml"" for import
Click Open
All settings should be in place (but you can change the schedule at this time per user preference via Triggers tab > Daily trigger selection > Edit... > setting the new time > click OK)
Click OK

NOTE: See note above about the flash of a command prompt window visible each time the scheduled task executes.
When properly set, the ""C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\BitLocker\bitlockerinfo.txt"" file contents of a fully encrypted Microsoft Windows BitLocker client look like this:
|~|OSDrive::C:|~|CipherStrength::Aes128|~|ProtectionStatus::On|~|EncryptionStatus::FullyEncrypted|~|PercentageEncrypted::100|~|Unlocked|~|WipingStatus::0|~|UnlockMethod::Password|~|RecoveryMethod::RecoveryPassword|~|
... the Management System Information in MyDevices is missing, incorrect, or out-of-date (see the ""Last Check-in Time""), there might be a problem with BigFix.
A BigFix administrator will have to take the first two steps, an end user or an IT support person the third:

Try a BigFix console refresh.
Deploy a BigFix action, ""[STANFORD] Troubleshooting: Client Forced Refresh"", to force a client refresh.
Completely remove and reinstall the BigFix client on the endpoint.

To completely remove BigFix on Windows, first look in the Programs and Features control panel. If you see ""IBM BigFix Client (Stanford)"", you can uninstall the client using the control panel. Note that the version of the BigFix installer that provides this functionality first became available in December 2016, so this option won't be available in many cases.
If you do not see ""(Stanford)"" appended to the program name in the Programs and Features control panel, in order to completely remove the client you must use the appropriate version of this utility (generally the most recent):
www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Endpoint%20Manager/page/BES%20Remove%20Utility
To completely remove BigFix on Mac OS, use the BigFix uninstaller script included with the BigFix installer disk image on Essential Stanford Software.
Sometimes the removal and reinstallation steps need to be repeated once or twice. If all else fails and the system will have no access to High Risk Data, try VLRE. Otherwise it might be necessary to rebuild the system."
Device Security,MyDevices Device Details,"Registered devices
The MyDevices app shows details of all your devices that are registered on the Stanford network so you can monitor your compliance with Stanford's information security mandates.
Information on this page comes from several source systems. If changes were made recently to a device you use (e.g., a new device was encrypted), MyDevices can take up to 24 hours to display those changes. Contact your local IT support or submit a Help ticket if you have questions or concerns about a device or its status.
To launch MyDevices, go to mydevices.stanford.edu. A list of your registered devices and the compliance status of each device displays.

If a device is listed as Compliant, the device complies with Stanford's information security mandates. If a device is listed as Not Compliant, you need to take action to make the device compliant.
If you see a device that you no longer use or has been transferred to someone else, you can click Remove to submit a request to remove the device from your record.
To see more information about a device, click the link in the Devices column to display the device details. If a device is not compliant, the reasons are listed.
View affiliations
You can check your current university affiliations and the information security mandate status for each affiliation. To do so, click the View Person Affiliations link on the center of the MyDevices home page to display your personal affiliation details:

Compliance status
If the compliance status is Not Compliant, the Device Details page will display actions you need to take to make the device compliant. After taking these actions, it can take up to 24 hours for the device status to change in MyDevices.
Weekly email notifications are sent to any faculty, staff, or postdoc who is using a  non-compliant device. You have a 30-day grace period to make the device compliant. The device details section lists the days remaining to bring the device into compliance, after which campus network access will be restricted.
Under the Notifications section, you can view the contents of an email notification by clicking the link above the date the email was sent.
Device information
After you select your device from the Devices list, you will be able to see the device status at a glance. You can easily navigate to the different types of device information. The new Status section provides additional information on device status. 

Click on any information icon () to see the system that is the source of the data displayed in a field.
If your computer is encrypted and you forget the password that unlocks the hard drive, you can retrieve your encryption key. See the Encryption Key Self-Recovery page for more information."
Device Security,Why are all users of a shared device being prompted to enroll the device?,"If BigFix is installed on a device, it will continue to prompt all new local users of a system to enroll the device until someone self-identifies as the primary user.

The primary user is the person responsible for a device's security and maintenance. This person uses the device more than anyone else, makes decisions about what applications are on it, or generally considers it their computer."
Device Security,Who should be listed as the primary user during device enrollment for shared devices?,"The primary user is the person responsible for a device's security and maintenance. In some cases a shared system, such as a lab or kiosk computer, has no primary user as such. In these cases it's usually most appropriate for the system administrator to list him- or herself as the primary user."
Device Security,What is device compliance?,"The University established a requirement to verifiably encrypt all Windows and Mac computers, as well as Apple and Android mobile devices that are used by employees on the campus network.All devices covered by the security mandate must be encrypted using the operating system's native encryption facilities. For Mac OS FileVault 2 is required, and for Windows desktop operating systems BitLocker is required. Mobile iOS and Android devices must be encrypted using their available built-in technologies.For Mac OS and Windows devices, either BigFix or VLRE must be installed in order to verify encryption in an ongoing way that can be centrally audited. Devices that have access to High Risk Data must have BigFix installed and be configured for Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) settings management .All faculty, staff and postdoc Apple and Android mobile devices used for Stanford activities on the campus network are subject to the verifiable encryption requirement. Mobile Device Management (MDM) is Stanford's mobile device security solution."
Device Security,Where can I find information about the School of Medicine security requirements?,See the Information Security Services page for information about the School of Medicine implementation of Stanford University security requirements.
Device Security,What is Stanford's computer security mandate?,"The computer security mandate's key requirement is verifiable encryption of all devices that meet any of these criteria:The device will be connected to the Stanford network (excluding Stanford Visitor and eduroam wireless networks, and sponsored wireless access for guests); orThe device is owned by Stanford regardless of location; orThe device will be used to access High Risk Data from any location regardless of ownership.All devices covered by the mandate must be encrypted using the operating system's native encryption facilities. For macOS FileVault 2 is required, and for Windows desktop operating systems BitLocker is required. Mobile iOS and Android devices must be encrypted using their available built-in technologies.In the case of macOS and Windows, either BigFix or VLRE must be used to verify encryption in an ongoing way that can be centrally audited. In the case of mobile iOS and Android devices, Stanford's Mobile Device Management service must be used. For more information see Security Requirements Questions and Answers."

Device Security,Getting Started with Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE),"Encryption can result in irretrievable loss of data if the keys or passphrases are misplaced or destroyed; consult a qualified system administrator if you feel you need assistance.
Getting started
With your manager, determine if it is absolutely necessary that you store Moderate or High Risk Data on your computer and that Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) is the best solution for you to protect University data. Please see the Information Security Office's Risk Classifications guide for more information.
The best protection of University data from computer loss or theft is to avoid storing it on a computer.
If you determine that you need to install Stanford Whole Disk Encryption, contact your local desktop support staff who can help you download and run the SWDE installer. Your computer will need to be part of your local BigFix domain.
With the assistance of the Service Desk or your local desktop support staff, you will download and run the SWDE installer, select an appropriate means to encrypt your system and begin the encryption process.
On Macintosh systems, native encryption is entirely transparent once enabled.  On Windows systems, the only noticeable difference is the need to enter another password of your choosing upon booting.
What it protects or prevents
Stanford Whole Disk Encryption protects your files if your computer is lost or stolen. If someone tries to break into your system to retrieve files, they will not be able to access the computer as long as they do not have the ability to log in. This is most useful for laptop computers and desktop systems with Moderate or High Risk Data.
What it doesn't protect or prevent
Stanford Whole Disk Encryption is limited to protecting the files while they are on your computer. It does not provide encryption to files that are:

sent via email;
kept on a separate flash drive/thumb drive/USB drive/floppy disk; or
moved over the network via shared folders.

When you move an encrypted file off of your computer, it is no longer encrypted,
If you forget your passphrase or your passphrase changes
The PIN created for use with BitLocker should be different from your SUNetID password. They will be not synchronized with your SUNet ID password. If you are unable to log in for some reason, you can contact University IT or your local support provider. Call (650) 725-4357 or submit a Help ticket. 
What to expect

The initial encryption process can be resource-intensive on your computer, so plan a time when you can leave your computer plugged into AC power and a time when you can tolerate a slowdown in performance. 
You must follow the best practice of password protecting your computer at all times, including stand by, sleep, hibernate, and via screen savers. This practice is fundamental to the success of the Whole Disk Encryption technology and the accompanying audit. 
Once installed, encryption takes place in the background all the time; each new file is encrypted automatically. 
Your computer will become a member of the local BigFix domain. 
Removal of whole disk encryption is a very time-consuming process and is not recommended. If necessary it can be enabled by University IT staff to guarantee the integrity of the audit trail. Plan to remove the encryption when you can tolerate a very slow machine for over 10 hours..

How to get help
If you encounter problems, or have any questions, please submit a Help ticket."
Device Security,Where can I find in-depth technical information about SWDE?,See SWDE Information for Technical Support Staff .
Device Security,What should an IT professional know about encrypting multiple fixed disks?,"IMPORTANT:

For Windows, we can only escrow BitLocker recovery keys for the system volume. Any additional volumes encrypted using BitLocker need to have their recovery keys manually recorded, by saving them to a removable drive, or printing them out, or writing them down.For Windows, be sure BitLocker is configured to be unlocked automatically.Be sure your computer is being backed up before encrypting.

Multi-boot systems in the general case cannot be encrypted. Unofficial instructions for encrypting Apple Boot Camp devices can be found on the web, but the steps are many and complicated. For most purposes, it's almost always preferable to run additional operating systems in a virtual machine. If a system must remain multi-boot, the user should request a compliance exception.

Device Security,What is VLRE?,"For computers that do not handle High Risk Data, SWDE is recommended but there is an option to install VLRE (Very Lightweight Reporting Engine, pronounced “velour”), a read-only agent that provides encryption verification without requiring BigFix. VLRE periodically reports on the computer's encryption and screen saver password status, but leaves maintenance of the computer entirely to the user. If your computer is not encrypted, the VLRE installer steps you through the encryption process."

Device Security,NetDB Record Creation and Modification Rights,"Within NetDB, rights to modify a record are granted only through the ""Group"" and ""Record Type"" fields. Most NetDB users only need to create or modify ""Node"" record types, sometimes ""Advanced Node"" records. 

In order to be able to create a node within an IP range, the NetDB user has to share a NetDB Group with the IP range. For example, if the NetDB user ""George Jetson"" is only a member of the Groups ""Stanford"" and ""Cogswell Cogs,"" but 10.10.10.0/24 only allows users in the Group ""Spacely Sprockets"" to create IP numbers in that range, then George Jetson cannot create IP numbers in that range. He would need to put in a ticket requesting that one of his Groups have rights to that range. Access to an IP range must be granted by Group, not by individual user or list of users, or Admin Team.

If George Jetson wants to modify a record, that record has to have at least one of his Groups associated with it. If there is a Node record ""Cosmo-Spacely.Stanford.EDU"" that has only the ""Spacely Sprockets"" group associated with it, then George Jetson cannot modify that record, even if he is listed as the Node Administrator or if that record is in an IP range to which he normally has access. 

The NetDB field ""Administrator"" is only used to list which individuals or Admin Teams are custodians for a particular physical or virtual device, not for the NetDB record. It does not grant any access to modify a NetDB record. Adding someone as an Administrator does not grant any rights within NetDB, it only provides contact information should someone have questions about a physical or virtual device.

A NetDB ""Admin Team"" is a convenient way to list more than one person a custodian for a physical or virtual device. The Administrator field must be a person from the Stanford directory, and will create a link to that individual's directory entry for phone number or email. An Admin Team can have a shared email or phone number associated with it, which is often much more convenient.

Nearly every NetDB user is a member of the ""Stanford"" group. This allows them to create records within the Stanford.EDU domain. Domain records also have Groups associated with them, so if your organization needs 3rd level domains, then rights to create records within those domains can be limited by Group membership.

If a NetDB Node record needs to be passed from one NetDB user to another, the easiest way to do that is to add the ""Stanford"" group to that Node, remove all other groups, and inform the other user that they can modify that Node. The other user should then add one or more Groups to which they have rights and remove the ""Stanford"" Group.

The NetDB help pages can be found here: https://web.stanford.edu/group/networking/netdb/help/prod//index.html"
Device Security,Back Up Your Encryption Recovery Key (Windows),"If your computer is encrypted and you forget the password that unlocks your hard drive, you'll need the encryption recovery key to unlock your drive. In most cases, Stanford users have their recovery keys backed up in a secure database by the university. The recovery key can then be retrieved in MyDevices.
Due to a bug that has now been fixed, some recovery keys that were saved using the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) service cannot be retrieved in MyDevices. You can check to see if any device belonging to you has a key available for retrieval in MyDevices.
If your device is encrypted but your encryption recovery key cannot be retrieved in MyDevices, you can use the Key Escrow Tool to fix the problem.

Server Security,Build OSSEC from Source,"These instructions explain how to install OSSEC from source. The provided configuration may not be appropriate for all classes of machines.
If not already installed, install the Splunk Universal Forwarder. If already installed, proceed to step five.Go to Splunk Universal Forwarder for Linux Servers for installation and configuration instructions. Be sure to set a valid index in inputs.conf, as explained in the instructions.Note:  Cloud-based and private-network hosts forward logs to a host they can connect to internally using rsyslog. The rsyslog host then forwards all logs to Splunk using Splunk Universal Forwarder. This requires a privileged connection, like a VPN connection.For more information about rsyslog, see Splunk via rsyslog for Linux Servers.Add the following stanzas to /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf in order to configure the forwarding of logs from OSSEC to Splunk:
[monitor:///var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log]​
disabled=0
sourcetype=ossec_alerts

[monitor:///var/ossec/logs/ossec.log]​
disabled=0​
sourcetype=ossec_log​

[monitor:///var/ossec/logs/active-responses.log]​

<ignore> statements may not work to exclude a directory from scanning, if the parent directory is included for scanning.
Start the OSSEC service when you are done configuring it:
service ossec start
Confirm the OSSEC service is running normally. This can be done by checking the local status of the OSSEC service in /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log. As soon as the service starts, a log like this should appear in the log file:
2017 Jun 29 07:52:27 basecamp->ossec-monitord 
Rule: 502 (level 3) -> 'Ossec server started.' 
ossec: Ossec started.
After about 15 minutes of operation, new entries should appear in the log file showing that initial system checks were completed by OSSEC.Verify that logs are being forwarded to Splunk using a simple search. For example, if your hostname is ‘stanford555’, your search will look like this:​

Servers,UNIX Documentation at Stanford,"Legacy documentation for UNIX that was once part of the timeshare service documentation has moved to the FarmShare wiki.
Examples of UNIX documentation available on the wiki include:

UNIX_Command_Summary
Installed Packages
Emacs Command Reference
Nano Command Reference
X Window System"
Servers,Scheduling Commands and Scripts,"Overview
The scheduling service allows you to run commands or scripts at specified intervals. The scripts are stored in AFS. The commands are called “cron jobs,” and they're useful for a variety of purposes such as rebuilding a search index hourly, updating a web site daily, or running monthly reports on databases. You can use the scheduling service tool to create new jobs or edit existing ones.

Flexible schedule: schedule jobs through an easy-to-use web interface.
Dedicated servers: run your specified jobs from a pool of dedicated servers. You don't have to run your own server for cron jobs or use any other UNIX machine where updates and reboots can affect scheduled jobs.
Shared administration: run jobs as a CGI principal (jdoe.cgi), a cron principal (jdoe.cron), or a group or department's CGI principal (dept-example.cgi — this allows other members of that group to administer the settings).

Run administrative tasks automatically
The admin for a Drupal website must run some tasks regularly: for example, update the index search, trim the logs, and check for security updates. Drupal provides a web page that will run these tasks for you, but it requires regular visits to this page every day (or every hour).
Instead, you can use the scheduling service to perform these tasks. Use the web page provided by Drupal to run these tasks — known as “cron.php” — and a UNIX program called “curl” that can request web pages from the command line. Then use the service to schedule a job that uses curl to request cron.php at regular intervals with the following command:
curl -sS https://www.stanford.edu/dept/example/cgi-bin/drupal/cron.php
The two flags (-sS) tell curl to be silent unless there are errors.
Set Access Control Lists (ACLs)
If you are using the scheduling service to run a script, it is important to assign the appropriate Access Control List (ACL) in the script's parent directory so that the CGI principal can run the script. (If you're unsure of what ACLs are and what they do, see the Setting Permissions with UNIX page for more information.)
For example, if you are running a script as group-foo/cgi at /afs/ir/group/foo/cgi-bin/tools/foo.sh
then you can fix the permissions problems by assigning the rlidwk ACLs (read, lookup, insert, delete, write, and lock permissions) to the group-foo.cgi file in the directory /afs/ir/group/foo/cgi-bin/tools.
Run the following command from anywhere you have access to AFS ACLs and press Enter:
fs sa /afs/ir/group/foo/cgi-bin/tools group-foo.cgi rlidwk
The directory permissions are reset and the cron job errors should stop.
Get started
To get started, first determine what command or script in AFS you'd like to run and then visit the scheduler's web interface at tools.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/scheduler."
Servers,Using VNC with FarmShare,"On this page:

Introduction
Before you begin
VNC on Mac OS X
VNC on Windows
VNC on UNIX/Linux

Introduction
UNIX/Linux applications with a graphical user interface require the use of special display software when connecting from a remote location. Two methods are currently supported: X-windows and VNC. See Using X-windows for information about X-windows.
VNC is a protocol and associated software that supports remote display on a variety of computer platforms. It is useful when certain applications fail to run properly under X-windows, or when a persistent connection to the remote display is required. You can disconnect from a VNC session and reconnect to it later as long as the terminal session used to start the VNC server application is still running.
The university maintains the necessary server application for use with Stanford FarmShare, but users must download and install a suitable client application; see below for recommendations. Because secure connections are required in the Stanford FarmShare environment, SSH must be used to encrypt the VNC connection. SSH does not have any special support for VNC so encryption must be accomplished manually using SSH port forwarding.
Before you begin
If you have never used VNC before you must set a VNC password before you start vncserver for the first time (see below). This password will control access to the display and will prevent a third-party from viewing or controlling your VNC session.

Connect to any Stanford UNIX rice.
Create a VNC application directory if one does not already exist:mkdir ~/.vnc
Run the vncpasswd command to set a new password. This password is not very secure, so it should not be the same as your SUNet ID password (or other sensitive passwords).

Using VNC on Mac OS X
There are a number of freely available VNC clients for Mac OS X. Of these turbovnc is the best performing. Please follow the steps outlined in the wiki to download and create your session.
Using VNC on Windows
There are a number of freely available VNC clients for Windows, but SSVNC is recommended for most users. This client includes built-in support for SSH tunnelling of the VNC display, which streamlines the connection procedure. You must also have SecureCRT or another SSH client installed in order to establish a primary terminal session. Please follow the steps outlined in the wiki to download and create your session.
Using VNC on UNIX/Linux
Some distributions of Linux include a VNC client as part of the default desktop configuration, but others are freely available. Check the standard software repositories for your distribution to determine the options. If turbovnc is available then that would make a great choice. Please follow the steps outlined in the wiki to download and create your session."
Servers,Using X-windows with FarmShare,"On this page:

Introduction
XQuartz on Mac OS X
Xming on Windows
X11 on UNIX/Linux

Introduction
UNIX/Linux applications with a graphical user-interface require the use of special display software when connecting from a remote location. Two methods are currently supported: X-windows and VNC. X-windows (X11) is recommended for most users, but VNC is useful when certain applications fail to run properly under X-windows, or when a persistent connection to the remote display is required. See Using VNC for information about VNC.
X-windows is the native display technology on UNIX and Linux systems and is designed for networked use. Because secure connections are required in the Stanford timeshare environment, SSH must be used to encrypt the X-windows connection; most SSH clients have built-in support for X display forwarding.
Using XQuartz on OS X
XQuartz is a free X11 server implementation for OS X. You can download the XQuartz application at MacOSForge.

Verify that XQuartz is installed and launch the XQuartz application (located in the Utilities subfolder of the Applications folder). An xterm window should open by default. If no terminal window opens, start one by selecting Terminal from the File menu or pressing COMMAND + N.
You may need to restart your computer after the installation of XQuartz, so try that if the following doesn't immediately work for you.
In xterm, connect to any Stanford timeshare using the ssh command. You must specify the -X option to enable display forwarding. (If the -X option doesn't work try -Y.) For example:ssh -X sunetid@rice.stanford.edu In some cases, enabling compression by specifying the -C option can improve performance, especially when connecting from outside the campus network:ssh -CX sunetid@rice.stanford.edu
Authenticate using your SUNet ID password. After connecting, the remote machine will display a standard prompt, as with normal connections, but remote applications with a graphical user-interface will automatically use the local display.
To end the session, quit all remote applications, type exit to close the SSH connection.  You can also quit XQuartz if you like.

Using MobaXterm on Windows
The easiest thing to do on Windows is to use the free personal version of MobaXterm which includes an X11 server:  https://web.stanford.edu/group/farmshare/cgi-bin/wiki/index.php/Mobaxterm
Using Xming on Windows
Xming is a freely available X server for Windows. It uses PuTTY, a built-in SSH client, to forward the display.
Note: These instructions assume you are using the version of PuTTY built into and distributed with Xming. You do not need to have a separate copy of PuTTY installed; if you do have a separate copy installed you should not start a separate instance of PuTTY with X-Windows forwarding enabled  before connecting, unless you have configured Xming accordingly. Users of PuTTY may want to review the suggested configuration.

Download and install the public domain releases of Xming and Xming-fonts. The default installation options for Xming should be sufficient. The 100dpi, Trutype, and Deja Vu fonts available in Xming-fonts are optional, but recommended.
Once installation is complete, run Xming.

You can configure the display settings for each session as desired, but Multiple windows is standard.
Select the option to Start a program.
Use the default program, xterm, but choose Run Remote Using PuTTY Link (plink.exe) and make sure With compression is checked.
- You may connect to any Stanford timeshare computer (e.g., corn.stanford.edu). Log in using your SUNet ID, but leave the Password field blank; you will be prompted for your SUNet ID password upon connection.
No special parameter settings are required.


Optionally, save this configuration for future use, and then connect, providing your password when required. An xterm window will open and the remote machine will display a standard UNIX prompt, as with normal connections. However, remote applications with a graphical user-interface will automatically use the local display.
To end the session, quit all remote applications, type exit to close the xterm window. Xming will quit automatically when the xterm window is closed.

Using X11 on UNIX/Linux
Because X11 is the native display technology on UNIX and Linux systems it is possible to connect to any Stanford timeshare for remote display simply by opening a Terminal window and running ssh with the -X option.

Open a Terminal window and connect to any Stanford timeshare using the ssh command with the -X option. (If the -X option doesn't work try -Y.) For example:ssh -X sunetid@rice.stanford.edu In some cases, enabling compression by specifying the -C option can improve performance, especially when connecting from outside the campus network:ssh -CX sunetid@rice.stanford.edu
Authenticate using your SUNet ID password. After connecting, the remote machine will display a standard prompt, as with normal connections, but remote applications with a graphical user-interface will automatically use the local display.
To end the session, quit all remote applications and type exit to close the SSH connection."
Servers,FarmShare Policies,"Overview
This document outlines the conditions of use for the FarmShare computers run by University IT. First and foremost, all use of these machines is covered by the policies set forth in Stanford University's Administrative Guide , which defines overall university computing policy.
If you are a student, the Fundamental Standard applies to your use of these systems. If you are faculty, staff, or a part-time worker (including a student employee), the University Code of Conduct applies to your use of these systems.
If you have any questions, please submit a Help ticket.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Rules for all FarmShare machines
These policies apply to the academic quarter, which is defined as starting on the first day of instruction on the Undergraduate Calendar and running though the last day of finals. Summer quarter (the longest of the Summer terms available) is included.
Note: There may be individual machines, or classes of machines, that are excluded from these limits. These exceptions will be noted in each machine's login message, also known as the “Message of the Day” (motd).

These resources may not be used for commercial purposes.
Users are not allowed to try to gain unauthorized access into any computer, nor are users allowed to test for system vulnerabilities.  Users also may not use these systems for making such attempts against other systems within, or outside of, Stanford.
The ""/tmp"" space on each system is for temporary storage. Around midnight, files that have not been touched for 24 hours get deleted automatically. Users are allowed to run programs that circumvent this automatic process (e.g., ""tmptouch"" scripts), but not for more than 2 weeks.
Users may not run distributed clients such as distributed.net, SETI@Home, or Folding@home, except by prior arrangement for a class.
Users may not run public servers, such as chat rooms or database servers, except by prior arrangement for a class.
Users may not run any program that debilitates the computer on which it is running or debilitates other systems. Examples of this include, but are not limited to:

Running a program that uses up most of the system memory.
Filling up the ""/tmp"" space on a system. Users should not be using more than a third of the available tmp space on a system.
Running a program that does heavy disk I/O and is writing files into the general AFS space. Use /tmp space for such programs, then copy any files you wish to keep into AFS space periodically, or when the program is done.


May not be used to transmit, store, or compute with Prohibited or Restricted Information, as defined by the Stanford University Data Classification criteria.

Additional rules for rice machines

During the regular academic quarter, users are limited to 10 concurrent CPU-intensive, or memory-intensive, programs. If you require more resources, please use the wheat machines. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, Matlab, SAS, gaussian, and many java programs."

Overview
Stanford's Mobile Device Management (MDM) service installs profiles on your device that configure and maintain settings on your device. MDM helps protect your privacy and the university's data.
Before you can enroll your Android device in the MDM service, you must install the Intelligent Hub app from the Google Play Store. You need a Google account to do this.
Depending on your device, you may also need to install additional services to support the enterprise capabilities of your device. If your device blocks the installation, change your security settings to allow the installation of applications not obtained from the Google Play Store.
During the enrollment process, you'll be required to set a password with a minimum of four characters on your device.
Back up your device before enrolling! Your cellular carrier typically provides a mechanism to back up your pictures, contacts, etc. Do this first.
What to expect after you enroll in MDM

Transfer your phone number to Stanford's corporate account
Choose your preferred carrier and transfer your phone number to Stanford's corporate account.

If you keep the same carrier, the billing change requires a transfer of liability.
If you switch carriers, the billing change requires a port.

For a Transfer of Liability (TOL):

The account holder needs to contact the carrier to authorize the release of your mobile number to Stanford University. If on a family plan, discuss with your carrier the impact of changes.
If this number is a Pre-Paid line, it must be converted to a Post Paid account before submitting a request to transfer to a corporate account.
Equipment Installment and contract plans must be paid in full before transferring the liability of the mobile number to Stanford.
Ask the carrier to note in your account that you give permission for a transfer of liability to Stanford. The representative may use the acronym ""TOL"" when confirming your permission.

Be sure to indicate the exact shipping address for the prompt delivery of the mobile device. Street address, room number, and correct zip code are required to prevent shipment delays.
If this is a Transfer of Liability or Port from Personal to Stanford University:

Make sure the account holder calls the carrier directly to place a notation releasing financial responsibility to Stanford University.
The carrier name, billing address, account number, and pin code on the account are required for a port.
Confirm that the mobile number is not on a device payment plan or tied to a contract. This will allow Stanford to assume liability and avoid any order delays. If on a family plan, inform the client to work with a mobile carrier on the impact of billing for their personal account.
Ensure that the personal account is current, with no past-due charges.

Mobile Devices,How to Correct an iOS device That Has Disconnected From Workspace ONE (AirWatch),"iOS devices enrolled in Stanford's Mobile Device Management (MDM) service, Workspace ONE (formerly known as AirWatch), may have recently lost communication with the admin console due to a vendor configuration issue.
If your device was affected, you should follow the steps below to unenroll it from Workspace ONE and then re-enroll it. This will ensure your device can be verified as compliant and continues to work with all Stanford applications. 
Before you begin

To ensure uninterrupted access to your Stanford email and calendar from your mobile device, re-enroll your device immediately after you complete unenrollment process.
After you unenroll your device, you can continue to access your email on another computer or device or use Webmail (https://webmail.stanford.edu) temporarily on your iOS device.
The size of the mailbox and calendar determines how long the re-enrollment takes. Typically, the process is completed in a few minutes, but extremely large mailboxes and calendars may take several hours to fully download.
It’s recommended that your device be connected to a Wi-Fi network during enrollment because of the bandwidth used to download your email and calendar.

Step One: Unenroll your device

Locate the Hub app on your device. Note: If you cannot find the Hub app, skip this section and follow the steps listed below under ""Step Two: Delete Device Management Profile"" to manually delete the profile.
Open the Hub app. Tap This Device and then select Enrollment.
Select Unenroll Device. 
When you see the warning message, tap Unenroll to confirm.
Upon un-enrollment, Stanford apps will be removed and your Stanford email and calendar will likely be deleted. Once this process is complete you’ll see the enrollment prompt in the Hub app. Before you re-enroll your device, follow the steps under ""Step Two: Delete Device Management Profile"" to verify the Device Management Profile is deleted.

Step Two: Delete Device Management Profile
Your Device Management profile may not delete during un-enrollment or you may have to delete it manually if the Hub app is missing. Follow these steps to confirm the Device Management Profile has been removed and to delete it manually, if necessary.

On your device, go to Settings > General.
Scroll down toward the bottom of the list to see if Device Manager is displayed.

If Device Management is missing your un-enrollment is complete and you can follow the steps below under the section ""Step Three: Re-enroll Your Device."" 
If you see Device Management displayed, open it, and select Device Management.


At the bottom of the screen, select Remove Management.

Step Three: Re-enroll Your Device
Now you are ready to re-enroll your device. To do this, visit the University IT webpage Enroll an iOS Device in Mobile Device Management and follow the steps under ""Enroll in MDM."""

Calendar,Calendar Best Practices,"Best Practices for Microsoft 365 CalendaringUniversity IT offers the following recommendations to keep calendar usage consistent, courteous, and professional. Some departments may want to incorporate a subset of these practices in a policy they establish for how their employees should use the Microsoft 365 Calendar.Use Preferred ClientsOWA (Outlook Web App), Microsoft Outlook, and the Outlook mobile app are the recommended clients. Keep current with Microsoft Office Updates - There are known issues that are fixed with each service pack or update. Make sure your mobile device has the latest OS/iOS version. If you must use a mobile device to manage your calendar, use the Outlook app to accept/decline meeting requests. It is recommended that mobile devices only be used for viewing your calendar. Mobile devices tend to cause the most issues with appointments becoming corrupt, missing, or out of sync. Scheduling an appointment just for yourself on your mobile device is ok. DelegatesOnly ONE person should process meeting invites - Make sure that only one user for each mailbox receives and processes meeting requests. If you have more than one delegate, having only one receive the meeting requests is preferred. If more than one receives the requests, the delegates and owner must decide who will be processing all the meeting requests. All other computers/devices and people should ignore (i.e. do not process, do not delete) meeting requests for the mailbox if they receive them.Creating and Editing MeetingsIt is recommended that meeting creation and edits are done on OWA (Outlook Web App). Microsoft Outlook can be used for your own calendar use but for any calendar delegation it is recommended to use OWA (Outlook Web App)If you must cancel or reschedule a meeting, please try to notify attendees at least 24 hours before the scheduled start time. Many staff check their calendars only at the beginning of their day. Last-minute changes or cancellations can go unnoticed.If you want to invite people to a meeting without letting them know who else is invited, please send an email rather than an appointment. All meeting attendees can see who else is invited, but cannot see their attendance status. Only the organizer of the meeting can see attendee status.When inviting a group to a meeting, invite using individual email addresses (or a Contact Group). Do not invite Mailman mailing lists to a meeting. While the list may have a free schedule, the members of the list may be busy. When a member responds, that person’s email address will be added to the invitation, and the member will receive two copies of all further messages about that meeting.Handling Meeting Requests
	Respond to meeting invitations promptly with an Accept, Decline, or Tentative. By making a choice, you keep the meeting organizer informed so that they can better decide if they need to reschedule an appointment, plan for refreshments, or work with you outside of the scheduled meeting time.
	
	Always Respond to Meeting Requests in the Inbox - We recommend that you always accept or decline a meeting request from the Inbox. If you accept or decline a meeting by using the meeting item in the Calendar in Outlook, the meeting request remains in the Inbox. It is important that you do not delete a meeting request from the Inbox until you are sure that the meeting has been processed. The following text appears in the InfoBar of the meeting request when the meeting request has been processed: Accepted by username on date, time.
	
	Don’t copy/paste meeting events.  These are especially susceptible to corruption and causing problems.
	
	Don't move meeting requests - Don't move a meeting request from your Inbox to a different folder before you accept or decline the request or before the meeting appears in your calendar. Soon after a meeting request arrives in your Inbox, a piece of Outlook code — nicknamed the ""sniffer"" — automatically adds the meeting to your calendar and marks it as tentative. This is a fail-safe to keep you from missing the meeting in case you don't see the request in your Inbox. However, the sniffer doesn't reply to the meeting organizer. You still need to do that by accepting, accepting as tentative, or declining the request. If you or a rule that you create moves an incoming meeting request from your Inbox before the sniffer can process the request, the meeting never appears in your calendar, and you might miss the meeting.
	
	Don't delete a meeting request on one computer after you accept the same meeting request on another computer - If you are using two computers that connect to the same mailbox (e.g., a desktop computer that is using Online mode and a laptop computer that is using Cached Exchange Mode). The meeting request that you accepted on the Desktop computer is immediately processed. The meeting request that you deleted on the laptop computer is synchronized later. After synchronization, the meeting on the desktop computer is also deleted.
	
	Don't auto-accept meeting requests - If you have granted one or more persons delegate access to your calendar or if you have delegate access to someone else's calendar, turn off automatic acceptance of meeting requests. By turning off automatic acceptance you avoid problems with delegate workflow by allowing you and/or your delegate the opportunity to review all meeting requests, respond appropriately, keep track of meetings and any changes, as well as minimize schedule conflicts.
	
	If you receive a meeting cancellation, click Remove from Calendar to remove the meeting from your calendar - Deleting the cancellation from your Inbox won't remove the meeting from your calendar when using some clients.
	
	Do not forward meeting requests - the meeting attendee list becomes out of date and tracking does not work properly for the forwarded users.  Any updates to the meeting are only sent to the original attendees, not the forwarded users. If you feel a colleague should also attend, email the organizer of the meeting and ask to have that individual added. No one likes surprise guests.​
	Recurring Meetings
	Schedule end dates on recurring meetings - It is recommended that you set an end date (no more than 12 months) when you schedule a recurring meeting. When you add a definite end date, you may prevent issues that may occur if you have to update the meeting several times. If you schedule an end date on meetings, you can create a new meeting if you realize that the meeting has to be frequently modified.
	
	If you want to discontinue a recurring meeting, open the series and add an end date. All meetings scheduled after that date will be deleted automatically from the attendees’ calendars. If you delete the series entirely, all past occurrences of the meeting are removed as well.
	
	To change an entire series of meetings, cancel the original meeting and create a new one.  To change one instance, cancel just that meeting and create a new one to replace it.  Always put an end date on a recurring meeting.
	
	A ""corrupt"" meeting will remain that way until you delete it.  If it is a recurring appointment, delete all occurrences and reschedule it.
	
	Avoid frequent changes - Recurring meetings can become lost or duplicated if they are modified too many times. If you have a series that requires many changes, like multiple location changes, cancel the series for everyone and create individual meetings instead or shorten the recurrence period to 3-6 months instead of 1 year or more. 
	​OtherNotes included in the body of the Appointment Details are emailed to all meeting attendees. Keep private meeting notes separate.Block times on your calendar when you are not available. This includes vacation time as well as setting your calendar to show when you are routinely out of the office. Your closest colleagues may be aware that you work an unusual schedule, but others may not and could request a meeting with you before your train arrives in the morning or after your carpool leaves in the afternoon.When scheduling a vacation day on your calendar, be sure to show your time as Free if you are inviting others.Troubleshooting​

Calendar,How to Designate Who Can Schedule a Resource,"The best practice for reserving a meeting room or resource, such as a car, is to invite the resource to  a meeting via the attendee list.  Most resources at Stanford are open so that anyone within Stanford can reserve (invite) the resource.  Some resources restrict who has the ability to invite and view availability of the resource.  
If the resource is restricted to a list of users, the list is stored in the resource's calendar options.  The options are only accessible by the resource owner or admin, and is only available from Outlook on the web.
Note: The rights to see details of a calendar or to be able to directly edit the calendar are granted by setting the permissions on the calendar by right-clicking the calendar.   These permissions are separate from restrictions placed on inviting the resource, which is discussed below.

Before your begin, check the setting in the upper-right, just beneath the banner,  to make sure you are not using the new Outlook. You will not be able to access the resource calendar settings in the new Outlook.

Open a resource calendar
Log in to webmail.stanford.edu.Click your name or picture in the top-right corner and then click Open another mailbox.Enter name or email address of the resource and click Open. This opens the resource account in a new tab.

Calendar,What Should I Do When My iPhone Calendar and Outlook/Webmail Are Not Syncing?,"Description
Calendar events created from the native iPhone Calendar app are not syncing to your Outlook or Webmail calendar. However, calendar events created in Outlook or Webmail show up on your iPhone calendar just fine.
Cause
The default calendar on the iPhone is not set to your Stanford calendar. Therefore, events initiated on the iPhone are being saved to a different calendar. This results in the event showing up on your iPhone but not your Outlook or Webmail calendar.
Resolution
Change your iPhone's default calendar and re-save all existing events to your Stanford calendar. This requires changing your iPhone's settings, but ensures events will show up on both your iPhone and Outlook/Webmail calendar going forward.

Go to Settings > Calendar (or Mail, Contact, Calendars).

Research Systems,Cayuse Outgoing Subawards Guide,"Stanford Electronic Research Administration

Cayuse 424 – Outgoing Subaward Quick Guide – Stanford will Issue a Subaward
Scenario #1: Stanford is the pass through institution, our subrecipient uses Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs.  - Importing a Cayuse Subaward Proposal
The subrecipient institution can create a standalone subaward proposal within their Cayuse account, export it as a .cayuse file, and send it to us via email. We then import the subaward proposal into our prime proposal. See the current list of institutions that use Cayuse 424.
1. Request from the subrecipient institution that they prepare a standalone subaward proposal, export it in a .cayuse file format and email it you. Save the file somewhere convenient on your computer or shared drive.
2. Navigate to Cayuse 424 from SeRA at https://sera.stanford.edu

3.Select the prime proposal you are developing. 

4. From within your prime proposal, on the left-hand navigation panel, click the check box next to the RR Subaward Budget Attachment form to include the form with your submission. Click the form itself.
5. Click the Import Subaward button from within the R&R SUBAWARD BUDGET ATTACHMENT(S) FORM.

6. An Import Subaward dialog box will open.

Select a name for the subaward.
Browse and select the .cayuse subaward proposal file you received from the subrecipient.
Click the Import button.

7. A Link in Subaward Proposal dialog box will open. Review the budget periods of the prime and subaward. Click Link in Subaward (or Cancel if you need to make additional modifications before import).

8. A Importing Key Persons and Performance Site data dialog box will open. Allow for any data to completely load, and click Finish.

9. The subaward proposal will open and be linked to your prime proposal.  You can edit both the prime and sub proposals as needed.
Scenario #2 Stanford is the pass through institution, our subrecipient does NOT use Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs. - Importing a Subawards.com Proposal
Institutions that do not use Cayuse can easily and quickly create subaward proposals for importing into Cayuse 424 proposals at http://subawards.com free of charge. Subawards.com has robust customer support and resources to respond to questions a subrecipient may have.

Request your subrecipient institution to go to http://subawards.com to initiate, complete, and export a standalone subaward proposal in the .cayuse file format.
Have your subrecipient institution send their standalone subaward proposal .cayuse file to you via email. Save the file somewhere convenient on your computer or shared drive.
Follow steps 2-9 of the above Scenario #1 to import the sub proposal to your prime proposal.

Scenario #3 Stanford is the pass through institution, our subrecipient does NOT use Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs. - Importing subaward data directly from Adobe Grants.gov (Workspace) forms.
Institutions that do not use Cayuse may complete the Grants.gov downloadable Adobe subaward budget form being used by the relative federal opportunity # and send it to Stanford for upload/importing into Stanford’s Cayuse. 
1. Request from the subrecipient institution they complete and email the relative Grants.gov downloadable Adobe subaward budget form being used by the federal opportunity # to which you are applying in addition to any other required application components i.e. subaward Key Personnel Biosketches etc.

To identify which Grants.gov subaward budget form is being used by your opportunity #...


Navigate to the Cayuse Opportunities tab.
Look up the opportunity # to which you are applying.
Click the “i” icon next to the relative opportunity Number. 
An Opportunity Details dialogue box will open. Under Forms you will see which forms are supported by this opportunity including which sub budget form.

2. Upon receipt of the files from the subrecipient save the file(s) somewhere convenient on your computer or shared drive.
3. Follow steps 2-9 of the above Scenario #1: to import the sub proposal to your prime proposal.
4. Upload any other required subaward application components i.e. subaward Key Personnel Biosketches etc.
Notes on Importing Adobe PDF Subaward Budget Forms:
Calculated Totals - Cayuse 424 imports all budget data except calculated totals. Line items and their amounts are imported and then Cayuse 424 calculates totals.
Attachments - Cayuse 424 is able to import most attachments found in Adobe PDF forms, such as a subaward budget justification.  However, budget overflow attachments for Additional Senior Key Persons and Additional Equipment are not imported the same way. Instead, items for those overflow attachments must be entered in the budget form within Cayuse 424 so the application can perform operations on that data, including calculating totals and generating the necessary overflow attachments for you. For this reason, Senior Key Persons and/or Equipment that is to appear in an overflow attachment must be entered manually in Cayuse 424.
Scenario #4 Stanford is the pass through institution, our subrecipient does NOT use Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs. – Creating a Subaward Proposal within Stanford’s Cayuse
In addition to being able to import subaward proposals, Stanford Cayuse users can also create subaward proposals from within a prime proposal. 
To facilitate creation of a subawards proposals, it is best if there is already an institutional profile for the subrecipient institution and professional profiles for the subrecipient institution Key Persons in Stanford’s Cayuse.  Users can create and edit these through the People and Institutions tabs in Cayuse.  At a minimum, the subrecipient institutional profile should have the legal Organization Name, a DUNS number, and at least one named IDC Rate with a start date established for the rate.
1. Navigate to Cayuse 424 from SeRA at https://sera.stanford.edu.

2. Select the prime proposal you are developing. 

3. From within your prime proposal, on the left-hand navigation panel, click the check box next to the RR Subaward Budget Attachment form to include the form with your submission. Click the form itself.
4. Click the Create Subaward button from within the R&R SUBAWARD BUDGET ATTACHMENT(S) FORM.

5. A Create New Subaward dialog box will open.

Enter a name for the subaward proposal.
Select the subrecipient institution from the dropdown menu. If you do not see your subrecipient institution, navigate to the Institutions tab at the top of the page and add it by following the instructions found here. At a minimum, the subrecipient institutional profile must have the legal Organization Name, a DUNS number, and one named IDC Rate with a start date established for the rate.
Select the default IDC rate. Cayuse proposals can support multiple IDC rates, so if your sub need multiple rates for your proposal select the one you will use the most here. You can add the additional rates from within the budget pages of the proposal.
The number of budget periods will default to match your prime proposal.
Enter the sponsor due date.
Click Create Subaward.

6. Your newly created sub proposal will open to the first page of the sub budget form. Complete the sub budget pages and any other required sub forms such as the RR Performance Sites and RR Key Persons forms. Please note, different opportunities require different forms, so please read your program guidelines carefully to ensure you complete all the mandatory forms and provide all the requisite information for your subs.

Research Systems,Linking a Cayuse 424 Proposal to a PDRF,"Stanford Electronic Research Administration

Linking a Cayuse 424 Proposal to a PDRF
One can link a Cayuse 424 proposal to a SeRA PDRF to populate the PDRF with information from the Cayuse 424 proposal to reduce duplicative data entry.  A Cayuse 424 proposal can be linked to a PDRF at all stages of a PDRF transaction before completion and for all PDRF types. 
Information* that can be pulled from a Cayuse 424 proposal and pushed to a SeRA PDRF includes:

Sponsor
Key Personnel
Subaward institutions and key personnel
Proposal Start and End Dates
Proposal Title
CFDA #
Opportunity #
Total Request Budget Amount
Human Subjects (Y/N)
Animal Subjects (Y/N)
Human Stem Cells (Y/N)
Will any resources (funding, people, equipment, etc.) be used outside of the United States for this project? (Y/N)

*The extent of information pulled from a Cayuse 424 proposal and populated in SeRA is dependent on the specific application form pages being used by the relative opportunity # and the extent the application form pages have been completed at the time of linking.  If a Cayuse 424 proposal does NOT include the SF 424 RR and/or RR Other Project Information form pages then some project questions may not be populated on the PDRF.  Moreover, If a Cayuse 424 proposal does NOT include the RR Key Persons and/or RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages then some key personnel information, and/or the presence of subawards (as applicable) may not populate on the PDRF. 
Linking a Cayuse 424 Proposal at PDRF Initiation
1. From the Start Transaction screen of a PDRF, select Yes to the question ‘Do you want to link to a Cayuse application?’ A Cayuse Proposal ID field will then display.
2. From within the Cayuse proposal, click the   icon at the top of the page. A Proposal Information window will open which contains a 10 digit Proposal ID. Copy the Proposal ID number, and enter it in the ‘Cayuse Proposal ID’ field in the Start Transaction window in SeRA. Click Start.
3. The Cayuse linking wizard will run, and a series of windows will display to verify the information being pulled from Cayuse 424 and being pushed to the PDRF.  Once the wizard begins you cannot navigate backwards in the wizard.  However, you can click the X in the top right of the wizard window at any time to cancel the wizard from running.
A. Verify Sponsor – Review that the sponsor listed in the ‘Push to PDRF’ column is the correct SeRA Sponsor. If yes, click Next.  If you are starting a Supplement PDRF, or Resubmission PDRF, it will also show what is currently on the PDRF in the ‘PDRF Sponsor’ column. 
Note, a message will display that the sponsor cannot be updated if the PDRF is in a stage where the sponsor field is not editable.          
B. Verify Personnel - Personnel listed on the Cayuse proposal’s RR Key Persons form page that have an associated SUNet ID will show in the Verify Personnel window.  Some roles will default to the associated SeRA PDRF role. For all others, select the role from the drop-down so they can be properly set in SeRA.  Verify the department for each individual is correct and change as needed. De-select the ‘Push to PDRF’ column prior to continuing for any personnel that should not be listed on the PDRF.  Click Next.
Note, if your Cayuse 424 proposal does NOT include the RR Key Persons form page personnel information entered in the Cayuse 424 proposal will not be pulled from Cayuse and pushed into the PDRF.  For these Cayuse 424 proposals you will need to enter the appropriate project personnel in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.
C. Verify Subawards – Any subawards listed on the Cayuse 424 proposal’s RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages will show in the Verify Subawards window. For each subaward institution identified in Cayuse search and select the appropriate subaward institution to be pushed to SeRA. Click Next.
Note, if your Cayuse 424 proposal does NOT include the RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages and/or if these pages are not being utilized in your Cayuse 424 proposal [such as in the case of NIH modular budget proposals] subaward information entered in the Cayuse 424 proposal will not be pulled from Cayuse and pushed into the PDRF.  For these Cayuse 424 proposals you will need to enter the appropriate subaward information in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.
D. Verify Project Info - Additional project information will pull from the Cayuse application and show here. If you are starting a Supplement PDRF or Resubmission PDRF, the window will also show what is currently on the PDRF in the ‘PDRF Data’ column. Click Finish.
Note, for Cayuse 424 proposals that do not include the SF 424 RR and/or RR Other Project Information form pages minimal project information will flow from Cayuse to SeRA.  For these proposals you will need to enter most project information in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.
4. Once the linking wizard is finished you can see, delete, and refresh the Cayuse link on the SeRA PDRF on the Admin & Sponsor Details page. The blue Cayuse 424 Proposal ID # is a direct link to the relative proposal within Cayuse. The presence of the link can also be viewed within Cayuse on both the Proposals List Screen as well as within the relative proposal.
Note, the direct link will only work for those that already have been granted permission to the relative Cayuse 424 proposal and/or have central office Cayuse access.

At any point during the PDRF transaction before it is completed the PDRF assignee can on the SeRA PDRF on the Admin & Sponsor Details page click the trash can icon to delete a Cayuse link or click Refresh to refresh the link between the PDRF and the Cayuse application. Clicking Refresh will trigger the linking wizard to run again and will update or notify you to update data elements that have changed since the last time the wizard ran.

A. Verify Sponsor - In this example there is no change in the sponsor. Click Next.
B. Verify Personnel - In this example a new Key Person has been added to the Cayuse 424 proposal. Review, edit the role and department as needed, check or uncheck if this person should be pushed to the PDRF, and click Next.
C. Verify Subawards - In this example there has been no change to the subaward listed on the Cayuse 424 proposal and already on the PDRF.  Thus, we will leave the ‘Push to PDRF’ box unchecked.  Click Next.
Note, if the ‘Push to PDRF’ box were checked in this example the result would be two duplicate UC Berkeley subaward entries on the Budget Questions page of the PDRF.
D. Verify Project Info - In this example the PoP dates, title, total requested budget amount, and animal subjects information has been changed in the Cayuse 424 proposal. The linking wizard identifies where the Cayuse 424 proposal and PDRF are no longer matching and indicates for which fields the PDRF is being system updated and for which fields the PDRF assignee will need to manually update the PDRF or Cayuse. Click Finish and proceed with making any needed manual PDRF and/or Cayuse updates.
Linking a Cayuse 424 Proposal to an Existing PDRF
1. From the Admin & Sponsor Details page of a PDRF select Cayuse 424 as the submission method and click Link Cayuse Application.

2. The Link Cayuse Application window will open.  From within the Cayuse proposal, click the  icon at the top of the page.  A Proposal Information window will open which contains a 10 digit Proposal ID.  Copy the Proposal ID number, and enter it in the ‘Cayuse Proposal ID’ field in the Link Cayuse Application window in SeRA and click Link.


3. The Cayuse linking wizard will run, and a series of windows will display to verify the information being pulled from Cayuse 424, compare it to what is already in the PDRF, and indicate for which fields the PDRF is being system updated and for which fields the PDRF assignee will need to manually update the PDRF or Cayuse. Once the wizard begins you cannot navigate backwards in the wizard. However, you can click the X in the top right of the wizard window at any time to cancel the wizard from running.
A. Verify Sponsor – Review that the sponsor listed in the ‘Push to PDRF’ column is the correct SeRA Sponsor. If yes, click Next.  If no, edit as needed, and click Next.
Note, a message will display that the sponsor cannot be updated if the PDRF is in a stage where the sponsor field is not editable. 
B. Verify Personnel - Personnel listed on the Cayuse proposal’s RR Key Persons form page that have an associated SU Net ID will show in the Verify Personnel window and are compared against key personnel already listed on the PDRF.  For personnel being pulled from Cayuse, some roles will default to the associated SeRA PDRF role. For all others, select the role from the drop-down so they can be properly set in SeRA.  Verify the department for each individual is correct and change as needed. De-select the ‘Push to PDRF’ column prior to continuing for those personnel that should not be listed on the PDRF.  Click Next.
Note, if your Cayuse 424 proposal does not include the RR Key Persons form page personnel information entered in the Cayuse 424 proposal will not be pulled from Cayuse and pushed into the PDRF.  For these Cayuse 424 proposals you will need to enter the appropriate project personnel in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.
C. Verify Subawards – The linking wizard will compare subawards already entered on the PDRF with any subawards listed on the Cayuse 424 proposal’s RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages. For each subaward institution identified in Cayuse that is NOT already on the PDRF search and select the appropriate subaward institution to be pushed to SeRA. In the below example, the subaward already entered on the PDRF is the same one as the one on the Cayuse 424 proposal.  Thus, we will leave the ‘Push to PDRF’ box unchecked. If the ‘Push to PDRF’ box were checked in this example the result would be two duplicate UC Berkeley subaward entries on the Budget Questions page of the PDRF. Click Next.
Note, if your Cayuse 424 proposal does not include the RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages and/or if these pages are not being utilized in your Cayuse 424 proposal [such as in the case of NIH modular budget proposals] subaward information entered in the Cayuse 424 proposal will not be pulled from Cayuse and pushed into the PDRF.  For these Cayuse 424 proposals you will need to enter the appropriate subaward information in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.D. Verify Project Info - The linking wizard will compare project information already entered on the PDRF with that which is listed on the Cayuse 424 proposal’s SF 424 RR and/or RR Other Project Information form pages, and indicates for which fields the PDRF is being system updated and for which fields the PDRF assignee will need to manually update the PDRF or Cayuse.  In the below example the PoP dates, title, and total requested budget amount in the Cayuse 424 proposal differs from what is in the PDRF.  Click Finish and proceed with making any needed manual PDRF and/or Cayuse updates.Note, for Cayuse 424 proposals that do not include the SF 424 RR and/or RR Other Project Information form pages minimal project information will flow from Cayuse to SeRA.  For these proposals you will need to enter most project information in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.  Additionally, for supplement proposals the linking wizard will never overwrite the PDRF title with the Cayuse title, as the existing title in SeRA takes precedence over supplement submissions.

Research Systems,Cayuse Incoming Subawards Guide,"Stanford Electronic Research Administration

Cayuse 424 – Incoming Subaward Quick Guide: Stanford will Receive a Subcontract
Scenario #1: Stanford will be issued a subcontract, the pass through institution uses Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs.
We will create a standalone subaward proposal within Cayuse, export the proposal and send it to the pass through institution via email. The pass though institution will then import our subaward proposal into their prime proposal.
1. Navigate to Cayuse 424 from SeRA https://sera.stanford.edu.

2. From the Cayuse landing page click Create Proposal.

3. A Create Proposal dialog box will open.Click the Research Subaward Proposal radio button. Click Create.

4. A Create New Subaward dialog box will open. 

Enter a name for the subaward.
Select Stanford as the Organization from the dropdown menu.
Select the default IDC rate (most often On Campus_Organized Research). Cayuse proposals can support multiple IDC rates, so if you need multiple rates for your proposal (i.e. both on and off campus etc.) select the one you will use the most here. You can add the additional rates from within the budget pages of the proposal
Select the number of budget periods for the proposal.
Select the sponsor due date.
Select the validation type. If you do not see the prime federal sponsor to which you are applying in the drop down list, select “Other Federal Agency”.
Click Create Subaward.

5. Your newly created sub proposal will open to the first page of the budget form. The budget form will default to the RR Fed NonFed Budget type. If you are applying to a program that does not require a NonFed component leave all NonFed fields blanks.

6. Once you have completed the subaward proposal click the export icon, either in the upper right or on the left-hand navigation menu.

7. You will be navigated to the Proposal Export page. Click Validate to ensure your subaward proposal conforms to the selected sponsor.

8. Click Export and save the .cayuse file somewhere convenient. You can then attach this file to an email to send to your pass through institution for them to import into their prime Cayuse proposal.
For additional detailed guidance:
Cayuse 424 Comprehensive User Guide
Scenario #2: Stanford will be issued a subcontract, the pass through institution does NOT use Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs.

Option #1: We request that the flow through institution extract the subaward pages of the proposal from Grants.gov Workspace as PDFs, send them to us for completion, we complete them and return them for uploading into their Workspace prime proposal.  For more information about this click here.
Option #2: We provide the pass through institution with the requisite information and attachments for them to complete the subaward pages within their own Grants.gov Workspace prime proposal.

*For federal submissions to opportunities that do NOT require detailed budget pages from subs, it is typically most efficient to provide the PTE the information they need to complete their prime proposal via email.

A consistent naming strategy is valuable in helping us to maintain an organized environment. Everyone can find the right teams easier, and we’ll avoid unnecessary duplicates.
Microsoft Teams naming prefixes
By starting names with a short prefix, we ensure everyone sees this key information immediately.
In the Stanford University tenant, the names of all Microsoft Teams start with the standard prefix ""SU-Group-” by default.
The prefix is added automatically added to the name when the Team is created. The rest of the Team name needs to be entered manually by the person who is creating the Team.
Naming guidelines for Teams
When creating a new Microsoft Team, please apply the following naming convention:
SU-Group-{Organization or School Name Prefix} {Department/Group}
Examples:
SU-Group-UIT Finance TeamSU-Group-UIT Comms Team
Team names should include something to identify your group or its purpose in the context of the university as a whole. For example, "" Finance Team"" would not be specific enough to differentiate your group from the many other finance teams around the university. ""UIT Finance Team"" would be more helpful.
Teams created with names that don't follow these guidelines may be renamed.
Notes about naming
A space or underscore is allowed between fields within the name.The following special characters are not allowed: ~ "" # % & * : < > ? / \ { | }.Team names cannot exceed 64 characters.Ensure you're using a unique public name when creating the Team."

Audio & Video Conferencing,FAQs: Teams Guest Member Experience,"On this page:
Getting startedUnderstanding guest and tenant accessChatPlanner, Whiteboard, OneDrive, and other M365 apps
Review these FAQs to learn more about how to work with guest members in Teams.
Getting started
Q:Can you elaborate on what cross-affiliate collaboration in Teams means?
Each of the three Stanford Medicine Affiliates maintains and manages its own separate M365 tenant. To share data across Stanford Medicine, each affiliate may invite guests from the other affiliates to join their Teams tenant.
Q: Can PHI/PII be shared in Teams?
PHI (patient medical record information) and PII (staff Human Resources data) will be allowed to be shared for collaboration efforts across Stanford Medicine. Your access to Teams and other Microsoft 365 applications, including Stanford University email, will be limited to devices with a Cardinal Key starting Aug. 31, 2023.

Understanding tenants and guest access
Q: What is a Microsoft tenant?A tenant is an application available to a specific group of users and typically associated with a domain name, such as @stanford.edu or @stanfordhealthcarte.org. In Microsoft, Stanford University, Stanford Health Care, and Stanford Children's Health each maintain their tenant.Q: What does it mean to be a guest? At Stanford University, a guest is someone who doesn’t have a SUNet ID or a Stanford University Microsoft account. The individual becomes a guest once invited to join a team in the Stanford University tenant and accepts the email invitation to activate their guest account. You will be able to collaborate with colleagues in the health systems as guests in the Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children’s Health platforms as well as with collaborators outside of Stanford who have Microsoft Teams available in their institution.Q: What does it mean to be an external user in Teams? External access lets people in other organizations chat and call you. You cannot add a person with external access to a Team unless you add them as a guest.Q: I am in the School of Medicine and see Stanford in my organization picker, but I don't see Stanford Health Care or Children's Health Care in my list. What should I do? To see organizations you may access as a guest in your organization-picker list, you must first receive a chat or an invite to a Teams' team from someone at that organization.  Here’s how it works.
You will receive an email notifying you of a waiting chat message or Teams team invite. To accept the invite, click the link in the email.If you have previously selected ""open these links in Teams, "" Microsoft will redirect you to your desktop Teams client version.Go back to the browser window behind the desktop client window. You should see your guest chat there. If the guest organization does not show up, you may need to log out and log back into Teams. You may have to do this several times. 
Q: I invited a healthcare colleague to be a guest on my team in the Stanford University tenant, but the option to log in as a guest account is missing from their Teams application. What happened? When you invite a collaborator to be a guest member in the Stanford University tenant, Microsoft will email them an invite if they have not worked in the tenant before. The collaborator must accept the invite to switch to their guest account. Learn more about working with external guests.
If the guest member accepts the invite but doesn’t see the option to switch tenants when they click on their profile in the upper right corner, they may need to restart their computers and attempt to accept the invite again.If the recipient misses the invite, they will not be added to the team as a guest. You will not receive feedback that the chat or Teams team site invite has not been accepted. The best solution is to ask your collaborator to check their inbox and accept the invite.If the collaborator has accepted the invite but does not see the option to switch to their guest account, ask them to restart their computer and accept the invite again.
Q: Is the presence indicator tenant-specific?Yes, the presence indicator is tenant-specific. Wherever you see someone’s profile, such as tagging them in a channel thread or trying to chat with them, you’ll see if they are online in your tenant. If they’re not online in your tenant and you need to reach them quickly, it may be best to message the external user outside of Teams.Q: How does a guest know what Microsoft tenant they are in? They should see the tenant selected in the upper right in the organization picker. A tenant is an application available to a specific group of users and typically associated with an organization and domain name, such as @stanford.edu or @stanfordhealthcarte.org. Learn more about the guest experience.Q: Some of my collaborators have both a SUNet ID and a hospital ID. Should I add them to my Team as full members (SUNet ID) or guests (hospital ID)? You can discuss this with your collaborators to determine the best answer. If your collaborators spend most of their time in the SHC or SCH tenants, they may prefer to be added as guests. But adding them as full members will make the experience more feature-rich. Q: Why do I see two entries for a colleague outside of Stanford University? You may see two entries for a user you've chatted with who has also been invited into a team at Stanford University as a guest. Choosing the (External) user may be the best way to chat or call with that individual since the guest member may not be signed into the Stanford University tenant. The guest member option may be better if the guest must participate in team meetings, document sharing, and extended multi-person team channel conversations. Q: How do I know if I’m adding a Stanford University member or a guest member to my Team?In the Stanford University tenant, (SHC)(Guest) or (SCH)(Guest) will appear after the names of those with an active hospital affiliation in the Team’s directory.Q: Can I invite someone outside of the Stanford university or health systems domains to be a guest in the Stanford University tenant?Anyone at the university can invite a guest user from any domain. (i.e. @gmail.com) Once that user accepts the invite, they could then be added to a Teams team as a guest. The difference is that everyone at SHC and SCH already has a guest account created for them in the university tenant.
Chat
Q: When I send a chat message in Teams, will guest members receive a notification? When you send a chat message in Teams, notifications are sent to everyone working in the tenant — including guests. However, no message will be displayed for guests not currently active in the tenant. What guests do get is the same as if they missed a notification in their account: an email summarizing that a notification is waiting for them that arrives about an hour later. They also get a notification waiting for them in their Activity tab the next time they manually log in to the relevant account. However, knowing that guest members will only see a chat when they are signed into the Stanford University tenant, it may be best to limit conversations to file collaborations and non-urgent matters.Q: Someone sent me a chat in Teams, but I didn’t see any notification for it and missed their message.   How can I prevent this from happening again?There are a few ways you can help to ensure you won’t miss chat messages.
Be sure you have notifications turned on. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner (your initials in a circle) and select More options (three dots). Select settings, then privacy. In the Windows and Mac desktop applications for Teams, notifications are not shown for messages from another organization’s Microsoft 365 tenant, so you can use a browser window or the mobile app for Teams. For the mobile app on your iPhone, the notifications from all guests at Teams in other organization locations will show an alert, although there may be a delay. You may go into settings in the Teams app on your phone to turn the sound on or off for Teams notifications. For a browser window, open in a supported browser and navigate to Teams.office.com and sign in if required. Once the Teams app is open, go to your name icon (circle with your initials) in the top right corner and select the guest organization from the drop-down list. Use the incognito window. If you want an additional organization’s guest windows to open, you may use a private incognito window. (Note that is impossible for SHC users due to Conditional Access sign-in requirements).
Q: Is there any easy way for guest members to work in their home tenant but still be available to join group chats across tenants? Chatting as a guest requires you to switch your view to the guest account. When you switch tenants in your main desktop app, you can no longer see chats and data in your home tenant. As a workaround, many people keep a browser or mobile app open in the other tenant while keeping the desktop app open in their home tenant. Then they can participate in both at the same time.Q: I received an email saying that I have a chat from someone at a different organization, but when I click the link, it takes me to my own organization’s Teams chats. What should I do? When you click a link to open a chat or file in Teams, it will try to open the correct file or chat but defaults to opening Teams from the organization where you last authenticated. For example, if you last chatted with someone from SHC, Teams will open to SHC Teams. Here’s what you can do to find the message or file you want: Use the organization picker (by clicking your profile icon in the upper right corner) and select the organization (tenant) where the message originated. (For example, if you receive an email notification from an SMCH colleague, Stanford Children's Health (Guest)). Once you have switched tenants, click the link in the email notification or select the activity bell at the top left corner of the Teams screen.Q: How do I add someone from Stanford Medicine to a team or chat if I don't see the name I am looking in the Teams directory? Stanford University members may choose to have their name to be hidden from the Teams directory (Global Address List). You can add their name by entering the person's full email address, i.e., janestanford@stanford.edu.Q: How do I start a chat with an external user if I don’t see their name in the directory? Start a new chat, and enter the external user’s full email address. You will see an option to “search externally” for the user. Once the user is found, you can chat, call and see the external user’s availability (presence) information. Learn more about working with external guests.Q: How do I add someone external to Stanford to a team? Open the Teams' team, then select ""add member"" in the three dots next to the name of the Teams' team at the top of the channel names list on the left.  Enter the person's full email address. For example, ""Jane@Duke.org"" The recipient will receive an email from Microsoft with a link to access the Teams' team at Stanford. Learn more about working with external guests. Learn more about how to add members to a team.
Planner, Whiteboard, OneDrive, and other M365 apps
Q: I want to add a guess from another organization to my Microsoft Whiteboard, but I can't find their names in the drop down ""people picker"" list.  What is the issue? Microsoft has not enabled Whiteboard for cross-organization collaboration. However, you can use the app for whiteboarding activities across the School of Medicine or use the Whiteboard in a meeting while showing your screen.Q: I do not see the ""+"" symbol to add an application (Planner, Wiki Notes, SharePoint Lists, etc.) to a Teams' team channel. Why is that? Only team owners can add applications and change the configuration of a Teams team.Q: I shared a Word document from my OneDrive to a guest at another Stanford Medicine organization. Why is he being required to sign into Teams each time he want to open the file? You can avoid this issue by granting access. This option ensures that only the individual you specify will be added to a list of people with direct access to the file and avoids the known issue requiring Stanford Medicine Affiliates to re-login to M365 after clicking a shareable link for file sharing in Teams. Here's how:
Click the More option (three dots) next to the document in the document library view (list of documents) and select ""Manage access"" from the menu of options.Click the blue ""+"" symbol to the right of ""Direct access.""Select the guest's name from the drop-down list or enter the guest's full email address.  When you are done, click “Grant access.”
Q: I am a guest in a Teams' team hosted at SHC. My SHC colleagues can edit a file in the document library but I cannot. What should I do?SHC has sharing policies for documents automatically matched with PHI or PII data and labeled as ""High Risk."" Stanford Medicine users can view but not edit the files. You may ask one of the team members from SHC to change the file label to ""Secure"" so that you may edit the file. ​Tip: If the team has a mixed membership of Stanford Medicine guests and guests from other organizations, it is best practice to move documents into a private channel only accessible by guests from organizations trusted for collaborating with PHI."

General questions about the Microsoft 365General questions about the Teams platformMaking Teams work for youFiles and file storageTroubleshooting common issues in TeamsDisabling automatic Teams meeting links
Below is a list of common questions about Microsoft Teams. General questions about the Microsoft 365Q: What is M365? Is it the same as Office? Office 365 (O365) has become Microsoft 365 (M365) a cloud-powered platform that includes a suite of desktop, web, and mobile apps and services for collaboration and productivity.Q: How do Teams, OneDrive, Teams, and SharePoint work together?SharePoint is Microsoft's online storage platform. Every SharePoint site has its library of documents. SharePoint is also the backbone for OneDrive and Teams. OneDrive is essentially a personal SharePoint site. Every Teams site is also a SharePoint site. Think of Teams as an interface or “wrapping” that sits over SharePoint to combine SharePoint's file storage with other features like chat.General questions about the Teams platformQ: What are Teams? Teams are collections of people, content, and tools that center around different projects and jobs within an organization.  Q: What is a channel? Channels let individuals on a Team have conversations about specific topics. Every team has its own set of channels. Except for guests, any team member can create a new channel. Each channel belonging to a team is completely public to all the team members and guests, so everyone can feel free to join in a channel conversation. However, it is possible to create a private channel.Q: How do I know if I should create a new team or channel? If your new project involves working with all the same people who are in your current Team, it might be best to create a new channel instead. If you need a private space for a certain group, you can create a private channel and invite only those people. Often, it's more effective to create a new channel rather than creating an entirely new team. However, if you need a more robust workspace beyond the capabilities of a channel, you can create an entirely new team workspace and invite new team members.Q: Is there a naming convention for Teams? While there is no formal convention, we encourage you to follow Stanford University's naming policy. Adopting a consistent naming approach helps ensure others can easily understand who owns your team and its purpose.Q: What’s the difference between team channels and private chats? While channel conversations are public, chats are just between you and someone else (or a group).Q: Can I collaborate in the Teams platform if I’m not on a Team? Microsoft Teams can be used without a Team for direct messaging, video, and voice calling. Anyone at Stanford University with a full-service or sponsored full-service SUNet ID can request a Microsoft Teams team to collaborate with a group of people.Q: How is Teams different than Slack or Zoom? You can use these tools to chat, call, or videoconference. Slack and Zoom are the university’s preferred collaboration tools, but Teams is a good option for certain use cases. Teams can be used for cross-affiliate collaboration, such as with individuals in the hospitals and clinics. Q: What is the difference between the role of owner and member of a team? Owner and member are the two user roles within Microsoft Teams. The user who creates a new team is granted owner status by default. When interacting with a team and its channels, owners and members have different permissions and capabilities.Q: How do I know which conversations include me? If you're worried about knowing when someone in a conversation needs your attention, keep an eye on your Activity feed. You'll get a notification whenever someone:
	@mentions you@mentions teams and channels you belong toReplies to conversations you're part ofReplies to your replies
	Making Teams work for youQ: Can I view my stanford.edu or stanfordhealthcare.org email accounts from the Teams interface? Unfortunately, there is no direct access to email accounts. The email app requires webmail or an email client like Outlook.Q: How do I change my notifications so messages don’t pop up on my screen during meetings? You can manage notifications by clicking the more actions (three dots) in the top right and selecting Settings>Notifications. For more info, refer to Manage notifications in Teams.Q: How do I add someone to a private chat? To loop someone into a private conversation, click the Add people icon in the upper right corner of your screen. Enter the name of the person you’d like to add and select Enter.Q: Where do I find my recordings? Depending upon the type of meeting, there are multiple places to share. To learn more, visit How to play and share a meeting recording.Q: How do I share a meeting recording with individuals who didn’t participate in the meeting? If you recorded or organized the meeting, you can share it with people who weren't invited to the meeting—by sharing it like you would share any other file. Just find the file in OneDrive or SharePoint and share it directly with people or copy a link and share it however you like. If you weren't the person who recorded or organized the meeting, you could still share the recording with people who weren't invited. However, the meeting organizer or the meeting recorder must approve your share action before those people get access.Q: Can I add a colleague with a healthcare ID to my team? Yes, employees of Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children’s Health are identified in the university’s Team’s directory as (Guests). See the Teams Guest Experience to learn more.Q: The initials in my Teams profile aren't displaying how I'd like. Do I have the option to edit the initials I want to use? The initials of the Teams profile are based on your user display name and cannot be modified. However, you do have the option to upload a new profile image if you'd like. (You can always upload an image of your preferred initials as your profile photo.)Q: How do I easily find my most commonly used contacts and chats? You can pin up to 15 contacts or chats to make them easy to find. Here’s how: Find the favorite contact or chat in recent chats, hover over the name, and click More options (three dots). Select the pin option, and they’ll appear in a pinned list at the top of your chats.Q: In Teams, where do I find the files and folders I upload to a channel or share in a chat?Each team has its own site in SharePoint. The same files and folders can be accessed from either Teams or SharePoint. Files you upload to a channel are stored in your team's SharePoint folder. These files are available in the Files tab at the top of each channel in Teams. Files you upload to a one-on-one or group chat are stored in your OneDrive and shared only with the people in that conversation. These are available in the Files tab at the top of a chat.Q:How do I easily search for files and other information shared in Teams? There are several ways to find what you need in Teams. When you type a word or name, Teams will show related results. Choose one of the suggested items or press Enter for a full list. You can also press Ctrl+F (cmd+F on macOS) to search messages within a particular chat or channel in Teams. Choose the area you want to search—for example, a recent chat or the General channel within a team. Press Ctrl+F followed by your search terms, and then press Enter. The search results will be displayed from within that chat or channel conversation. Refer to Search for messages and more in Teams. Files and file storageQ: Where are the files I add to a channel stored? The backend site for a Team is a SharePoint site. Files you upload to a channel are stored in your team's SharePoint folder. These files are available in the Files tab at the top of each channel.Q: Where are the files I upload to chat stored? The backend site for a Chat is OneDrive. When you add files to a one-on-one Chat, your file is stored in your OneDrive and shared only with those in that conversation. Q: Where do I upload files to be shared with my team? If you have any structured file format for your Teams, it’s better to avoid uploading files to chats. Doing this will cause files to appear at the bottom of the general Files tab instead of in their proper folder. (Loose files can still be moved to the correct folder location afterward, but it’s an extra step) 
	Instead, go into Teams > Files, find the correct folder (or create one), and upload the file. You can then select Copy link to share the file in chat or channel conversations.  
	Q: How do I share my files to OneDrive or SharePoint?
	If you are working on the file by yourself, save it to OneDrive. Your OneDrive files are private to you unless you share them with others.  If you’re working as a team, you should save your files where your team works. 
	Troubleshooting common issues in TeamsQ: I found a colleague at SHC in the Teams directory and sent them a chat. However, they didn’t receive it. How come? You cannot send a chat to a colleague in another tenant unless that person has accepted the chat or been added to a Team.Q: How do I join a Teams meeting from Safari? By default, you cannot join a Teams meeting from Safari, but by changing the settings, you should be able to. You must download the Microsoft Teams app in advance to join the meeting via mobile device.Q: I can no longer access a folder in Teams. What could be the issue? It’s possible that the file or folder name was changed in SharePoint. Remember, any SharePoint file name or location changes must also be changed in Teams. However, changes to files in Teams should automatically update both Teams and SharePoint.Q: The Teams add-in doesn’t appear on my Outlook desktop app calendar view. What should I do? If you don’t see the New Teams Meeting icon in the desktop version of Outlook, the Teams add-in for Outlook might not be installed properly.
	For automated troubleshooting, you can run the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant.To manually troubleshoot this problem, see Use the Teams Meeting add-in in Outlook.

	Disabling automatic Teams meeting linksQ: How do I prevent Outlook from automatically creating a Microsoft Teams meeting? When you schedule a meeting in Outlook, a Teams meeting link may automatically be added to the meeting request. This occurs even if you have set Zoom as your default preference if you are not signed into the Zoom integration when you schedule the meeting. If you do not want to schedule a Teams meeting in Outlook, you can disable this setting in by following the steps on How to Disable Teams Meeting Links.Q: Why did Outlook insert a Teams link into my meeting request when I've set Zoom as my default preference? You might need to refresh your Zoom integration SSO login by selecting either of the two Zoom menu items and logging in to stanford.zoom.us as prompted. Remember, Zoom authentication sessions expire, and you may need to re-authenticate to keep the Zoom preference intact.

Audio & Video Conferencing,Guest Member Experience in Teams,"On this page:
Stanford Affiliate colleagues are guestsJoining a team as a guestActivating the guest experienceTroubleshooting the guest experienceIdentifying guest members on a teamCapabilities comparisonLearn more
The guest experience in Microsoft Teams allows you to add individuals from outside your organization or affiliation to your Teams channels, enabling them to collaborate with your internal team members on projects and tasks. With that, you can use Teams to connect with colleagues from Stanford Health Care (SHC) and Stanford Medicine Children’s Health (SMCH) with similar ease as when collaborating within the university. This includes participating in chats and using SharePoint.
To learn more about the guest experience, review the guest experience FAQs.
Stanford Affiliate colleagues are guests

 
Guest members are those invited to join a team or channel in Teams from outside the organization or tenant. Stanford Affiliate colleagues are considered guests in the Stanford University tenant.  This is because the university, SHC, and SMCH each have coordinated but separately managed Microsoft tenants. If you are unfamiliar with the term “tenant,” think of it as a dedicated piece of the cloud that Microsoft provides to an organization to hold its data and other information.  Similarly, if you are invited to join a team in the SHC or SMCH tenant, you will collaborate as a guest.
To review the definition of tenant and other Microsoft terminology, refer to UIT’s Teams glossary.
Joining a Teams team as a guest
All Stanford Medicine Teams users will have one home tenant and automatically have guest access to the other Stanford Medicine tenants. To see Teams tenants from other organizations you can access as a guest, you must first receive an invite to a Teams team or an invite to join a chat from someone at the organization.
When you are invited to join a team or a chat outside of your home tenant for the first time, you will receive an email notification email message from Microsoft.You can accept the invitation by clicking the link in the email. Once you sign into Teams using your home credentials, you will be directed to the Teams team's page in the guest tenant to view and access content, be added to channels within the team, and communicate with other team members.

Activating the guest experience
When people become guests on a team, they will see their guest account in the organization picker when they click their profile picture/initial icon in the top right corner of the Teams client or Teams on the web.  The picker lists all organizations to which the individual has a guest account plus their home tenant — and lets them toggle between different organizations.   
Changing an organization will enable the individual to activate the guest experience as a guest member in another tenant. 

Troubleshooting the guest experience
If you are trying to join a Microsoft Teams guest tenant using an invite link and the link does not take you to a new tenant, try this:
Sign out of your Teams account. Sign out of your Microsoft account and then sign back in. Allow time for the guest tenant to appear. It may take up to 24 hours to see the guest tenant appear in the organizational picker.Retry the process. You may need to repeat these steps more than once. 
Identifying guest members on a team
All team members see a message in the channel thread announcing the team has a guest member. A (Guest) label appears next to the name of each guest member, and a tag in the upper-right corner of the channel thread indicates the number of guests on the team.


Capabilities comparison
Guest members don’t have all the capabilities of those with a SUNet ID — but they have access to team chats, meetings, documents, and files shared within certain team channels. However, to access those files or chat conversations, guests must enable the guest experience by being logged into the Stanford University tenant.

If you encounter any problems connecting to a room system, contact your local IT support for help."
Audio & Video Conferencing,How do I join a Zoom meeting from a video conferencing system? (Legacy),"In most conference rooms, Zoom is already programmed into the room system as a Favorite. While room panel systems vary, follow a process similar to the following to join a Zoom meeting:

From a video conferencing panel, find where the Zoom or Zoom Conferencing option is saved on the system. It is likely under Contacts or Call.
From the list of Favorites, touch the Zoom option.
From the Zoom dialog box, touch Call.The room system will dial into Zoom.
On the screen, touch Keypad.The keypad will appear.
On the keypad, type # meeting ID number #.
You are connected to the meeting.

 
If Zoom is not saved as a Favorite in the video conferencing panel, follow these instructions:

From a video conferencing system panel, touch Dial.
On the dial screen, touch the keyboard icon to the bottom right.
Using the keyboard, type the video address in the format meet@zoomcrc.com.
Touch Call.
On the screen, touch Keypad.
On the keypad, type # meeting ID number #
You are connected to the meeting.

Troubleshooting
You might receive an error message when attempting to join a meeting from a conference room.
This message indicates that the room system is not encrypted thus you will not be able to join the Zoom meeting using that room system.
To protect Stanford data, including video content, Stanford Zoom requires that all devices participating in a Zoom video conference have encryption turned on. That’s automatic for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, but not always true of room systems.
If you encounter any problems connecting to a room system, contact your local IT support for help setting up encryption on the system. Alternatively, you can use Stanford's WebEx service to connect to that room."
Audio & Video Conferencing,Zoom Tips and Tricks,"Scheduling in Zoom

Set up a Personal Meeting ID (PMI): Like BlueJeans, Zoom lets you set up a Personal Meeting ID that lets you have a meeting without scheduling it in advance. For information, see the Zoom Help Center: Schedule with Personal Meeting ID (PMI).
Create recurring meetings: To create a new series of recurring meetings in Zoom, go to Schedule a Meeting and check the Recurring meeting box. You can then customize your occurrences. Add the new recurring meeting information to your calendar invitations.
Use the Zoom Outlook plugin: Zoom's Microsoft Outlook plugin lets you schedule your Zoom meetings directly in your Outlook calendar. For more information, see the Zoom Help Center: How to Use the Microsoft Outlook Plugin.
Assign a different person as the meeting host: The alternative host function lets you schedule a meeting and assign another person as a host. This function is only available when you schedule a meeting through the web portal (stanford.zoom.us).
Schedule a meeting for another person: To schedule a meeting on someone else's behalf, see the Zoom Help Center: What is Scheduling Privilege?
Schedule concurrent meetings: A single host can schedule up to five concurrent meetings as long as they do not use their Personal Meeting ID (PMI) to schedule the meetings.

Using room systems

Join Zoom from a room system: Follow these steps to join a Zoom meeting from a room system.
Encrypt room systems: Stanford Zoom requires that all devices participating in a Zoom video conference have encryption turned on. That’s automatic for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, but not always true for room systems. If Zoom participants use a non-UIT supported room system, it is best to test the connection before the meeting. If you have trouble connecting to a room system, contact your local IT support for help setting up encryption on the system, or use Stanford's WebEx service when connecting to that room.

Audio & Video Conferencing,How to check your WiFi network stability during a Zoom call,"With more staff working at home, some are experiencing network congestion as roommates, spouses, and children are all using bandwidth. If you notice latency in your video conferencing calls, please check your home WiFi bandwidth before assuming the problem is related to Zoom.
To check your bandwidth, follow these steps:

While in the Zoom call, click the caret (^) next to the Start/Stop Video button.
Select Video Settings...
When a new window appears, select Statistics.
Review the following information:

Check the Overall bandwidth. Normally it should be within 750kbps+. Note: Bandwidth is a dynamic number, and if there is a less motion a lower bandwidth is normal.
Check the Audio to ensure that it is less than 1% packet loss.
Check the Video to ensure that it is less than 1% packet loss.



If you have a bandwidth issue that is affecting your Zoom call, try these steps:

Leave the meeting then rejoin it.
Reboot your computer.
Reboot your WiFi router.
Try to join the meeting from your mobile device on a cellular network, rather than WiFi.
Turn video off or change your profile to a static photo. Learn how to customize your profile in Zoom.
Have Zoom call your cell phone for audio.

For more tips on managing bandwidth, visit How to Access Applications and Services Faster When You Work from Home.
If you still have issues after troubleshooting, please submit a Help ticket to Zoom. Be sure to provide this information in your ticket:

As long as students have not yet submitted assignments, you can temporarily unpublish the Canvas course to make edits, then republish.
Try to make these edits before the course starts or early on in the quarter, before students start submitting work. If it is too late for that, and students are complaining of too much email, another option is to let students know they can change the Calendar notification to a reduced frequency or turn it off under Account > Notifications."
Audio & Video Conferencing,How to Join a Zoom Meeting by Phone,"Changes to how you join a Zoom meeting by phone
On April 16, 2020, UIT changed a default Zoom setting to further protect your meetings from unwanted participants. If you add a numeric password to your meeting, participants joining by phone must enter that same password (if you edit your password to make it alphanumeric, a numeric version will be autogenerated for your meeting invite*).
Participants who join the meeting via app but want to join the audio by phone should select the Call Me option to avoid entering the Zoom phone number, meeting number, or password as they would have to if they dialed in (This option is called Call My Phone on mobile app). Participants who need to join exclusively by phone will need an Outlook invite sent to them.
Canvas Users Note:

Clicking the meeting link you find in the Canvas Calendar, or Zoom tool, will launch the app on your desktop or phone and log you in with an embedded password. You can join internet audio, however, if your phone signal is better the Call Me method will help participants avoid the need to type in the password if they’ve successfully connected to the meeting.
If students can’t connect to the meeting to begin with, instructors will need to share the Stanford call in number and meeting password because the Canvas Zoom tool doesn’t display the Zoom phone numbers and password for meetings to students. It only displays a meeting number and link to connect to meetings with an embedded password in the URL.

As long as it is numeric, the phone password is the same as the meeting password the host sees as they create or edit a meeting in Zoom.
However, if the password was edited to include non-numeric characters, you can only find the numeric phone password by clicking the meeting at https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting and opening the Outlook invite.

Why can't I log into Finesse?
Ensure you are logged in to Jabber or your desk phone, before you log in to Finesse. If trouble still persists, you may have forgotten to sign out of another device. Finesse only allows your user id to be logged in to one device at a time. 




Can Finesse automatically place us in a Not Ready state when making an outbound call?
The UIT Team is exploring this possibility and will provide a response after thorough testing on this function. 




Can I save my password for Finesse in the program?
Due to security policies, you are unable to save your password in Finesse. Depending on your browser, prompts may be different, you can store your password and then only have to enter your extension to log in. 




Where does the clock in Finesse pull the time from?
The time in Finesse is pulled from a dedicated server for the phone system. The time that that you log in to the system will be automatically recorded by the server. The time that you log in is not impacted by the clock on your laptop. 




Can we add contacts to the phone book in Finesse?
To add a contact to the Finesse phone book, your supervisor will need to submit a ticket to the UIT Service Desk. Phone books in Finesse are shared by teams, so any changes to a phone book will be visible to the whole team and as such, should be applicable to the whole team. For individual extensions or personal contacts you may add contacts thru the ""Contacts"" feature in Jabber. 




If I am using the Consult feature in Finesse and retrieve one line, will it automatically put the other line on hold?
Yes. While using the consult feature in Finesse users have the ability to alternate between two calls. When on an active call, retrieving the call on hold will automatically place your other call on hold. 




What do I do if I can't log into Finesse at the start of my shift to record my time at the start of the day?
First, email your supervisor to inform them you are here and unable to log in. For help resolving this technical issue, contact the UIT Service Desk. 




Will I be able to switch between using Finesse and my desk phone on a call?
We recommend that you use Finesse for all call management however, you may choose to use your desk phone to answer a call , place a call on hold or perform a transfer. NOTE: You must be logged into Finesse with your desk phone extension in order to use the phone for contact center call activities. 




How will I get notification of a new incoming call through Finesse? What if I don't have the window up-will there be a pop-up?
If you are using Finesse with a desk phone, you will not see a pop-up, but your desk phone or headset will ring. If you are using Finesse with a desk phone, Jabber extension, there will be a pop-up window in Jabber when you receive a call. You will also hear a ringing on your headset. 




Will I be able to see my call log in Finesse?
Call logs are not visible in Finesse, however, call logs are available in Jabber and on your desk phone. 




What do I do if I am on a call in Finesse and I accidentally close my browser window?
If you are on a call and accidentally close your browser, you will remain on the call, but will have to use Jabber or your desk phone, as applicable, for further call control activities. When done with the call, log back in to Finesse as soon as possible. 




Where do I manage my current state (e.g. ready, not ready, etc...)? Can I manage it thru both my desk phone and Finesse?
All contact center state management is supported thru Finesse. You must be logged into Finesse to take calls. You will no longer use your desk phone to log in/out and manage your state in queue. 


How can I save time when doing warm transfers?
When you are on the phone with the caller and you know that you will be transferring them, go ahead and press the ""Consult"" button in Finesse while you are still talking to them. This will bring up the keypad and you can then enter the phone number you want to transfer to and when you are ready to place the caller on ""hold"" and transfer them, simply select the ""Call"" button. This eliminates having 10 seconds of dead air before the hold music plays/transfer begins. REMEMBER - You can only make an outbound call from a ""Not Ready"" state. Select ""Not Ready-Outbound Call"" when placing an outbound call. REMEMBER - When you receive a direct call on your desk phone, change your status in Finesse to ""Not Ready"" so that you don't also receive a queue call. 




Is there a recommended way to make a Warm Transfer?
When you are on the phone with a caller and you know you will be transferring them, go ahead and hit the consult button in Finesse while you are still talking to them. This will bring up the keypad and you can then enter the phone number where you wish to connect them. When you are ready, place the caller on hold by hitting the call button. This eliminates having 10 seconds of dead air before the hold music begins. 




I can't see my Finesse phone book. Is there anything I can do?
You can switch between ""Home"" and ""Manage Calls"" from the Home page. If you are on the Home tab, switch to the Manage Calls tab by clicking ""Manage Calls"". If you are on the Manage Calls tab, switch to the Home tab by clicking ""Home"".  




Any quick ways to make calls, conference or transfer calls from Finesse?
If accessing a database to look up someone's number to place a call, you can copy the number from that database and paste the number into Finesse, using normal Windows commands. REMEMBER: Follow normal Stanford dialing instructions to reach a contact outside of Stanford."

Help & Ticketing Systems,How Do I Find a Person's Assignment Group(s) in ServiceNow?,"It is best practice to assign a ticket to an assignment group rather than an individual in ServiceNow. However, there are times when there is a legitimate reason to assign it directly to a person. There are a few different ways to find out someone's assignment group.
From the Informational ""I"" within a ticket

Within a ticket, enter the person's name in the Assigned to field.
Click the informational ""i"" button near the person's name.
When the user information displays, right click on ""Open Record"" and choose to open the record in a new tab.
From within the user record, scroll to the bottom and click on the ""Groups"" tab. This tab will show all the ServiceNow groups the person is a member of. 
Once you have identified the appropriate group, go back to the browser with the ticket and populate it in the ""Assignment Group"" field. 

From the Global Search

Type in the person's name in the global search field in the top right hand corner near your name.
On the right section of the UI, click the ""People - Users"" section and select the correct user to display their user record.
From within the user record, scroll to the bottom and click on the ""Groups"" tab. This tab will show all the ServiceNow groups the person is a member of. 
Once you have identified the appropriate group, go back to the browser with the ticket and populate it in the ""Assignment group"" field."

Help & Ticketing Systems,What Changes to Expect with the ServiceNow London Release,"ServiceNow will be upgraded to the London release on April 27, 2019. Fulfillers will not notice a significant difference but, the upgrade will introduce a few new features.

Dashboards (KB00016463)
Knowledge Blocks (KB00016454)
Knowledge Feedback Tasks (KB00016389)

Dashboards
Responsive dashboards are a great way to consolidate and share information with others. Content on the dashboard can be easily dragged and dropped to different locations, resized or tabs can be added to allow users to customize the dashboard to what suits their needs.
More information on Dashboards can be found in this article: Working with ServiceNow Dashboards (KB00016463) 
Knowledge Blocks
Knowledge Blocks allow Knowledge Contributors and Manager to create blocks of information that can be added to several different knowledge articles. One of the greatest benefits of this is it allows content to be updated in one place but, updated throughout all the articles that contain the block.
Knowledge Blocks are currently only being piloted for IT and the Finance,Payroll & Budgeting Domain Knowledge Bases at this time.

Help & Ticketing Systems,Calling all ServiceNow Group Managers — Save a License,"As a shared service used across Stanford, ServiceNow is offered to all campus units to help manage their community’s support requests. University IT funds the maintenance, support and enhancements to the platform as well as a pool of named licenses for the entire campus to share. ServiceNow charges Stanford every year for every license that is assigned to a person, even if the license is not being actively used. To be good stewards of Stanford’s resources, we are calling all service group managers to review your licenses and look for opportunities to make a license available to another community member.
How can you help?
As a first step, we’re asking ServiceNow Group Managers to self-audit and ensure all users in their group need to view and manage tickets in the system. If someone has moved to a new role where they don’t need to work on ServiceNow tickets, if you remove them from your group, you will save a license for another member of the Stanford community to use. To learn how to verify your group members in ServiceNow, you can view this quick article."
Help & Ticketing Systems,Best Practices for Fulfilling ServiceNow Incidents and Requests,"Best practices exist to deliver a consistent experience to end users and to increase workgroup efficiency. Although Incidents require more urgent resolution than Requests, they both share common best practices.
Use the Appropriate Ticket Type
When submitting a ticket on behalf of someone, or for yourself as a fulliller, use the appropriate ticket type. This keeps metrics accurate to facilitate continuous improvement and as mentioned above, the expected completion times vary.

Incidents (records prefaced with INC) - Incidents should be used to report IT related issues such as a broken computer, trouble accessing an application, etc. Incidents are to be resolved as quickly as possible since they can be preventing users from completing their work.
Requests (records prefaced with REQ, RITM or TASK) - Requests are currently used by IT groups. They are submitted to request something such as a new computer, password reset, etc. Upon submission, three records are generated, a Request (REQ), Request Item (RITM) and Catalog Task (TASK). Request forms, that sit within a catalog, are comprised of variables/fields to collect necessary information used to fulfill a request. Requests use predefined workflows to facilitate or automate tasks, for example approvals.
Support Request (records prefaced with SR) - Support Requests are used by Non-IT groups, however, it is also available to IT groups for ad hoc tasks. They have the same look and feel as Requests within the catalog and also use variables/fields to collect necessary information from end users for fulfillment. Compared to normal Requests, they do not have multiple records that generate upon submission. On the back-end, fulfilling a Support Request looks similar to an Incident and is resolved in a similar manner.

Ensure Accurate Contact Information is Listed
When logging a new ticket on behalf of someone else, if they are a Stanford affiliate, adding their name in the Reported by or Requested by field will automatically populate their email and phone number listed in the Stanford directory. Stanford affiliates may have multiple user accounts or, there could be multiple users with the same name. You should make sure to validate the correct Stanford account by verifying the SUNet ID displayed next to their name. If the user information is not populating from the directory, that means their account is either marked private or doesn't exist yet in the directory, in which case, they should be entered in as a guest. Ensure the phone number and email address listed is correct. 
Tip: The Reported by/Requested by, by default, will receive ServiceNow email notifications when a comment is added in the additional comments. Use the Watch List if you want the emails to go to additional individuals as well.  
Designate a Coordinator/Queue Manager
Designating a coordinator/queue manager helps ensure tickets are on the radar of staff available to fulfill them. They can assign tickets based on individual availability and facilitate the quick movement of misrouted tickets.  
Add a Work Note When Transferring a Ticket
If you need to transfer a ticket to a different group, add a work note with an explanation for the transfer. This will also help the receiving group determine if they should facilitate some corrective actions to ensure proper routing of their future tickets. 
Assign New Tickets to a Group, Not an Individual
If you are transferring a ticket (after typing a helpful Work Note - see above) assign it to a group, not an individual. That will reduce the risk of assigning the ticket to someone who is unavailable. The only exception should be when a fulfiller explicitly asks you to assign the ticket to them. 
Assign Ticket Ownership
Coordinators or Queue Managers should review incoming tickets and assign them to an individual to avoid multiple group members working on the same ticket. 
Adjust the State or Status
Adjusting the state or status of a ticket is a quick way for others to know what the status is of a ticket. For example, “Work in Progress” indicates that someone is actively working on a ticket whereas “Awaiting User Info” indicates some pending action is needed from the end user. 
Provide Frequent Updates
To track the activity on a ticket, updates are highly recommended. Status updates to the end users helps them understand that their ticket is being actively worked. 

Additional comments - Use this field for end user updates and communications
Work notes - Use this field to post the activities done on this ticket

Resolve the Ticket
It is always best to confirm with the end user that you have fulfilled their Request or resolved their Incident to their satisfaction.
In some cases, fulfillers reach out to the customer for clarifying information on several occasions with no response. UIT has a policy that allows fulfillers to resolve a ticket if the end user fails to respond after three attempts over a two-week period. This is based on the assumption that the end user no longer needs assistance.
Enter meaningful close notes when closing out a ticket so the end user knows what action was taken to fulfill their Incident or Request.
The three different ticket types have different resolution to closure times:

Requests automatically auto close upon fulfillment
Support Requests auto close 30 business days upon resolution*
Incidents auto close 5 business days after resolution*

*During this time, end users have the ability to re-open their ticket by indicating their issue has not been resolved on the resolution email they receive.  
Share Information
During the fulfillment of a ticket, if there is knowledge gained that can be leveraged in the future, create a knowledge article. 
Leverage Reports
Several reports exist in ServiceNow to help manage group’s activities.View this knowledge article for common and useful reports."
Help & Ticketing Systems,Support Request Now Available for IT Fulfillers,"Support Requests are now available for IT fulfillers in addition to non-IT groups to use for request management. This additional functionality will help fulfillers request an action by another fulfiller unrelated to an incident, problem, request or change. 
Highlights of Support Request:

Child tasks can be created off of a Support Request so multiple teams can be involved in the fulfillment process.
Integration with JIRA system to create CR's.
Incidents can be triggered from a Support Request.
Support requests can be triggered off a Call.
Business-focused services can be selected, separating the business function from the technical service offering. This is especially helpful for those teams who provide value-added services unrelated to the underlying technical systems.
Secure Support Requests are completely hidden away from non-secured groups and their members. This is a slightly different model from the current implementation of Incidents where a minimal set of fields are visible to all fulfillers on secure tickets.
Support Requests are closed 30 business days after resolution. This time frame is longer than how Incidents are handled today where the gap between Closed and Resolved is 5 business days.
Once a Support Request is closed, it cannot be re-opened. A new Support Request would have to be opened to attend to any outstanding tasks.
Assignment group signatures can be added to email notifications.

To get started with Support Request, check out the Quick Start Guide for IT fulfillers."
Help & Ticketing Systems,What is the difference between a Service Owner and a Service Manager?,"Many have wondered what the difference is between a Service Owner and a Service Manager.  While here at Stanford, we often have the same person play both roles, according to ITIL, these two roles are quite distinct.
Service Owner: Service owners focus on the big picture - service planning, development and improvement. They are NOT engaged in the day-to-day management of the service. Service owners are accountable for the quality, delivery, and technology of a particular service, with primary responsibility for the service and technology roadmap and the strategic direction.  Services owners are typically a Director or Manager and play a strategic role.
Service Manager: Service managers focus on the day-to-day management of the service. They are responsible for ensuring the implementation and management of the service roadmap and lifecycle, as established by the Service Owner.  Services Managers are typically a Technical Manager and play a more tactical role.
For a full list of responsibilities, check out Confluence."
Help & Ticketing Systems,How to Get a ServiceNow Direct Link (PCAT) for a Service,"Direct links or ""PCATS"" can be extracted from ServiceNow to ensure that incidents and requests are ""directly"" assigned to the proper fulfillment group. They can be published on webpages, embedded in applications or distributed to clients in any fashion that is available to them to get quick support.

Help & Ticketing Systems,ServiceNow Inbound Web Services API,"ServiceNow supports a variety of inbound Web Services that enable developers to easily integrate other applications with ServiceNow. These web services use REST, SOAP, EXCEL and services with more specific functionality like PDF and RSS.
RESTful web services offer several advantages, including:
Support for different HTTP methods to perform different actionsDetailed response codes and header informationPagination support for large data setsStreaming data on GET requestsUse of display values to present data in a user-understandable form
In ServiceNow, there is concept of display values and actual values. The actual value represents the raw value in the database, whereas the display value represents the value that is usually shown in the UI. For some fields, there are significant differences in how these values display in the UI vs. in the database.  Examples:
Reference fields: The database value is sys_id, but the display value is a display field of a referenced record.Data fields: The database value is in UTC format, while the display value is based on the user's time zone.Choice fields: The database value may be a number, but the display value will be more descriptive.


To maintain the security and the integrity of the data in ServiceNow, as well as system performance, we will be using the “Scripted REST API” to build web service APIs. This feature will allow our ServiceNow developers to perform complex operations on multiple records by having control of the API code.
Process to create a new Scripted REST API
Following are the steps to request, develop, test and migrate to production a new Scripted REST API.
Submit a ServiceNow Request using the Create a ServiceNow Scripted REST API form. API Requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and it is important for you to provide as much information as possible so that we can better support your request. We will review your request for completeness, potential impact on system performance, the extent to which your solution will survive ServiceNow upgrades, and possible exposure to High Risk Data. Please allow three to five business days for the review of your request.Include the following in your request:
Business needDescription and usage of the API (describe whether the API will be used by an application or user/command line). Please state if you currently use a similar Remedy API.HTTP Method (POST, GET, PATCH, PUT)ServiceNow Table (incident, sc_task, sc_request)Request format to use (application/json, application/xml)List of the request/query parameters Note: A list of the available fields/parameters can be found at the ServiceNow Data Dictionary. You can also find a list of the possible values for the Choice FieldsResponse format to use (application/json, application/xml)List of response parametersNote: A list of the available fields/parameters can be found at the ServiceNow Data Dictionary. You can also find a list of the possible values for the Choice FieldsData Security 
Risk level of the data to be accessed (ServiceNow secure tickets/secure groups)Security measures that will be used for end-user accessFor a system to system integration, indicate the web service security standard(s) that can be supported by your system (i.e. Basic Auth, OAuth, etc)
Usage Details
Audience type (external, internal, both)Approximate number of usersApproximate Requests/DayPeak usage timingApproximate Peak Timing requests/minute

If your request is approved for implementation, the development team will develop a Scripted REST API in the ServiceNow DEV instance. You will be responsible for developing the API code for the application that will receive the ServiceNow API response. Code snippets for various programming languages are included in the examples below:Example ServiceNow Scripted REST API: /getincidentsExample ServiceNow Scripted REST API: /getincidentdetails You will be provided with:
A Web Services account (user/password)Note: This account requires a ServiceNow fulfiller/ITIL license in PRD. Your team will be responsible to protect and maintain the security of the Web Services account password. To request a password change, please submit a ""Modify a Scripted REST API"" form (see below).A REST API URI (name_space, api_id, resource_path)REST endpoint type ACLs to define access controlsAPI request parameters specification 
After you have successfully validated the API functionality in the DEV instance, the development team will migrate the code to the TEST instance where you will be responsible to complete the User Acceptance Testing.We will coordinate the API migration to the PRD instance.
Note: You will be responsible to test the API functionality during or after ServiceNow patch and release updates. We will send notifications when the schedules for such updates are known.
Process to modify/delete a Scripted REST API
Following are the steps to request, develop, test and migrate to production changes to an existing Scripted REST API. 
Submit a ServiceNow Request using the Modify or Delete a ServiceNow Scripted REST API form. API Requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and it is important for you to provide as much information as possible so that we can better support your request. We will review your request for completeness, potential impact on system performance, the extent to which your solution will survive ServiceNow upgrades, and possible exposure to High Risk Data. Please allow three to five business days for the review of your request. Include the following in your request: 
Name of the API to be modifiedReason(s) for modificationModification details

Help & Ticketing Systems,How Do I Convert an Incident to a Support Request?,"If an end user logs a ticket as an Incident but it should be a Support Request, a fulfiller can easily convert it. This allows groups using Support Requests to resolve their tickets using their applicable Business Functions, Classification Codes, etc.
1. Assign the Incident to yourself
To enable the ability (action) to convert an Incident to a Support Request, the Assignment group and the Assigned to fields on the incident form should be filled out with your information and saved. 

2. Convert the Incident to a Support Request
Navigate to the hamburger button in the left corner near the Incident number and click on it. This will expand a menu with several different actions you can take. 
Select 'Create Support Request'.

3. Fulfill the Support Request
Once the Incident has been converted, fill out the required fields and other information needed to fulfill the Support Request as you normally would.
What Transfers Over from the Incident to the Support Request?
The fields that copy over from the Incident to the Support Request are:
Short DescriptionDescription (this is the first comment or work note entered on the Incident) Assignment groupAssigned toAttachmentsUser information Security flag
What Happens When the Conversion is Made?
1. Incident Permanently Closes
When the Support Request is created, the Incident permanently closes. 
You can see the Incident number on the 'Closure Information' tab on the Support Request.

The Incident will also have a work log entry noting that the Incident was converted to a Support Request and the 'Closure Information' tab will be updated with a Classification code of 'Transferred to Support Request' and Close notes that displays the Support Request number.

2. Submitter is Notified of the Ticket Number Change
A notification is sent to the Submitter notifying them that their ticket number has changed."

Help & Ticketing Systems,Why Do My ServiceNow Records Look Different?,"If you log in to ServiceNow and notice that your view looks different than it normally does (i.e., key fields are missing from a form), there are a few things that can be the cause. The most common reason is the 'Default View' is not set. Another reason is the 'Tabbed forms' tab has been switched on or off.
Default View
The 'Default View' is the view that fulfillers normally see and are accustomed to when logging in.
How do I know what view I'm in?
If you are in a view other than the default, next to the record number, there will be some text. The example below shows that this record is being viewed in the Self Service view.  

How do I get my view back to the Default View?
Within a ticket
In order to get back to your normal view, do the following:

Within the ticket, navigate to the hamburger button in the top left corner near the ticket number and click on it.
Click 'View' in the pick list.
Select 'Default view'.



From a list

If you are on a list, for example, you are viewing all tickets assigned to you, navigate to the hamburger button in the top left corner.
Select Change View.
Another window will pop up from which you want to select 'Default view'.



Tabbed Forms Turned Off
The 'Tabbed form' setting presents related data within a ticket in a tabbed form. There is an option to turn this off so that the information displays in one long continuous list. 
If that option gets turned off and you want to turn it back on, here is how:

Help & Ticketing Systems,"Why does UIT IT Operations Center (ITOC) take ownership of Major Incident, P1 and P2, Tickets?","The Major Incident process exists to facilitate the restoration of services due to a service outage or degradation. There are tasks that happen behind the scenes to make sure the appropriate people are notified of issues as they arise and that the community is properly alerted and updated.
What is a Major Incident?
A “Major Incident” is defined as a widespread, serious, major interruption or outage of a critical service that must be resolved with great urgency. They are classified as P1 and P2 Incident tickets. The aim of the Major Incident Process is to quickly restore service with any means necessary, including workarounds.
How does it get routed?
When an Incident is declared as a P1 or P2, it routes to the UIT IT Operations Center (ITOC). They take responsibility and ownership of the Incident until it is resolved.
Why does it route to ITOC?
ITOC is staffed 24x7. They have operating procedures to validate the legitimacy and magnitude of an Incident. They maintain contact information for Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) so they know who to call and how to pull together the appropriate people to work an issue. After pulling together the appropriate people, they have a process to find out what is going on and when service might be restored so they can relay that information back to the community.
What does ITOC do with a Major Incident? 
Once a Major Incident is declared, ITOC validates the legitimacy of the Incident. They reach out to the appropriate SMEs and generate an Incident Task (INCT), from a parent Incident. That Incident Task is then used to gather updates from the SMEs on their investigation and remediation efforts. That information is then communicated to the Stanford community via communication channels such as Slack, bridges and the Services & Support portal.
The entire process can be viewed here."

Security Tools,File Storage Security FAQs,"What is the goal of the File Storage Security Program?
The file storage security program was established to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data across all major university file storage systems by proactively identifying and remediating unduly exposed files, implementing automated protection mechanisms, and archiving unneeded data.
What file storage systems are being scanned?
Currently Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, AFS, and select departmental Windows file servers are being scanned by the automated tool.
What data does the automated tool identify as High Risk?
The automated tool searches for patterns indicative of sensitive data such as Social Security Numbers, credit card numbers, medical record numbers, and bank account numbers.
How do I prevent my files from being scanned in the future?
All broadly shared files are scanned (i.e., those shared with 100 or more individuals). To prevent your file from being scanned, reduce the access permissions of your files to the minimum number of people that need to collaborate on the file.
Are people reading through my private files?
The automated tool is only scanning the contents of broadly shared files (i.e., those shared with 100 or more individuals). Manual inspection is only performed when necessary, such as part of an investigation."
Security Tools,Preparing a personally owned computer to meet School of Medicine (SoM) Data Security Compliance requirements,"The School of Medicine (SoM) requires that any computer used for Stanford work, even to check email, must be encrypted. It is recommended that before encrypting a computer that the data are backed up and all updates to the operating system have been completed.
Policy
IT support staff will not provide direct hands-on hardware and software support for personally owned computer equipment regardless of the physical location of the equipment. IRT staff can consult or guide the client as they navigate their own computer. IT support staff are not responsible for adding or removing software required by Stanford to meet University or SoM data security requirements on personally owned devices. However, staff should offer instructions/guidance, direct users to appropriate websites, answer questions, suggest tools, etc.
IRT support technicians will be happy to offer instructions/guidance to assist you at any step of the following process but you have to “do the driving” and navigate your own system with the technician's guidance. We cannot guarantee that the upgrade process will go as planned; there can be unexpected failures with hardware or software. Some 3rd-party software may need to be reinstalled, updated, or a newer version may need to be purchased to work with the new operating system.
Backing up your data

Back up your personally owned computer data to an external hard drive. These are relatively inexpensive even for a large capacity. For example, a Western Digital 1TB Portable External Hard Drive - USB 3.0 sells for $55 from Amazon.
For Mac computers, use the built in Time Machine backup capability.
For Windows computers, use the built in backup utility for Windows 7 and 8; also for Windows 10.
To backup and restore using Windows 10.
The SoM provides CrashPlan as a backup utility for Windows and Mac.

Updating and upgrading your operating system (OS)

Update your current operating system (OS) with the latest patches and updates.
More information on upgrading and updating Mac computers can be found through the App Store. Apply patches to the current OS before upgrading to the higher OS.
Checking for updates on Windows computers can be done from the Start menu on the computer. Check with IRT if you have questions.
For Windows computers, you may need to purchase/obtain the latest operating system. If you already have Windows 10 Professional, then no purchase is needed.

Cloud Network,"Using NetDB to point a Stanford Name to a Cloud IP number (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure)","There are three ways to point your [name].stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford (“cloud”) service provider:
1: Via an “A record,” or ""AAAA Record"" (called the “name” in NetDB), where you point your stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford IP number. This will be explained in this article.2: Via a CNAME, where you have your stanford.edu name as an alias, or CNAME, to a non-Stanford name, which is explained in Using NetDB to point a Stanford CNAME to a Cloud DNS Name.3: Via a delegated domain, which will is explained in Using NetDB to delegate Stanford domains.
For AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, you may be asked to make an A or AAAA record that points a stanford.edu name to one of their IP numbers specifically. If you are working with a different hosting provider that wants to use an A/AAAA record, the following instructions still apply.
This article will explain how to connect your stanford.edu hostname to an AWS, GCP or Azure IP number, and what to do if you can't assign the IP number that you've been asked to assign.
NetDB cannot contain the entirety of the world's IP numbers, so if you need a non-Stanford IP range, it will have to be defined. It would add unnecessary load to the NetDB database to automatically add all IP ranges from AWS, GCP and Azure, so we will only add those ranges as requested. If you get an error that the IP range you want to use is not in NetDB, please put in a ticket with the IP range that you need to use and, most importantly, the NetDB group(s) that need rights to that IP range.
Within NetDB, the IP ranges are defined in these network entries:

Amazon-AWS-Net
google-cloud
azure-cloud

You can do a ""quick search"" and choose the ""network"" option to see them. There are a few others smaller cloud vendors (Vercel, Linode, etc.) with IP ranges in NetDB.
Within those network entries are many IP ranges. For each IP range, a specific list of NetDB groups are given rights to use those IP numbers. Here is one example from the azure-cloud network entry:
addr space: 13.96.0.0/13 lo: 0 hi: 0group: Amazon-Web-Services, cloud-platform
That IP range is huge, and contains all the IP numbers from 13.96.0.0 through 13.103.255.255. It may be difficult to determine if the IP address you've been assigned is in NetDB if the second octet doesn't match one that's defined in the network entry.
Use this tool to determine what the super-net IP range is for your assigned IP number: https://whois.arin.net/ui/
The search box is a tiny box in the upper right.
For example, if you were told to use 40.80.90.100, you would get the following result:



Network


Net Range
40.74.0.0 - 40.125.127.255


CIDR
40.112.0.0/13 40.120.0.0/14 40.124.0.0/16 40.125.0.0/17 40.74.0.0/15 40.76.0.0/14 40.80.0.0/12 40.96.0.0/12 



The ""net range"" at the top let's you look for the CIDR blocks listed below. It tells you that the Net Range that contains 40.80.90.100 starts with 40.74, so look below and see ""40.74.0.0/15"". From within NetDB, enter ""40.74.0.0/15"" into the quick search box and select ""Networks"" as the record type, and you'll see the single result of ""azure-cloud"" which tells you that the IP range is, in fact, defined.
Clicking on the ""azure-cloud"" result in NetDB lets you see all the IP ranges that are defined in NetDB. You'll notice most of those 40.* IP ranges are not defined, as we have not been asked to define them. If you need one defined, please put in a ticket listing the IP range in CIDR format and the NetDB group(s) that need to be able to assign IP numbers in that range. If you're not sure about the CIDR range, UIT Networking will look that up and use it.
You'll also see that the only NetDB groups with permission to assign IP numbers in 40.74.0.0/15 are: Amazon-Web-Services, cloud-platform, Enterprise Technology. If your NetDB account doesn't have one of those groups, please put in a ticket letting us know which group that you're a member of should be added to that IP range.
To summarize:

You can point your stanford.edu host name to an AWS, GCP or Azure IP number (or one of many other non-Stanford IP numbers)
There's a good chance the IP range you want to use may not be defined.
There's a chance that the IP range is defined, but none of the NetDB groups to which you belong can use that range

If you need an IP range defined or modified, please enter a NetDB ticket: https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9ec7c49613bce2008a9175c36144b03e"
Cloud Network,Using NetDB to point a Stanford CNAME to a Cloud DNS Name,"Please note: This is an article about DNS, not URLs. The following is a URL:
https://museum.stanford.edu/programs/
This article will only discuss the DNS part, which is in yellow, and how an organization could have that particular Stanford.EDU node name point to a non-Stanford node name. All the parts that in red are the URL, and are beyond the scope of this document.
Local Network Administrators are encouraged to create and maintain their own “cloud” DNS records in NetDB if there is no conflict with other organizations. If you do not have NetDB access, please pass this article to your local support so that they may create the record that you need. You can find your Local Network Administrator here: https://web.stanford.edu/group/networking/dist/sunet.reports/LNA.html
There are three ways to point your [name].stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford (“cloud”) service provider:
1: Via a CNAME, where you have your stanford.edu name as an alias, or CNAME, to a non-Stanford name, which is explained here.
2: Via an “A record,” (called the “name” in NetDB), where you point your stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford IP number. See Using NetDB to point a Stanford Name to a Cloud IP number (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure) for details.
3: Via a delegated domain, which is explained in Using NetDB to delegate Stanford domains.
If you are using Squarespace, they use CNAME records but have some special requirements. Please see Squarespace DNS Redirect Instructions for instructions.
A CNAME, or Canonical Name, (referred to in NetDB as an “alias”) is a name that points to another name. DNS needs an IP number, so eventually there needs to be an “A record,” which is a name pointing to an IP number, but that “A record” doesn’t need to be served by Stanford’s DNS. In the above example, museum.stanford.edu is an alias (CNAME) for live-cantor-arts.pantheonsite.io, and the A Record is maintained by Pantheon, not Stanford.
Using a CNAME has a few advantages:
• If your service provider changes IP numbers, you don’t need to make any changes.
• You may be able to have a unique NetDB entry that is not shared with other organizations, even if all of those entries end up pointing to the same IP number.
The primary disadvantage of using a CNAME is that a CNAME can never be shared with an MX or TXT record. If you already have an MX record (used for email) or a TXT record (often used for site verification), you may not use a CNAME. This is an absolute rule of DNS, and there’s no way around it. You may still use an “A record” to point your stanford.edu name to another organization’s IP number if you have an MX or TXT record.
If you are working with a service provider (such as Pantheon, Weebly, Fastly, Acquia, Wix, etc.), they may request that you make a [your-name].Stanford.EDU CNAME pointing to their “A record” (or node name). If you use an automated wizard, it will almost never check to see if there is an existing MX or TXT record, so it may give you an impossible and prohibited request. You will need to contact your service provider to resolve that conflict, or find a different provider.
To check yourself, if you are not familiar with the “host” or “dig” commands, you may use this tool from Google: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/
Enter your desired fully qualified domain name (i.e.: your-site-name.stanford.edu) and then click on the MX button, and again on the TXT button. If you see “Record not found!” for both buttons, you’re OK, and may proceed with creating the CNAME/alias record. Do not trust that your web hosting provider will do these simple checks for you.
 
Once you have confirmed that you do not have a conflict with MX or TXT records, you might be able to make that entry yourself in NetDB. To do so, you need to check the following.
•Does the non-Stanford domain exist in NetDB? If not, you may request that it be added, and make sure you let us know the NetDB Group(s) that need to be able to make names within that domain.
•Do you share a NetDB group with the “create names in” list for that domain in NetDB? If not, you need to request that your group(s) be added to the “create names in” list for that domain. “All Groups” access does not work for “Create Names In” for domains.
 
In NetDB, from the “Full Search” pull-down, choose “Domain.” Search for the subdomain in which you’ve been asked to make a record. For example, if you’ve been asked to point your-site-name.stanford.edu to your-site.name.stanford.edu.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com, do a NetDB Full Search…Domain for stanford.edu.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com and then look to see if one of the groups that you’re a member of is listed under “Create names in (Groups).”
It’s possible that, like Squarespace, your provider will ask that you point your CNAME to a global name shared by many aliases. In that case, you can put in a ticket to ask that UIT Networking add your CNAME to the list.
If you need to have a domain created or modified so you can use it, or need to share an existing record, you can use this shortcut: https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9ec7c49613bce2008a9175c36144b03e
 
Once you have the rights to create this record in NetDB, please do the following:
For “Name” put the Fully Qualified Domain Name that your provider has given. This will be in your provider's domain, this is not the stanford.edu name. In the above example, it's live-cantor-arts.pantheonsite.io.
Add one alias, and put your *.stanford.edu name there. This would be museum.stanford.edu in our example.
You will probably want to check the “virtual” checkbox for your own searches and reports.
For location, “Cyberspace,” “Amazon Web Services,” “Google Cloud Platform,” and “Azure Cloud Computing” are all pre-defined. Please use one of those instead of a random building.
For Make/Model, “Amazon AWS,” “Google GCP,” ”Microsoft Azure,” and “virtual webserver” are already defined and appropriate.
For Operating System, ""virtual"" is appropriate.
You don’t need to enter an IP number. Any IP number you enter won’t work anyway, as NetDB will see that the *.stanford.edu name points to a non-Stanford name, so NetDB won’t send any IP numbers to DNS."
Cloud Network,Q&As About Cloud Solutions,"Review these questions and answers to learn about University IT's cloud strategy and transition of the StanfordWho directory to the cloud.
About UIT’s Cloud Strategy
Why are cloud solutions essential to the university?
Cloud-sourced software products offer the best solutions and range of options available in the marketplace — with rapidly improving capabilities, use of advanced technologies, and robust hosting services.
It’s desirable for UIT to migrate applications and IT infrastructure to the cloud for numerous reasons, which are detailed on this UIT Cloud Transformation webpage and summarized here:
Campus space is at a premiumService improvements are continuousCloud computing resources can easily scale up and down, as necessaryTime to provision computing resources is expected to be quickEarthquake danger is real, and cloud services provide geo-diversity
What is UIT’s overall strategy with cloud providers?
UIT is continuously looking for smart ways to leverage innovative cloud solutions that can benefit the university.
In calendar year 2019, we will migrate UIT systems from our Livermore data center to the cloud, selecting scalable, cost-efficient, innovative, and resilient solutions that further enable the Stanford community. Once these migrations are complete, we will focus on systems in our on-campus data center, using the experience and expertise gained from the Livermore migrations.
While we acknowledge some critical systems will need to remain on campus, our priority is to achieve geodiversity using the cloud.
How does UIT currently leverage cloud providers?
UIT currently leverages cloud providers for robust solutions, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Google, ServiceNow, Zoom, Slack, and many others. These include infrastructure, platform, and software-as-a-service solutions.
What processes are in place to safeguard Stanford data that is shared with cloud providers?
Cloud providers are required to be at least as rigorous as Stanford is with regard to data privacy, and those expectations are always included in our contractual agreements with such providers.
Before any agreement is made, we carefully vet potential cloud vendors through a number of processes, including security and data privacy reviews that vary in rigor depending on the risk classification of the data we plan to share.
Additionally, UIT partners closely with the university’s Privacy and Procurement Offices to consummate contracts related to sharing Stanford data with cloud providers.
More information about security policies related to cloud solutions can be found on the security page of the UIT Cloud Transformation website.
About the StanfordWho Transition
What changed?
StanfordWho, formally known as Stanford People and Organization Search, is the web application that allows you to search the Stanford directory of faculty, staff, students, and sponsored affiliates at Stanford University and the Stanford hospitals to view contact and organization information.
Almost 20 years old, StanfordWho was built by Stanford’s then central IT business unit. It was introduced to the Stanford community as a robust web-based people and organization search application.
In July 2018, UIT began partnering with a cloud provider called Rimeto to create a more scalable, cost-efficient, secure, and resilient underlying infrastructure for the university's directory solution. 
The change was announced in this UIT news article. With the change, the login-protected Stanford and Affiliates view was delivered using this new infrastructure, while the Public view continued to use the original interface.
In June 2019, UIT also moved the Public view to the new infrastructure to create a richer and more consistent user experience. The change was announced in this UIT news article. 
In December 2021, UIT moved StanfordWho to a new platform due to a required transition to a new vendor called Axero Solutions. The change was announced in this UIT news article, and details about the interface changes are described on StanfordWho service pages. 
Why is UIT making this change?
The StanfordWho directory transition to the cloud is part of UIT’s overall strategy to migrate most of its service portfolio to cloud-based products or cloud deployments. Learn more about UIT’s cloud strategy in the answer above.
What are the benefits of the new cloud solution?
UIT selected this solution to provide a more modern display and new features and functionality to what was a 20-year-old homegrown directory system.
Enhancements include:
Visibility into your role and department in the organization. You will see associated departments and staff roles for anyone you look up in the directory. The ability to search the Stanford directory by keyword topics. This allows you to search for Stanford colleagues by area of work or specialty.Visible Stanford Profiles (Community Academic Profiles, or CAP) photos. For those who do not have a visible Stanford Profile photo, you will see a Stanford stock image.Simpler searches across directories. You can begin a search for a colleague in the updated Public view and continue it in the Stanford and Affiliates view without re-entering the name.Visual consistency. The design of the Public view looks like the restricted Stanford and Affiliates view, providing more visual consistency across StanfordWho.
Additional enhancements will be rolled out over time, including changes that the cloud provider may introduce.
What options do I have with my personal data?
The transition of StanfordWho to the cloud has not changed any of your options with your personal data. You continue to have the same options as you have in the past, including whether to list your personal data in the public or Stanford-only view.
You can edit your profile on your own profile page. Select “Edit your directory information” to go to StanfordYou where you can manage your privacy and visibility settings for your directory information. To verify or change your current visibility settings, from your profile page, select “Edit your directory information,” then select “Maintain your directory and AlertSU emergency contact information.” From the right sidebar, select your privacy and visibility preferences.
Note: StanfordYou is the application where you enter and change your own directory information. StanfordWho is the application that displays directory information to the public and/or Stanford community, depending on each individual’s settings.
You now also have the option to include a photo on your profile page in StanfordWho. If you’d like your photo to appear in the directory, you can add your photo to Stanford Profiles (Community Academic Profiles, or CAP), and it will be pulled into your StanfordWho profile.
Learn more about the changes to the profile interface on the  Stanford and Affiliates view webpage or the Public view webpage. For help with how to maintain your directory information on StanfordYou, visit the StanfordYou Help page."
Cloud Network,Cloud Network Definitions,"Private Internet Addresses
Private Internet network addressing at Stanford is defined by standards maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and documented in RFC1918.
RFC1918 specifies the ability for Stanford University - and any other organization - to allocate IP addresses that permit full network connectivity between all hosts within the organization’s network using these addresses as well as any public Internet address allocated for use within the organization only. At Stanford, this means that hosts with RFC1918 addresses can connect to any public Stanford IP address, but not (directly) with any public IPs outside Stanford’s IP space.
Private address allocations at Stanford University must be locally unique within Stanford University networks but are not globally unique.
RFC1918 defines the following network address blocks as private (non-internet routable) addresses:
10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255)
172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255)
192.168.0.0/24 (192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255)
Stanford University networks do not currently have a support plan for Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses defined by RFC4193 which can be considered IPv6 analogous to IPv4 private Internet network addressing. 
Public Internet Addresses
Stanford University public Internet network addresses are blocks of addresses allocated by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) that are globally unique. These addresses can provide full network connectivity between any hosts using public addresses globally. These addresses can also provide full network connectivity between hosts at Stanford University using public addresses and any hosts using private addresses at Stanford University only.
The Stanford University public Internet address blocks are:
IPv4:
68.65.160.0/20 (68.65.160.0 – 68.65.175.255)
128.12.0.0/16 (128.12.0.0 – 128.12.255.255)
171.64.0.0/14 (171.64.0.0 – 171.67.255.255)
204.63.224.0/21 (204.63.224.0 - 204.63.231.255)


IPv6:
2607:f6d0::/32 (2607:f6d0:0:0:0:0:0:0 - 2607:f6d0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff)
FQDN Firewall Policies
Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) may be used for either inbound or outbound firewall policies but should only be used when static Internet addresses cannot be used. Stanford University firewalls have a limit in the number of FQDN address objects that can be configured. There will be a time lag of up to an hour between when a service has changed Internet addresses and the firewalls update their FQDN object Internet address mappings."

Cloud Network,Using NetDB to delegate Stanford domains,"There are 3 ways to point your [name].stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford (“cloud”) service provider:
1: Via a delegated domain (using Amazon's Route 53 service, or Google Domains, or similar services), which is explained here.
2: Via an “A record,” (called the “name” in NetDB), where you point your stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford IP number. See Using NetDB to point a Stanford Name to a Cloud IP number (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure) for details.
3: Via a CNAME, where you have your stanford.edu name as an alias, or CNAME, to a non-Stanford name, which is explained in Using NetDB to point a Stanford CNAME to a Cloud DNS Name.

Stanford’s DNS Zone is “Stanford.EDU,” which means that Stanford’s DNS servers are in charge of almost every host and subdomain within Stanford.EDU. Domain delegation fills in the “almost” qualifier of the previous sentence. By delegating a domain, you are announcing to the world that the name servers for that particular stanford.edu subdomain are not the normal Stanford name servers. You may delegate that subdomain to a cloud provider, such as AWS Route 53, or to other Stanford name servers that your organization maintains.
If you choose to delegate your subdomain, NetDB will no longer be the source for DNS for your domain. You will have to use whatever tools your provider has. UIT Networking can offer no support for your delegated domain.
Advantages of a delegated domain:
• Survivability should there be problems with Stanford’s network (alertsu.stanford.edu and police.stanford.edu are delegated for this purpose).
• A shorter or longer DNS refresh rate than Stanford’s 30 minute DNS refresh rate.
• Complete control over your DNS.
Disadvantages of a delegated domain:
• Complete responsibility for your DNS.
• NetDB will not feed your DNS, but can be used for record keeping.
If you already have any TXT, MX or CNAME records for the name that you want to use as your subdomain, those need to be deleted first before the domain can be delegated. You can recreate them with your DNS provider afterwards.
To delegate a domain, please send a NetDB ticket with the following link:
https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9ec7c49613bce2008a9175c36144b03e
Please include (in text form only, no screen captures please):
• The domain name.
• The name servers.
• Your administrative contact, preferably with a NetDB Admin Team.
You may still want to point regular Stanford.EDU names as aliases to names within your delegated subdomain. That is handled with NetDB, just like any “cloud” domain, by specifying the correct group(s) that need to “Create Names In” that domain. If that’s needed, please include that in your request."

Something to consider before getting started 
The audio quality of a softphone connection — both what you hear and what the other person hears — is impacted by the microphone and speakers you are using. While most modern computers come with built-in microphones and speakers, you might want to invest in a high-quality headset to improve the audio quality.

Chat,Using Jabber Softphone on a Mac,"Using the softphone feature, you can easily place, receive, and manage telephone calls using your computer or mobile device and an internet connection. University IT provides support for a softphone through the Jabber application, allowing you to simulate your Stanford telephone using your Mac.
The Jabber softphone feature is also available for Windows computers, and iOS and Android mobile devices.

Something to consider before getting started 
The audio quality of a softphone connection — both what you hear and what the other person hears — is impacted by the microphone and speakers you are using. While most modern computers come with built-in microphones and speakers, you might want to invest in a high-quality headset to improve the audio quality. A headset can also reduce surrounding noise and increase privacy. Headset recommendations.

Place a call
You can place a softphone call in three ways:
USING YOUR CONTACTS LIST
Click the person icon in the Jabber hub.Hover over the appropriate contact’s name and click the green phone icon.  The call is placed to the person’s Stanford telephone number.
For details on adding contacts to your Contacts list, see Managing Contacts.
SEARCHING THE STANFORD JABBER DIRECTORY
Type the person’s name in the Jabber hub Search or call field.It is best to type the name as completely as possible since Jabber will only display the first 15 matches. Hover over the appropriate contact’s name in the search results and click the green phone icon. The call is placed to the person’s Stanford telephone number.
TYPING THE TELEPHONE NUMBER 
Type the person’s phone number in the Jabber hub Search or call field.Important: When entering a non-Stanford number, you must enter a 9 first, then the rest of the number as you would from a telephone (e.g., 916509871234). With Stanford telephone numbers, you can dial the last five digits or the full seven or ten digit number. Click the green phone icon next to the Search or call field.The call is placed to the entered telephone number.
Receive a call
You must be logged in to the Jabber application to receive a call using your softphone. Settings affect a telephone number regardless if they are set on your desk phone or your softphone. So, for example, if your forward your desk phone to voicemail, your softphone is also forwarded to voicemail and you will not receive calls. Changing the setting on one also changes the setting on the other.
When you receive an incoming call, you’ll see a call window open on your computer screen.
Click Accept to accept the call.Click Decline to forward the call to voicemail.
Forward and unforward calls
Forwarding sends calls coming to your Stanford phone number to your Stanford voicemail or any other phone number you choose. Unforwarding your calls make them ring on both your desk phone and softphone (when active). Forwarding or unforwarding your calls on your desk phone or softphone affects both phones.
FORWARDING YOUR CALLS
Click the monitor icon in the Jabber hub (bottom right).In the Forward Call to dropdown menu, either:• Select among the listed numbers (numbers to which you’ve recently forwarded your calls) or• Select New Number to enter another phone number.    1. Enter a phone number, including 9, 1, area code and seven-digit phone number (e.g., 914159876543) and press enter on your keyboard.    2. Select the new number in the Forward Calls to: drop down menu.
UNFORWARDING YOUR CALLS
Click the monitor icon in the Jabber hub (bottom right).In the Forward Call to dropdown menu, select Off to top forwarding your calls.

Transferring allows you to transfer a call from your softphone to any other phone on the Stanford system.
Click the more icon (three dots) in the active call window.Select Transfer.This places the active call on hold.Type the name of the person or the phone number to which you want to transfer the call in the search box.Select the person or number when it appears in the search list.You are connected to that number.Press Transfer to complete the transfer.Click the red circle with an ""x"" icon."

Financial Systems,Converged Communication Charges for SoM,"Introduction
University IT bills a monthly lump-sum amount to the School of Medicine (SoM) for converged communications. Then the Dean’s office allocates the charges down to the individual units or departments based on a FTE model as stated below. SoM departments with questions about their converged communications charges should contact Lora Pertle (lpertle@stanford.edu) at SoM Finance.
SoM Finance Explanation
On 9/1/2012, the SoM implemented a telecommunications rate for distributing the desktop phone service costs back to individual units/departments. This was in response to the University’s announcement that they would no longer bill desktop phone services directly to individual depts/units through monthly detailed statements. Instead, the desktop phone service is now charged in a single lump sum to a SoM Dean’s Office fund and the SoM distributes the desktop phone service costs back to individual units/departments through the charging of the telecommunication rate.
The Interdept Conv Comm/Technology fee has been set at 3.0% for FY16 and applies against all salary paid by fund sources (tasks) organizationally coded to the School (except federal sponsored funding and service center PTAs). This rate pays UIT for desktop phone services previously directly paid by your units, and helps contribute towards funding the costs of wired and wireless networking, web site infrastructure, oversight and management as well as a portion of central desktop support.
*Application to Sponsored Projects
The telecommunication charge applies to non-federal/non-government sponsored projects administered through the School of Medicine only. RMG will calculate the 3% rate on all salaries (i.e. faculty, staff, postdocs, and students, and TBN positions) listed on the proposal budget and then enter the amount as a line item in the Other Expenses category as a Telecommunications Charge."

FAQs
What happens to charges for UIT services that fail to process due to an expired PTA?Beginning with April 2021 billing, charges for UIT services that fail to process due to expired PTAs will post to the default clearing account associated with that organization. UIT will use the Accounts Payable (AP) Default PTA for the default clearing account. This new process mirrors the one already being used for payroll and accounts payable invoice transactions that do not have a valid PTA. Here's what you can expect:
Task managers of an expiring PTA and the associated default clearing account will begin receiving alerts 45 days before the PTA is due to expire.If the billing account isn’t updated to a valid PTA, charges for the UIT service will post to the default clearing account after the existing PTA expires.Information on charges posted to the default account can be viewed in the UIT Billing Dashboard. Someone on the finance team will need to clear any charges in the default clearing account and update future billing to a valid PTA.
Why did UIT change the process for expired PTAs?As you know, PTAs can expire over time, causing services to go unbilled. Today, if your PTA expires, a UIT staff member contacts someone in your organization to obtain a valid PTA and update the information in the system. However, this manual tracking effort can result in a backlog of billing exceptions and even the possibility of disconnection of services.How do I update a PTA or cost center for a UIT service?If you have access to OrderIT for your departmental organization, refer to How to Update a Billing Account for instructions."

Financial Systems,How to Request Authority for Ordering and Reporting,"Authority to UIT ordering and reporting systems, such as OrderIT, ServiceNow, UIT Billing Dashboard, or OBIEE, is managed through a web application called Authority Manager that is the central location to grant system privileges to staff in the Stanford community. In order to use the application, an active SUNet ID is required. Individual departments are able to manage authority for themselves by providing grantable privileges to whomever they decide. For more information on Authority Manager, please visit What is Authority Manager. Additionally, the University will have their authority cascading. Instead of having to provide authority to each individual org, granting authority to an org will now grant authority to all the lower orgs that roll up to it.
*For SHC and SCH Hospital Cost Center access, please submit a help ticket here.
As services are transitioned to ServiceNow, anyone with a SUNet ID will be able to submit a request for new services, but depending on their level of authority, their request will either be routed for approval or be auto-approved.  Separate authority is needed for viewing requests, approving requests and viewing billing reports or dashboards.
The roles are broken down as follows:
Requester: Anyone with a SUNet IDRequest Viewer: Has the same authority as ‘Requester’ but can also view and submit Change or Cancel requests to any org or cost center they have authority overRequest Approver: Has the same authority as ‘Request Viewer’ but can also approve requests, and their own requests will be auto-approved for any org or cost center they have authority over. Request Reporting: Can view and run UIT billing reports
Below is a chart that breaks down each role and the privileges included.  Please note that if any of the roles also have the grantable privilege, they can grant or revoke authority for their department for that role.

Each department should have at least two people with Request Viewer, Request Approver and Request Reporting roles with grantable rights to help manage authority for their group.  As we onboard services to ServiceNow, there will be a period where folks will need to use both OrderIT and ServiceNow to order UIT services.

Desktop & Device Support,Print Device Disposal Guidelines,"Why used print devices are a security risk
Multifunctional Devices (MFDs), copiers, scanners, printers, fax machines and other devices may contain hard drives or other media that store data such as images of pages that have been copied, printed or faxed. The data stored on these devices may contain legally sensitive information, including but not limited to personal identifying information or protected health information. The stored data on these devices, in unencrypted form, is highly susceptible to being hacked or retrieved by unauthorized methods. The devices require proper handling through Stanford Surplus, which will manage disposal in adherence to University guidelines, including wiping the hard drives clean of all data.
How to dispose of print devices and toner owned by a department
Follow these steps if your department needs to dispose of a print device (including MFDs, copiers, scanners, fax machines, and desktop printers) or excess toner drums and cartridges (new or used):

Contact your Department Property Administrator (DPA); your local DPA can be found in the DPA Directory.Note: Departments cannot sell, donate or transfer equipment to individuals or non-Stanford entities. The disposal process is handled by Stanford Surplus. For more information, see the Stanford Administrative Guide Section 5.2.4, Surplus Property Sales.
If the print device your department owns has a current service or maintenance agreement that must be cancelled, follow the cancellation instructions below.

How to cancel device leases and service or maintenance agreements
To cancel the lease on printers, the department should work directly with the supplier to make the necessary arrangements, such as providing written notice of cancellation and coordinating the return of the equipment. The process typically involves following the terms and conditions outlined in the lease agreement, including any required notice period. Departments will be responsible for any costs associated with the cancellation of their agreement. Ensuring clear communication and documenting all interactions can help facilitate a smooth cancellation process."

FAQs



What is the Adobe ETLA license agreement and who are eligible?
Negotiated by University IT, the new Enterprise Term License Agreement (ETLA) provides the opportunity to purchase one-year subscription licenses for Adobe Creative Cloud and Acrobat Pro at significantly discounted costs. The new licenses are available to all university faculty, staff and students using the software for Stanford work.


If my current Adobe ID license is about to expire, when should I purchase the new license under the new ETLA agreement?
Adobe provides a 30-day grace period between your current license expiration and its cancellation. To continue service without interruption, you must purchase your new license under the ETLA agreement prior to end of the grace period.


Do dual boot systems, or systems with two operating systems, require two licenses?
Yes, systems with dual boot systems require two licenses.


How many active devices are allowed for a named user license?
Each license is allowed two active devices. However, an active device can be changed or deactivated to use another device.


If someone has a perpetual license and gets a new license under the university-wide agreement, what happens to the perpetual license?
A perpetual license is owned for life, provided they have a machine that will still run those older versions of the applications. The ETLA license will not overwrite an application installed with a perpetual license or require you delete it.


If I purchase Creative Cloud 2019 from the webstore, can I install a previous version?
Yes, you can install a previous version by following these instructions.

For more specific questions about how to scan, fax or copy, see the Scan, Fax, or Copy section of this FAQ page.

Where do I place my Stanford ID Card to log in to the device?
You must place your Stanford ID card or mobile keyon the card reader to badge in. Card reader locations vary depending on the device model:

CP Cardinal (C5550i - older model) — to the left of the LCD panel (see card location on image A)
CP Cardinal, CP Marguerite, CP Tressider — to the right of the LCD panel (see card location on image C)
CP Co-Ho — to right of the document feeder (see card location on image B)






Can I log in to a Cardinal Print device without my Stanford ID?
Yes, you can log in with your mobile key or by touching the touchscreen where it says “touch here to begin,” and entering your SUNet ID and password.
Why do I have to badge in / sign in to use Cardinal Print?

When you send a document to print, Cardinal Print holds it in a secure print queue for 72 hours. The document does not print during that time until you go to any Cardinal Print device, tap your SU ID, mobile key, or enter your network credentials on the screen, and select Print Release. The advantages of badging in include:

Security. Using your SU ID, mobile key, or SUNet ID and password to print the document ensures that your printout is secure,because a document will not print until you log in at the device. You do not need to rush to a printer to pick up a sensitive document after you send it to print.
Convenience. It only takes a moment to swipe your badge at the device. If you forget your badge, you can still print by logging in with your mobile key or network credentials at the device. Additionally, you can pick up your printout at any Cardinal Print  device by “badging in” (Print Anywhere)!

For detailed printing instructions, see How to Print a Document on a Cardinal Print Device.

My University ID card is not working when I try to badge in to Cardinal Print. What do I do?

The Cardinal Print program is accessible for Stanford University faculty, staff, contractors, and students with active Stanford affiliations. If you are an active faculty, staff, contractor, or student and your card is not allowing you access to Cardinal Print, here are some solutions and tips that can help:

Remove your card from your lanyard or wallet and place it on the card reader separately. The card reader may try to read other cards and this will cause interference. (Examples: Clipper Card, School of Medicine ID, building access badge, apartment fob)The old cards had a read range of about 15 inches and could work with some obstruction such as a wallet or purse. The new chips are more secure and have a read range of only about 3 to 4 inches. They don’t work well with obstructions and will not work through most wallets or purses. If you keep your card in a holder with your Clipper Card or hospital badge, you will need to pull the card from the holder to use with a card reader. Another suggestion is to keep the card in a separate holder but on the same clip.
Only your Stanford University ID card is compatible with the Cardinal Print card reader. Other cards like School of Medicine or recreation center cards will not work. If needed, request a Stanford University ID card.
If your University ID was issued before 2016, you may need a new card. To determine if you need a new card, look at the number on the back of your card at the bottom. If there is an ""-E"" in the number, (e.g., 6*123456-E) then you do not need a new card. If there is no ""-E"" in the number, (e.g., 123456, or 6*123456) then you do need a new card.
You can always touch the screen to enter your SUNet ID and Password using the keypad provided. If needed, request a new Stanford University card.

Note: If you bring your current card with you to pick up your new card, you won't be charged for the replacement.

Does Cardinal Print support Apple iOS (iPhone or iPad) devices?

Yes, you can submit an attached document via email to cardinalprint@stanford.edu or upload via the web to https://cardinalprintcenter.stanford.edu.
Currently, no driver or app store application is supported for iOS.

How do I get a print driver for Cardinal Print?

Most Cardinal Print users automatically receive a Cardinal Print driver through Stanford's Endpoint Configuration Management service (BigFix). If you do not have the driver, you can download one from the Cardinal Print website.

When I download the driver to my Apple macOS device, why do I see a dialog box asking me to allow the download?
If you have never downloaded anything from the uit.stanford.edu website to your macOS device (not iOS), you will see a dialog box asking if you will allow the download from this website. Select Allow to continue with the download.
How do contractors gain access to Cardinal Print?

A department administrator will need to visit the Contractor-Vendor ID Card webpage to request a Stanford ID card for the contractor, and be sure to state that the contractor will need access to Cardinal Print. 

How do I use Cardinal Print with a Linux device?

Although there is no Linux print driver available for Cardinal Print, you can add a Cardinal Print LPD printer. Just ensure your SUNet ID is specified with your print jobs.:
//as-mpsrwc-prd.stanford.edu/CardinalPrintLinux
Here is an example adding the LPD printer using shell commands:
lpadmin -pcardinalprintlinuxprd -E -v lpd://as-mpsrwc-prd.stanford.edu/CardinalPrintLinux
Additionally, you can print a single document using shell commands, such as this example:
<SUNet account>@psprcuat50> date;lp -d cardinalprintlinuxprd test.txt
You can also print from a Linux device by uploading a document to the Cardinal Print Center or by sending it to print via email (mobile printing).

Why do I see an extra pop-up login screen when I use Cardinal Print?

When you use a Mac computer, or a PC that is not Stanford domain-joined, you see an additional pop-up login screen at the beginning of each session. This pop-up appears after you log out of or restart your computer.
If you have a PC, you can have the computer joined to the Stanford domain. Consult your desktop support team to determine whether this is an option. Although there is no workaround for the Mac computer, our team is currently investigating a permanent solution to this issue.

How can I update the saved SUNet ID I use to log in to Cardinal Print on my Mac?
Follow these steps to clear the information saved on your Mac.
Can I log in to several Cardinal Print devices at the same time?
For security reasons, you can only log in to one Cardinal Print device at a time.
Is Mobile Key compatible with Cardinal Print?
Yes, Mobile Key is compatible with Cardinal Print! Mobile Key is the expanded functionality of Stanford Mobile ID, allowing you to use your phone as a digital key card in place of your physical Stanford ID card to access open doors, retrieve print jobs at Cardinal Print devices, and more. Click here to learn more about Mobile Key. 
Important notes about Mobile Key: 
*The first time you log into any Cardinal Print device, badge in with a physical card or by entering in your SUNet ID and Password. Once you've logged into a Cardinal Print device in one of these two ways, your SUNet will be registered and you will be able to log in using your Mobile Key within 1 hour and going forward.* After installing Mobile Key on your phone, it takes 24 hours for Mobile Key to fully activate and work with all card readers, including Cardinal Print card readers.  * Deleting and reinstalling the Stanford Mobile application will cause a new mobile key to be issued, and will take 24 hours for Mobile Key to become active as well.* After transitioning to a new phone, Mobile Key will appear to have transitioned over, but will not work. In this case, you will need to delete the Stanford Mobile App, reboot your device, reinstall the Stanford Mobile application, and activate Mobile Key again.

How do I finish printing a job after it has been interrupted?

If your print job is interrupted while you are printing (i.e., paper jam, out of paper, or toner), and you are not able to correct the problem before the device logs out of your account, the job will be canceled for security reasons. To continue printing, you will need to resend your print job and use the print settings to start on the page where you left off.

Can I plug a USB device into a USB port on a Cardinal Print device to print?
No. USB devices are disabled to prevent write access of PHI to unencrypted USB storage devices. USB devices are also disabled to prevent the spread of malware via infected USB flash drives and other portable storage, per industry best practices.
I need to print a document on specialized paper, labels, or envelopes (manual printing). How do I do this with Cardinal Print?

For instructions on printing on these media types, see How to Print Manually with Cardinal Print. If you are printing labels, follow these steps:

Make sure you are using labels designed for laser printers, not inkjet printers.
Use a full sheet of labels. If a label is missing from a sheet, a pocket is created on the sheet and the device could jam.
Load labels face up in the multi-purpose tray.
Make sure you select Labels as the paper type at the device.
Only use the multi-function tray to print labels. If labels are placed in the paper drawers, they may be curled during feeding and detach from the sheet.


Why are my color documents printing in black and white and double-sided?
Black-and-white printing and double-sided printing are default settings for Cardinal Print. To print a document in color or single-sided, change the print settings when you send the document to print. If you print from the online Cardinal Print Center, you can change the print settings for a document in the Print Options section in the bottom right of the screen. You can create a customized Print Profile that populates frequently used print settings such as printing 1-sided and color by following these steps for Windows or these steps for Mac.

Department billing

How does my department pay for Cardinal Print?
Cardinal Print costs for both devices and impressions are integrated with University IT billing and billed monthly. The Cardinal Print Usage & Allotment Billing Application allows for departments to run monthly usage reports as well as set up printing allowances for student workers, or for faculty and staff to bill to multiple PTAs for grants and special projects.
What do department administrators need to do to enable faculty, staff, or students to print using department funds?

Departments must set up at least one PTA to be billed for all printing costs of faculty and staff whose primary affiliation is with that department. It is up to the department to determine how they will set up the PTA or PTAs for billing. You must designate at least one PTA for all staff in your department without a dollar limit, to be used for faculty and staff whose primary affiliation is in your organization. PTAs can be set up at any level of the org, and all orgs under the designated org will roll up for billing purposes.
You can also provide faculty, staff, and students access to your PTA or multiple PTAs at the user level. This allows departments to allot printing dollars to faculty, staff, and students for particular PTAs. Common examples of users in this category are temporary or part-time employees, student workers, graduate students, or research assistants. This method requires access to the new CP Billing allocation application, which you can request access to.
Once an additional PTA is added for a faculty, staff, or student they will be presented with a choice after badging into a Cardinal Print device.

Do faculty and staff need to have a PTA allotment in order to print?

Administrators will not need to enter a PTA allotment for your faculty and staff. Schools and departments will set up a PTA at the org level to which printing by faculty and staff (including post docs) will be charged.

Do staff and faculty in my department have unlimited printing?

Yes, if they were set up with the org level PTA then there is no limit on the amount they can print. However, you can still log into the CP Billing Allocation App at any time to view usage reports and see who is printing, when, and how much under your PTA.

Can a user still print if they reach their allotment limit?

Yes, if a user does not have enough funding left in their PTA allotment, they will be able to complete the current print job or set of copies by selecting a different cost center. For example, if a user prints 3 pages, but can only pay for 2, they will be able to print 2 pages, and will be prompted to log out and log back in to select another billing option and print the 3rd page.When a PTA Allotment is fully used it will no longer be provided as a billing option. If you decide to increase or decrease the allotment for a user, the change will take place the next time the user logs back in to a Cardinal Print device.

Can I view reports to see who is printing and charging to my department PTA?

Yes, you can generate and view Cardinal Print usage reports via the Cardinal Pring Billing Allocation Application in Oracle Financials. You will be able to see who is printing to your designated PTA(s), when they are printing, and how much they are printing. To do so, request access to the billing app.

Can a user set up with a usage PTA have free printing, or will the amount have to be updated frequently?

In the Cardinal Print Allotment & Usage Application, “Amount” and “Start date” are both required when adding access to a user outside of your organization or department. In order to set a user up with “free printing” you can set a very large dollar amount, like $9999. Alternatively, you can log into the Cardinal Print Allotment & Usage Application and update the amount periodically and the change will take place as soon as you have saved it.

What if someone accidentally selects the wrong usage PTA when printing or making copies? How can this be fixed?

These types of mistakes may happen from time to time. Your Finance team should be notified and can correct the error through journal allocations. Departments can determine whether it is worth doing the journal allocation based on the amount.

If I give students access to a PTA for Cardinal Print, will they be able to charge other costs to it? Will I need to ask our finance team to create a new PTA just for Student printing?

Giving students access to your PTA for Cardinal Print will NOT allow them to use this PTA for any other purpose. You will not be required to create a new PTA just for student printing.

How do we renew our department's Cardinal Print device contract?

At the end of the contract period, the Cardinal Print team will work with you to assess printing needs and facilitate the renewal or update of devices for the next contract term.

What if our department ends our Cardinal Print contract early?

If you decide to remove or relinquish Cardinal Print devices prior the contract expiration, a written notice must be provided to the Cardinal Print team at least 14 business days prior to the intended removal or relinquishment date, by submitting Help request
Your department will be accountable for the following:

Locating an Alternative Location: making reasonable efforts to find and secure an alternative location within your department for the Cardinal Print devices.
Collaboration with Cardinal Print Team: If an alternative location cannot be found, please collaborate with the Cardinal Print team to explore options and identify a department willing to assume the remainder of the contract term.
Payment Obligation: If an alternative location or reach an agreement with the Cardinal Print team before the specified removal date is not secured, the department is responsible for the financial terms of the contract for its remaining duration. This includes, but not limited to, payment of any monthly amounts under the contract, such as lease fees, maintenance costs, and other associated charges.

What are “default settings” and why are they mandatory?

Default settings are standard settings for the Cardinal Print program to support the environmental, financial, productivity, and customer satisfaction goals. Through these settings, your department may realize significant savings and efficiencies that support our program goals. Cardinal Print has two default settings:

Double-sided printing
Black-and-white printing

These default settings reduce the costs and related supplies associated with single-sided printing and color printing.

If I don’t like the default settings, can I opt out of them?

These settings have a positive impact on Stanford and our environment and finances. However, all users will always have the option to override any of the settings manually on a print-by-print basis via the device properties. If your department truly needs to opt out of default settings, please submit a Help request.

Why does the device print my document in black and white and double sided?

Black-and-white printing and double-sided printing are default settings for Cardinal Print. These default settings help save toner, paper, and energy and contribute to the sustainability of the Cardinal Print program. If you need to print a document single-sided or in color, you can change the print settings on your computer when you send a document to print. If you print from the online Cardinal Print Center, you can change the print settings in the Print Options section in the bottom right of the screen. Learn more about changing print defaults for Windows computers or Mac computers.

What type and size of paper is provided by Cardinal Print?

Paper provided for Cardinal Print is 20lb, 30% recycled white paper in 8.5x11, 8.5 x14, and 11x17 sizes.Your department can order specialty paper (hole punched, color, glossy, etc...) as needed to be used in your Cardinal Print device.

How are paper and toner managed with Cardinal Print?

The Cardinal Print team will keep paper stocked in one of the cabinets closest to the device (Main campus) and each device’s anchor point(Redwood City campus); you can add paper to the device as needed. When toner runs low on a device, the Cardinal Print team is automatically notified and a representative will change the toner. 

What if my specific workflow requires a different device than the one we currently have?
If changes within the work environment or specific workflows are needed, new devices or capabilities can be requested, or legacy devices approved. These instances require an exception and approval. Submit a Help request to discuss options with our Cardinal Print team.
How do we remove our existing printing devices when our department transitions to Cardinal Print?

The Cardinal Print team will not coordinate the removal of your current device(s). Click here for instructions and more information on removal and pick up of any current devices.

I need to move my device to a new location. Should I call anyone in advance?

Cardinal Print devices must be moved by the Cardinal Print team.  To request a device relocation, please complete a Help request. Within seven (7) business days of receiving the request, the Cardinal Print team will provide a cost estimate and timeline for the device move.
An additional fee of $280 per device per move will apply for each unauthorized relocation.

Sustainability

What is our current printer-to-user ratio?

In 2019, the printer-to-user ratio at Stanford is 2:3 (two printers for every three users). As part of Stanford’s long term sustainability goals, the Cardinal Print policy will help us to achieve a ratio closer to 1:12 (one device for every twelve users).

How can I help Stanford save money on printing?
See the Cardinal Print policy and adhere to the best practice recommendations.
Is an empty toner cartridge recycled?

Yes, the Cardinal Print team will recycle empty toner cartridges.


Print policy
For a full description of the Stanford University Print Policy, visit the Stanford University Print Policy page.

When did the Cardinal Print policy go into effect?

The Cardinal Print policy went into effect on February 1, 2021.

What is the purpose of a print policy at Stanford?

This policy supports the university’s stated long-term objectives regarding administrative functions including improving user experience, increasing efficiencies, mitigating security risks, achieving sustainability goals, and efficiently using financial resources.

How long will it take to implement Cardinal Print?

With the mandate announced to campus in February 2021, the Cardinal Print team will work to create a schedule to deploy as quickly as possible. Those with expiring leases will be considered high priority. It is anticipated that the campus-wide implementation, including student and guest printing, will be a multi-year process.

What are the benefits of the new Cardinal Print policy?

Expected benefits include:

Reduce Stanford’s environmental impact: Reduce Stanford’s use of toner, paper, and energy. All devices are ENERGY STAR® and EPEAT® certified. Program supports our sustainability goals, including becoming 80% carbon free by 2025 and achieving zero waste by 2030.
Print securely: Authenticate with your badge or login with your SUNet ID and password at a Cardinal Print Canon multifunction device (MFD) to print your job when and where you want it. Approved for high risk and protected health information (PHI) data.
Print anywhere: Print securely from any device including your tablet or mobile device. Pick up your printout at any Cardinal Print Canon MFD.
Print quickly: Be more productive with new, upgraded MFDs.
Use advanced features: Scan directly to email, and staple to your printouts. 3-hole punching and scan to cloud functionality can be added to your service.


Why am I encouraged to get rid of my personal printer?

Personal printers (single-function devices) are a major security risk for individuals, departments, and the university. These risks include:

Vulnerability. An inadequately managed personal printer is easy to hack. Printers have software that needs to be properly configured and kept updated. Printers are one of the most commonly targeted devices; one-third of all cyber vulnerabilities across Stanford are associated with printers.
Compromised data. A hacker can use a compromised printer to bypass network firewall controls, access confidential documents and data from past print jobs, and attack other applications, systems, and networks.

Cardinal Print is Stanford’s recommended solution. The program ensures managed print devices are properly configured and maintained, replacing vulnerable printers with secure, multifunction devices and appropriately managed networks.

Will all machines be replaced with a Canon device? What about my personal printer?

Current print devices will be consolidated and replaced by multi-function devices provided by Canon Solutions America. Personal printers are not supported by the Cardinal Print Network. To learn more about the Cardinal Print program, please request a Cardinal Print assessment.

What will happen to inkjet printers, including those connected to medical devices?

Inkjet printers and other personal or single-function printers not connected to the Stanford network are allowed under the Cardinal Print policy.

Can my department opt to not participate in Cardinal Print?

The Cardinal Print program is a university-wide strategic initiative that makes printing more secure and sustainable and improves how departments manage their work processes. After numerous successful rollouts within different departments across campus, it is now the required print solution at Stanford. If you have specialized printing needs, the Cardinal Print team will work with you to ensure that your goals are met.

This sounds like a big change. How will you help my department adjust to Cardinal Print?

The Cardinal Print change management team provides consultations/assessments to understand your unique needs, personalized onboarding and training, instructional videos, and written instructions.

Desktop & Device Support,How to Back Up External Hard Drives in Code42 (Formerly CrashPlan),"On June 11, 2018, the CrashPlan service for the School of Medicine was upgraded. The newer version is expected to help with a variety of bugs which have been impacting some backups and restores. Please note that the branding for CrashPlan has been changed to ""Code42"" with this upgrade and the interface and icons have also changed.

Overview
You can use Code42 to back up storage connected to your computer, such as an external hard drive directly attached via USB, Thunderbolt, or Firewire. By adding the contents of an external drive to your backup file selection, Code42 backs it up just like other files on your computer.
Below are the steps to back up files stored on an external drive to another destination, such as CrashPlan Central or another computer, in both Code42 and CrashPlan. If you still have CrashPlan, your CrashPlan will be automatically updated to Code42.
Code42 (version 6.7.2)

Open the Code42 app.
Log in using your SUNet ID/SUNet ID password.
Click Details next to your computer.
Click Manage Files
Select the external drive and click Save.

CrashPlan (version 4.8.3)

Open the CrashPlan app.
Log in using your SUNet ID/SUNet ID password.
Select Backup > Change.
To back up the entire drive, check the box to the left of your external hard drive.
To select only specific files or folders for backup, click the triangle next to the drive to expand its contents, then browse the contents and select the items you want to back up.
Click Save.

Desktop & Device Support,Jamf @Stanford FAQS,"Below is a list of common questions and answers for Jamf @ Stanford.

On this page:
About Jamf at StanfordJamf for macOSJamf for iOS/iPadOS

Jamf @ Stanford
What is Jamf @ Stanford?Jamf is a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution for managing the Apple platform. With Jamf, we can proactively manage the entire lifecycle of all Apple devices. Lifecycle management for macOS includes deploying and maintaining software, responding to security threats, distributing settings, and analyzing inventory data.How does Jamf work?When a device enrolls with Jamf@Stanford, it uses the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to communicate directly with the Jamf MDM instance in the cloud to receive configurations. The experience between a device and IT changes as new opportunities are available. As the Stanford Jamf system matures, setup can begin when a device comes out of the box (known as zero-touch deployment) without a technical consultant's physical interaction. A client can decide what applications and settings they want from the application catalog (coming later) while essential updates install in the background without downtime. What information does Jamf collect?We've customized our implementation to collect only the data needed to support Stanford Mac devices and keep our networks and data safe. Jamf can:
View model, serial number, and operating systemIdentify your device by nameReset lost or stolen device to factory settingsView disk encryption statusView information for installed applications (e.g. log files, plist settings files)
For a complete list of attributes, Jamf can view for a computer, review the Managing Computers > Inventory for Computers > Computer Inventory Information Reference section of the latest version at the Jamf Pro Administrator’s Guide.What information does Jamf NOT collect?Jamf does not collect personal information, such as the contents or names of individual files (documents, email, etc.) or any browsing history. Jamf can't:
View browsing history on a deviceSee your personal emails, documents, contacts, or calendarAccess your passwordsView, edit, or delete photosView frequency of application useSee the location of a device

Jamf for macOS
Why has Stanford chosen Jamf to replace HCL BigFix on Stanford Macs?Due to security changes in recent versions of the macOS architecture, BigFix is no longer adequately performing the tasks needed to manage Apple's operating system. As we transition management systems to Jamf, BigFix will remain until Jamf provides management parity. The same teams who currently govern BigFix will manage Jamf.How do updates work?Jamf’s software updates and patching will usually be invisible to you. Software updates download to your computer in the background at a speed that allows your computer tasks to proceed without interruption or delay. App Store updates are installed daily around midnight, whereas third-party apps might have their own schedule. Microsoft apps are updated monthly and installed automatically if the programs are closed.Will I still have administrative access to my Mac?There will be no automatic changes to the privileges of your device.How do I know if Jamf is installed on my device?Open System Preferences > Profiles. From the list on the left, click on Stanford Device Management. On the right, you should see “Description: https://jamf.stanford.edu”.I received a Profile Installation Failed error message when trying to install Jamf. What does this mean?If you receive an error message stating “Profile installation failed,"" it’s likely your macOS device is already enrolled in Jamf, and no further action is required.In the MDM Profile, it shows in red text that Jamf has the ability to delete data from my computer. Should I be worried?For transparency reasons, Jamf’s capability as it relates to erasing data is displayed. This is a standard function of any device management system. Be assured that your data is safe and we will not take this action without your consent. This function is generally reserved for lost or stolen devices.What is Self-Service App?Included with Jamf enrollment or accessible via the App Store, Self-Service empowers end-users with access to University-approved applications and configurations through a click of a button. The highly customizable Self Service catalog features productivity, compliance, connectivity software, and more. You can install software or quickly configure your device without IT intervention by launching Self Service from your Applications folder. Some groups might see the Self-Service icon on their desktop. Visit the Jamf website to learn more about Apple self-service.
Jamf for iOS/iPadOS
What if I don't want device management?Device management is required to:
Access the Stanford network while on campusUse Cardinal Key
If you are certain that the implications of having an unmanaged device will not impact you, you may remove management from a non-Stanford purchased device by navigating to mydevices.stanford.edu and following these instructions for removing your device from MDM.I received a Profile Installation Failed error message when trying to install the Jamf profile. What does this mean?You received a pop-up error message that says: “The new MDM payload does not match the old payload.” because you already have a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile installed. You can only have one MDM on your device at a time.To resolve this, navigate to Settings, Open the Profile of the installed Mobile Device Management and select Remove Management. You can then enroll in the new Device provider (Jamf) and download that profile. My device is new or otherwise unmanaged. How do I enroll it into Jamf?If your device is new or unmanaged, follow these instructions to enroll in Jamf.What is Self-Service App?Included with Jamf enrollment or accessible via the App Store, Self-Service gives you access to a curated set of university-approved applications and configurations. The customizable Self-Service catalog features productivity, compliance, connectivity software, and more. You can install software or quickly configure your device without IT intervention by launching Self-Service from your mobile device.

Desktop & Device Support,How do I register a new School of Medicine printer for network printing?,"Printers that are network-capable need to be registered for network access just like computers. Please note that printers should only be connected to the network via an Ethernet cable - printers should not be connected to the Stanford wireless network.
Before registering printer, work with University IT to see if Cardinal Print is available in desired location as an option.
To register a printer, follow the steps below. If you have any trouble with these steps, please call IRT at (650) 725-8000 or file a HelpSU ticket.

Obtain the printer's physical address (also called MAC, hardware, or ethernet address)

This can be done by printing a configuration page on most network-capable printers. Many printers have an LCD screen and buttons to navigate menu options. Printing a configuration page is usually in the Information menu under Configuration Page or in the Reports menu under Configuration page.


Set the printer for DHCP

Most network-capable printers ship with a default setting of obtaining an IP address via DHCP (BootP can also be used if DHCP is not available). This can be verified through the configuration page printed in step 1. The manner in which the printer obtains its IP address can be changed through the LCD menu by navigating to the configuration section for the network and setting the configuration method to DHCP.


Call (650) 725-8000 and provide the following information:

Building and room number of the printer
Physical/hardware address of the printer (from step 1)
Make and model of printer
SUNet ID of the printer’s administrator
Department to whom the printer belongs



The technician you speak with should give you the IP address after the printer is registered.The printer should then be registered within 15-20 minutes. After this, you may need to reboot the printer for it to obtain its IP address. We recommend that you tape a piece of paper with the printer's IP address on the printer for easy reference.

Introduction
Password rules
Pass phrases
Change/reset password
What the system looks for



Introduction
One of the potentially weakest links in computer security is the individual password. Despite the University's efforts to keep hackers out of your personal files and away from Stanford-only resources (e.g., email, web files, licensed software), easily-guessed passwords are still a big problem.
Stanford implements a strict password checking system for SUNet IDs to combat this problem. Each time you open a new account or change (reset your password, the system will prevent you from setting a password that is easily cracked. 
In addition, Stanford now recommends ""pass phrases"" instead of passwords. Pass phrases are longer, but easier to remember than complex passwords, and if well-chosen can provide better protection against hackers.
People who work in organizations which are a part of the ""Covered Entity"" under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) should reset their SUNet ID password if there is a security concern. Explore the Stay Safe From Phishing Scams website for tips on how to recognize, report, and stay vigilant about phishing scams.
Password rules
Stanford's password rules, based on password length, are:

8-11: mixed case letters, numbers, & symbols
12-15: mixed case letters & numbers
16-19: mixed case letters
20+: no restrictions
It must not be equal to your current password, previous passwords, SUNet ID, or password reset answer
It must not be a single word that appears in the dictionary (English or non-English)
It must be composed only of characters in the Roman alphabet, numbers, or symbols on the US keyboard. Examples include characters such as # $ % ! @.

Consider using four or more unrelated words with mixed capitalization, separated by punctuation or spaces. If you have trouble remembering a longer password, write it down on a piece of paper, put the paper in your wallet, and use the same caution with it as you would with a credit card.
Creating a pass phrase
A pass phrase is basically just a series of words, which can include spaces, that you employ instead of a single pass ""word."" Pass phrases should be at least 16 to 25 characters in length (spaces count as characters), but no less. Longer is better because, though pass phrases look simple, the increased length provides so many possible permutations that a standard password-cracking program will not be effective. It is always a good thing to disguise that simplicity by throwing in elements of weirdness, nonsense, or randomness. Here, for example, are a couple pass phrase candidates:

pizza with crispy spaniels
mangled persimmon therapy

Punctuate and capitalize your phrase:

Pizza with crispy Spaniels!
mangled Persimmon Therapy?

Toss in a few numbers or symbols from the top row of the keyboard, plus some deliberately misspelled words, and you'll create an almost unguessable key to your account:

Pizza w/ 6 krispy Spaniels!
mangl3d Persimmon Th3rapy?

Authentication,How to Create a SUNet ID From a Sponsorship Invitation,"Your SUNet ID is an account name that identifies you, uniquely and permanently, as a member of the Stanford community. You'll use it to log into most secure online services; your access to specific online services is determined by your eligibility and affiliation with Stanford. Your SUNet ID is used by many Stanford business systems and cannot be easily changed, so choose one that you will be confident to say aloud to professors, managers, and colleagues. If you qualify for a Stanford email address, your default email address will be your-sunetid@stanford.edu. See the SUNet IDs in Detail page for more information about policies and services.
Create a SUNet ID
Your Stanford sponsor begins the process by entering personally identifiable information such as your full name and date of birth into the Stanford system. When your sponsor's task is complete, you'll receive an email inviting you to choose a SUNet ID and password.
To set up your SUNet ID:

Open the invitation email from your sponsor. Click the link in the invitation, or visit accounts.stanford.edu, click the Create SUNet ID tile, and follow the directions in your invitation to enter your registration ID manually.
On the Create SUNet ID page, enter your Registration ID and click Verify.
Enter your last name and date of birth, then click Next.
Enter a valid non-Stanford email address.
On the Choose SUNet ID page, type your desired SUNet ID. After two failed attempts, the system will suggest available SUNet IDs. If you choose a SUNet ID that isn't available, the system will ask you to choose another. Remember to select a SUNet ID that you will be proud to say aloud to a professor, manager, or co-worker. Those who receive a Stanford email address will be assigned your-sunetid@stanford.edu. Click Next.
Click each box to acknowledge that you agree to the policies and terms. If you don't like your SUNet ID, click Choose Another SUNet ID; this is your last chance to change it. When you're satisfied with your SUNet ID, click Next. Then click I Understand to confirm your SUNetID.
On the Choose Password page, enter a password that complies with the requirements listed on the right side of the page. Choose a ""Password Reset Question"" and enter an answer that you can easily remember in the Answer field. Click Submit.
Your SUNet ID and password are now set. You should have access to the Stanford system within 24 hours or on the date specified in your invitation email.Note: You must know your SUNet ID and password to log in to most secure online services. If you forget your password, go to accounts.stanford.edu, click the Password Management tile, then click Forgot Password. 
If you don't have access within 24 hours or on the date specified in your invitation email, please submit a Help ticket."
Authentication,How to Close Your SUNet ID Account: Students and Graduates,"Overview
This page summarizes what happens to your email and other online services after you are no longer enrolled at Stanford (e.g. a leave of absence, graduation). You may have found your way here because you received notification that your SUNet ID account will soon close. This page helps you determine what ""your account is closing"" means to you, and what you need to do.
Depending upon when and why you leave Stanford, your SUNet ID account services will change or end. You are given a grace period to help you during this transition. Access ends or changes when the grace period expires (see table, below).
Account expiration and grace period
Students



Leave of Absence

Students who are granted an official leave of absence by the Registrar's Office maintain their full service SUNet ID for the length of their leave of absence.



Other

When you transfer or leave the university for other reasons (besides a leave of absence or graduation), your account enters a 120-day grace period. If at the end of this grace period your affiliation has not been reactivated, your SUNet ID account services, including email, will end. However, the Stanford Alumni Association provides free, permanent Alumni email accounts* to students who have spent three quarters or more in a degree-granting program.
*GSB graduates only: if you are leaving the Stanford GSB after three or more quarters, please contact sbsaa@gsb.stanford.edu.




Graduates



Graduated in the last five years

When you graduated, your account entered a 120-day grace period.  This will allow you continued access to your @stanford.edu email, access to licensed electronic resources while on campus and on a Stanford network; however, off-campus access to electronic resources stops when you graduate, visit Stanford Libraries for details.
Your Stanford directory listing (StanfordWho) will no longer appear. You will not be able to log into the Stanford view of StanfordWho.
120 days after you graduate, your account will change to a base level account. This base level account is good for five years, giving you access to your transcripts and other online information, but not to @stanford.edu email. Email access ends when the grace period ends, and any email left on the university mail servers will be deleted. However, you are eligible for a permanent Stanford Alumni email account* if you qualify under the Stanford Alumni Association definition of “alumni”, i.e., have completed 3 or more quarters in a Stanford degree-granting programs.
If you are eligible for and create an alumni account, new email sent to your @stanford.edu address after it closes is sent automatically to your @alumni.stanford.edu address for two years. Set up autoreply for your @stanford.edu email address at any point during those two years to notify others of your new @alumni.stanford.edu address.
*GSB graduates only: visit GSB Stay Connected for details about GSB alumni email options and information on managing your existing email, contacts, calendar, and docs before your account closes. If you create an account prior to the end of the 120 day grace period, new email sent to your @stanford.edu address, after it closes, will automatically forward to @alumni.gsb.stanford.edu for two years.



Graduated more than five years ago

If you graduated more than five years ago, your SUNet ID account is inactive. You are eligible for a permanent Stanford Alumni email account if you qualify under the Stanford Alumni Association definition of “alumni”, i.e., have completed 3 or more quarters in a Stanford degree-granting programs.




Postdoctoral Scholars  



When Appointment Ends

You have continued access to your Stanford email account for a 120-day grace period after your appointment ends.  Email access ends when the grace period ends, and any email left on the university mail servers will be deleted.        
Postdoctoral scholars in good standing may request that their Stanford email be forwarded to a personal account for 2 years after the end of their appointment.  For further information, please visit Postdoc Email Forwarding FAQs. Note that email cannot be sent from your Stanford email address during this period, nor are there storage capabilities.    
Your Stanford directory listing (StanfordWho) will no longer appear after your appointment ends, nor will you be able to log into the Stanford view of StanfordWho.

Depending upon your Stanford affiliation, your SUNet ID account services may change or end when you leave the university; see Account expiration and grace period, below.
To learn more about access to electronic information, see the Stanford Administrative Guide Section 6.1.1 Privacy and Access to Electronic Information.
Account expiration and grace period



Faculty
When your affiliation with Stanford ends, your SUNet account enters a 120-day grace period which bridges you between the end of one academic year and the start of the next. If, at the end of this grace period, your affiliation has not been reactivated (i.e., you have left the university), your SUNet services end.


Staff

Access to @stanford email and other online services ends on the last day of your employment. This includes access to those Stanford business systems for which your SUNet ID served as login ID (e.g., Axess, Oracle Financials, PeopleSoft Student Administration). If you need copies of personal email or files, be sure to make them in advance. You should change ownership of any Box, Google, and Office 365 documents that others may need access to after your employment ends.



Sponsored staff

If your SUNet account is sponsored (i.e., someone in the university has agreed to pay for you to use SUNet services for a fixed period of time) your sponsored services end when your sponsorship ends. You will receive email reminders 30 and 7 days before the expiration date of your sponsorship; use that time to either get your sponsorship renewed or to close your account.

Document Management & Collaboration,TDS - Common Medicine Box Issues and Their Resolutions/Workarounds,"KBB0010009SoM: Transfer Large Amounts of Data to Med Box

Below is a list of some common Medicine Box issues and their resolutions or workarounds.
Uploading
Logging In
Quarantined Files
Mobile Devices
Sharing
Virtual Machines (VMs)
Note: As of 12/27/2019, it will no longer be possible to upload a folder in Box, using IE 11. Alternatives would include using a modern/supported browser, or Box Drive (or using IE to upload a file at a time)
Unable to upload file to Box or create a folder in Box
This issue can be caused by several things, depending on where you run into this issue. Please always try uploading the data directly to the Box website if you are having problems with Box Sync or Box Drive, as even if it fails it will provide more information as to why.

Insufficient Permissions to Upload File/You do not have permission to upload to this folder: This is typically caused by uploading at the top level of Box. The places where you can create new data or upload is limited to within folders that have been shared to you (you will need any permissions level which includes Upload), your externally shareable files folder, and your files folder marked Safe for PHI & PII.
File Size Exceeded: Box currently has a hard file size limit of 15GB for what can be uploaded. If possible, please break up the file into smaller files if it is only going to be used for archiving. If the data will need to be actively used from Box, then you may need to look for a different solution.
File Name Not Supported: Please see the Box Sync and Box Drive support articles on unsupported names.
Unsupported File Type: There are specific files types that Box will not allow to be uploaded through Box Drive or Box Sync. The workaround is to upload the files through the web.

Unable to log into the Medicine Box Website

Device Not Fully Secure:

There are multiple causes for this specific error:

This can be caused by your computer not being encrypted. Stanford Medicine Box can only be accessed by computers that have been encrypted. This includes all internal disks. For more detail, please see our How to Fix ""Device Not Fully Secure"" Error in Medicine Box article.
This error will also appear if you have unencrypted external media connected, such as a flash drive, CD/DVD, external drive, or Google File Stream.
To use both Box and Google File Stream simultaneously, download Box Drive, ensure it works fine, then install Google Drive File Stream. Your Box Drive connection and Google Drive File Stream will remain working. If Medicine Box folder permissions need to be done, disconnect the Google Drive File Stream, then launch a private browser to access Medicine Box. 
If none of these apply, please contact the IRT Service Desk for further assistance at (650) 725-8000




Browser Version or Configuration:

One of the causes for this is if you are using either Safari, Internet Explorer, or Edge. Please note that at this time Microsoft Edge cannot be used to access Medicine Box.

For Internet Explorer, please see Box's Internet Explorer Configuration Guide.
For Safari, please see the Safari section of the Box Tools Install Guide.


This can also be caused by the web browser being out of date. You can check to see if your browser is up to date by going to settings and then about [your browser].


Problem Determining Device Security:

This can happen if there is an issue with Box Tools/Edit running on your computer.
A restart of the computer will typically get Box Tools/Edit to work again, which will allow you to sign in.

Another solution can be to uninstall Box Tools/Edit, restart the computer, and then install the latest version by logging in again and downloading and installing when prompted.
This issue can also be caused by a combination of the errors above so if the issue is not resolved by the re-installation of Box Tools/Edit, please try the other troubleshooting steps above, or reach out to the TDS Service Desk at (650) 725-8000.




Invalid Login Credentials:

This is caused by logging into the incorrect portal for Box. Please see our Stanford Medicine Box: ""Invalid login credentials"" Error article or not having opted in for a Stanford Medicine Box account


You currently do not have a Stanford Medicine Box account:

This can be fixed by opting in to the Stanford Medicine Box instance. Please see our You May Need to Opt in to Use Medicine Box article.

If you had a Medicine Box account in the past, but are missing data after opting-in and signing into Medicine Box, please reach out to the TDS Service Desk at (650) 725-8000.





Quarantined files

For quarantined files, you can download the files that have been quarantined and then move them to a folder that is marked ""Safe for PHI & PII"". You can then remove yourself from the Quarantine folder. For more information, or how to proceed if you believe this is a false positive, please see our My File Has Been Quarantined by Stanford Medicine Box article.

Deleted files

If you delete a file by mistake and are unable to find it, please check the Trash folder.  Stanford Medicine Box is actually configured to keep deleted files for 90 days in the trash unless you manually empty the trash folder)

Unable to log into Box on a mobile device

Disabled by Administrator: This is caused by using the incorrect version of the Box app to access Medicine Box.

For instructions on installing Box for EMM for Android please see our How to Install Stanford Medicine Box for Android article.
For instructions on installing Box for EMM for iOS please see our How to Install Stanford Medicine Box for iOS (iPhone/iPad) article.



Unable to share folders/files to users

ACTION REQUIRED: A new Box collaboration created with a user outside of Stanford Medicine Box was not allowed:

This is caused by sharing a folder that is tagged as ""Safe for PHI & PII"" to an individual that is outside of the Stanford Medicine Box instance. If you receive this error and the individual is with Stanford, please have them opt-in to Stanford Medicine Box. Or, if the to-be-shared data is not High Risk, you could also consider moving the data into an Externally Shareable Files folder.


Receiving an email about a collaboration, but the link in the email doesn't go to the new content:

This is typically caused by a file/folder being shared to an alias email address.

A workaround is to share the file/folder to the user's SUNet ID or full name.
A solution is to have that individual add their alias email address to Stanford Medicine Box. They can do this under their profile once they have logged into Stanford Medicine Box. For more information for how to do so, please see our How to Link Your Email Alias to Medicine Box article.





Unable to open files in Windows

Filename is not valid, filename could not be found, or the file could not be accessed:

These errors are typically caused by the total file path being too long (too many characters) for Windows to understand.

The workaround is to rename the folders to shorter names.
The fix for the issue (only for Windows 10 computers) is to enable Long Path. Instructions can be found on Microsoft's Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces support document under the section for Maximum Path Length Limitation.





Adding Medicine Box Drive/Sync to a Virtual Machine

When accessing Box Drive/Sync on a VM, it needs to be handled in one of two ways:

Encrypt and password protect the VM: This can be done by manually enabling BitLocker on a Windows system or by enabling FileVault on a Mac system. You must also have a password set for the account you are logging into for the VM.
If the hosting computer is already compliant, you can install Box Drive/Sync, then go into the Virtual Machine hosting program and select to share the folder labeled Box or Box Sync. As long as the host machine has Box Drive/Sync running and signed in, you will be able to access the folders and files through the shared folder list."

Document Management & Collaboration,Install Box Drive for Mac,"Overview
Box Drive brings your entire Box folder tree to your desktop. All of the files you have on Box are accessible from your desktop Box folder. Your content is streamed directly to your desktop, so you can access all of your files without using much hard drive space. Box Drive includes a search feature that allows you to search all of the files you have stored in Box. And, Box Drive is integrated into Windows Explorer and Mac Finder so you do not have to access a separate application to access your files.
System requirements

1. Download the install package from the Box download page. 
2. Double-click the install package file called Box.pkg.
3. In the Install Box window, click Continue.
4. Follow the prompts in the install wizard to install Box Drive. When the installation is successful, click Close.
5. A pop-up window appears to sign into your Box account. Sign in with your Stanford email address (SUNetID@stanford.edu) and click Next.

Document Management & Collaboration,Drive for desktop,"You can install Drive for desktop on your Windows or Mac computer as soon as you have access to Google Drive on the web. Drive for desktop is a desktop application that lets you stream My Drive and Shared drives files directly from the cloud.
Features

Frees up disk space and network bandwidth.
Decreases sync time.
Minimizes the amount of company data stored on users’ hard drives.

With Drive for desktop, you can open and edit most document types directly out of Drive for desktop without having to download the file onto your computer. When you make edits to the file, the changes are automatically saved in My Drive.
You can also make My Drive and Shared drives files available for offline access. These cached files sync back to the cloud when you are online, so the latest version is available on all your devices.
Get started

Step by step installation instructions for Windows and Mac

Limitations/Known issues
There are a few limitations and known issues with using Drive for desktop.
Shared drives file editing
If you share a document in a Shared drive with a person who is not a member of that Shared drives, that person will only have the ability to “edit” the file. Shared drives editors cannot edit any Shared drives files when they are open in Drive for desktop; they can only view them. To edit Shared drives files, the editor must open the file in Google Shared drives in a web browser.
Notes: 

Starting July 19, 2021: Backup and Sync will support a guided flow to help users transition onto Drive for desktop.
Starting Aug. 18, 2021: Any users still on Backup and Sync will start to receive in-product notifications prompting them to transition to Drive for desktop.
Starting Oct. 1, 2021: Any users still on Backup and Sync will no longer be able to sign in to Backup and Sync. To continue syncing with Drive and/or Google Photos, users will need to transition to Drive for desktop."
Document Management & Collaboration,Google Shared drives FAQ,"What types of files can be added to Google Shared drives?
All file types can be added to a Shared drive, except Google Maps and existing documents with attached Apps Scripts.
Can I move a folder from My Drive to a Shared drive?
No. You cannot move folders from a My Drive to a Shared drive. You can only move files, but you can move multiple files at once. For more information and instructions see Migrate Files to Google Shared drives.
Can I sync files to my computer?
No, currently the laptop/desktop Google Drive sync tool does not sync files stored in Shared drives. If you are the owner of a large share in your My Drive and you use Google Drive sync tool to sync files to and from your desktop or laptop machine, you will not be able to sync the files if you move them to a Shared drive. Google recently released Google File Stream for enterprise and educational institutions.
Can I use a Drive Volume Letter (e.g. G:) for my Google Drive Sync Folder?
No. You cannot use a drive volume letter for your Shared drives files. This feature is expected in a future release of the Google Drive desktop application.
How long do files I delete stay in Trash?
Each Shared drive has its own trash. Files and folders in the Trash are deleted forever after 30 days. Team members can delete specific files sooner.
Can I restore deleted files?
Yes, you can restore deleted files if you have Edit access or full access."

Document Management & Collaboration,How to restrict a Google Form to Stanford users,"You can restrict a form so that only people logged into their Stanford Google account can fill it out. Follow these steps:

On the form, click the Settings option at the top.
Expand the Responses section to reveal options.
Enable ""Restrict to users in Stanford University and its trusted organizations"""
Document Management & Collaboration,Accessibility Best Practices When Creating Google Forms,"When creating forms through Google Forms, it’s important for your content to be web accessible to your audiences. This includes audiences with hearing or visual impairments who may rely on assistive technologies to both understand and interact with your web forms.  
Below are a few best practices to follow while creating forms through Google Forms. They’re as simple as adding descriptive context and thoughtful structure to allow everyone to understand and complete the tasks within your web form. 
Use sections
If your form is long, it’s good practice to use sections with clear headings to break it up into digestible, comprehensive chunks. Sections help reduce the stress of your reader and offer a good stopping point to take a break.
Describe response validation rules
Help users fill out your Google Forms through Response validation. Response validation allows you to create rules that users have to follow as they interact with your form. For example, if you want to limit an answer to be 500 characters or less, you would create a rule that will ensure the user enters a response that is less than 500 characters before they can move on in the form. 
To help users understand when a response is valid, include a description of format or other types of values you expect in the description field. 
Here’s an example of how: If you’re asking for a number between 1 and 10, add something like, “Please enter a number between 1 and 10” in the label or description for that field. For dates, provide the format expected (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy) in the description so that users will enter the date in a format that is valid. 

Avoid using images as part of questions
Google forms allows you to use an image as part of a question, but does not allow you to describe that image for non-sighted users, which renders the question inaccessible. It’s therefore best not to use images as part of your questions, and to use text options instead. If you need to use images for a question, make sure they are fully described as part of the question so someone who can’t see them can still answer the question based solely on the text.
Provide directions for linear scales
Screen readers read linear scale values (e.g., Satisfied, Dissatisfied) after reading each of the numbers. To make these easier to use, add the description of the scale in the question. For example: “On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being Satisfied and 10 being Dissatisfied, how do you…”"

Document Management & Collaboration,Microsoft 365 ProPlus,"DescriptionMicrosoft's Microsoft 365 ProPlus allows individuals with an Microsoft 365 account to install Microsoft Office on up to 5 Windows or Mac computers, 5 tablets, and 5 smartphones.The Microsoft Office applications that are available via ProPlus include Outlook, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote.System requirementsTo install Office 2016, you need Mac OS X 10.10 or later or Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or later.To use Microsoft 365 ProPlus, you must have an Microsoft 365 account and have been assigned a license. All current Stanford staff, faculty, and graduate students already have an Microsoft 365 account and are licensed. Once your license or account is removed, your installations of Microsoft 365 ProPlus will go into a reduced functionality mode. In this mode, current documents will still be available, but new documents cannot be created.Notes
	You must connect to the Internet at least once every 30 days to use the Office apps you have downloaded from ProPlus. This is so that the status of your Microsoft 365 subscriptions can be checked. If you don’t connect within 30 days, Microsoft 365 ProPlus goes into reduced functionality mode. After you connect to the Internet and your subscription status is verified, all the features of Microsoft 365 ProPlus are available again. If you know that you will be unable to connect to the Internet at least once every 30 days (for example, if you're traveling to a remote location), please submit a Help ticket to request a different method of obtaining Microsoft Office.
	
	To install individual Microsoft Office applications on a mobile device, you can go to the App Store for iOS or the Play Store for Android and search for Microsoft Office.
	
	ProPlus is intended for individual use, since it's tied to the Microsoft 365 license of the user. Do not use ProPlus to download software for groups or labs. IT professionals setting up Microsoft 365 for labs or groups should go to the Microsoft Products for Stanford IT Professionals page.
	
	Microsoft 365 ProPlus is not the same as Office Online. Office Online lets users open Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneNote documents in a web browser.

Document Management & Collaboration,Create a Google Shared drive,"Anyone can create a Google Shared drive and then add members and set permissions. You can designate a Google Group as the membership for a Shared drive. Using Workgroup Integration, you can create a Google Group from existing Stanford Workgroups. Below you will find instructions for creating and managing Google Groups and Shared drives.
Create a Google Group
One of the advantages of Google Shared drives is that the group owns all of the documents in the Shared drives, so even if one member leaves, all of the documents remain.  You can use Workgroup Integration to create a Google Group from current Workgroups. Once the permissions are granted to your Google Group, access to the Shared drives is automatically adjusted when you add or remove members from your Stanford Workgroup, allowing you to manage access entirely from within Workgroup Manager.
To do this, follow the instructions on the Google Groups for Workgroups page to create a Google Group that you will then use as the owner of the Shared drives.

Allow up to 24 hours for the linked Google Group to appear on the Google Groups management site.
All administrators of the Workgroup become owners of the new Google Group.  All members of the Workgroup become members of the Google Group.
You can only use Workgroup Manager to maintain membership for Stanford users.  You can add non-Stanford users directly to the Shared drives within Google Apps.
When you create the Shared drives, you can name them anything you want and then in the membership list assign the Google Group name that the Workgroup Integration tool created, and give it Full access permission.  The Google Group name will be in the format stem_workgroup@stanford.edu.

Full access permission allows members full access to upload, edit, and delete files, as well as to invite other members to the Shared drives.
If you want some members of the Shared drives group to have only Edit, Comment, or View access, create separate Workgroups and then add those groups as members with the appropriate permissions.

Document Management & Collaboration,Google Shared drives Known Issues,"There are a number of known issues with Google Shared drives.  
File types
Some file types cannot be stored in Shared drives, such as Google Maps and existing documents with attached Apps Scripts.
Move folders
You cannot move a folder from My Drive to a Shared drive. You must move the files, though you can move multiple files at one time. See Migrate Files to Google Shared drives for detailed instructions.

Document Management & Collaboration,Migrate Files to Google Shared drives,"Uploading files
When using Google Shared drives, you can upload files and folders to a Shared drive in the same way that you upload files to your Google My Drive.  See instructions at Upload Files and Folders to Google Drive.  
Migrating files
You can also move files from your personal Google Drive, also known as My Drive, to a Shared drive.  Please note the following when moving files:
You cannot move a folder from My Drive to a Shared drive.  You must move the files, though you can move multiple files at one time.
Because you cannot move a folder, but must recreate a folder in Shared drives, folder permissions are not moved.  If you have given other users access to a folder on your My Drive, be sure to grant those permissions again in Shared drives.
You can move files owned by someone else, as long as the owner of the file in MyDrive is also a contributor, content manager or manager of the Shared Drive you are moving the item into or where the owner's account is disabled.Moving files to the Shared drives changes ownership from the individual to the team.File permissions and links do not change.  People who are not Shared drives members can still access the file with previously granted permission.
Best practices
When migrating files to a Shared drive from your personal Google Drive, do not drag and drop the files from one drive to another.  Follow the steps below to move the files.
Access your Google Drive and locate the files you want to move.Select the file or files by clicking on a single file or holding the Shift key while clicking all of the files you want to move.Right-click the mouse, or Ctrl-click if you are using a single-button mouse.Click Move to....In the drop down list, you will see a list of folders on your My Drive.

Document Management & Collaboration,How to Give Outside Users Access to Upload Files to Medicine Box Using File Request (formerly Upload Embed Widget),"If you're an Owner or Co-owner of a folder, File Request enables you to create a ""File Request"" link and either

get that link to share with people, or
embed the widget in your website, blog, or social networking service.

Both features enable you to enhance the ease and efficiency of collaboration, while maintaining security standards and avoiding email's file-size restrictions. And both features allow collaborators to directly upload content to your project folder without needing to log into Box.
Anyone, including people who do not have a SUNet ID, can upload files this way, as long as they have the link. Their computer does not have to be encrypted, but it is upload only.  They are ""blindly"" (they cannot see the folder name or contents) able to upload files to the specified folder.  This feature is approved for uploading PHI, provided that the File Request is created for a folder which is marked as ""Safe for PHI&PII"".
Creating a File Request Link
You can create a Box upload widget, and then share its link.
To create and configure a File Request Link:

In your Box account window, right-mouse click on the folder you want to share and select File Request. Box displays the File Request window.
Under Customize Options, check the options you want to enable.
To see what the widget looks like, click Preview.
After configuring the widget, under File Request Link click Copy. You can now share this link with other people.

Customization Options

Specify title enables you to add a displayed title to the widget.
Add instructions enables you to provide and display instructions on the widget for collaborators.
Allow users to add description displays a field on the widget where collaborators can add comments.
Require users to provide email displays a field on the widget where collaborators are required to provide their email addresses.

(Optional) For web authors: Embedding the Upload Embed Widget
After customizing the widget, you can embed it in a site that supports embedded HTML iframe code.
To embed the upload widget in your site:

In the File Request window, under Upload Embed Widget, click Copy.
Paste this HTML code into your site's code.

Note
The file request link and embedded upload widget do not allow people to send folders.
Known Limitations

You cannot modify the Upload Embed Widget code generated by the Web app.
Box does not support drag-and-drop in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Email notifications no longer display the uploader's name in the body of the email. To see who uploaded content, navigate to the folder for which the Upload Embed Widget was created.
Upload widgets are not optimized for mobile devices.

Always provide the least amount of access necessary while still allowing collaborators to work efficiently.
For files containing High Risk (non-PHI) Data, see our recommended sharing option.
How to share a file


Right-click on the name of the Google file. Click Share.


On the window that appears, enter the email address(es) of the person or people to whom you want to grant access. Avoid using mailing lists when possible.
Depending upon the Shared drives Settings, you might get a window that is titled “Share” or a window that is titled “Upgrade member’s access”. Both windows provide the same features to share files.


In the drop-down list, select the appropriate level of permissions for the users you will invite to collaborate: Edit, Comment, or View.


You can choose to send a message when you have completed the sharing process.


To send an email to the person or people to whom you have granted access, click Send.
If you do not want to send an email to the person to whom you have granted access, select Skip sending notification. Then click Add.



Who has access
The Who has Access window is available from the “Share” or “Upgrade members access to” window. In this window, you can designate more permissions or restrictions for those you’ve invited to the document. This is a recommended step for sharing High Risk (non-PHI) Data.


Link sharing

Turn link sharing on and off

When sharing Moderate or High Risk (non-PHI) Data, we recommend turning link sharing to ""off"" so the person you are granting access to is not able to share the document with anyone else. 


Set the access available to people with the link, such as edit, view or comment
Get a link to send to people you want to have access to the document


Member access - Members that are listed under the Shared drive icon are granted permissions through the Shared drives Share settings. You can upgrade an individual user’s access to a file.
Additional users’ access - People who have been given access to the file, but are not members of the Shared drives, are listed at the bottom of the Who has access window. You can change their access permissions or remove them from access.
Restrict user actions - You can restrict the download, print and copy actions on this file for commenters and viewers by clicking the More icon. 

In the case of a Shared drive with less restrictive file-sharing settings, set file access permissions to allow collaborators to access the file, but still restrict the file as much as possible. When setting permissions using the Who has access window, consider the following:

Restrict download, print and copy actions
Limit collaboration options to just Comment
Limit editing options to just View
Limit how the file can be found externally
Choose whether or not external access is allowed
Ensure Shared drives permissions do not interfere with the intent of your file permissions

Restricted Shared drives Settings
Link sharing options on the Who has access window are will be limited for a Shared drive that has very restricted file-sharing settings. Depending upon the Shared drives settings, you might not be able to share the file outside of the organization or with people who are not designated as members of the Shared drives. Restrictions are noted in the Who has Access window.
To learn more about file-sharing settings for Shared drives and how to change them, visit Set Share Options for Shared drives."
Document Management & Collaboration,Set Share Options for Shared drives,"After creating a Shared drive, determine and set your share options by following the steps below.

The Lagunita theme is designed for members of the Stanford community at large. Official departments and administrative units can request the Stanford Cardinal theme by submitting a Help request. 
Note: Do not move, delete, or modify themes directly, because that breaks the upgrade process. The easiest and safest way to add functionality to a theme is to use a ""child"" theme. A WordPress child theme inherits the functionality of another theme, but allows you to modify it. Read more about child themes and how to create them at WordPress.org.
Akismet plugin
Akismet is an anti-spam service for websites that have comments enabled. The Akismet plugin checks for spam in the comments on your website, filters comments that look like spam, and lets you review the comments marked as spam. The plugin requires an Akismet.com API key. 
Hello Dolly plugin
The Hello Dolly plugin displays lyrics from the song ""Hello, Dolly"" in the WordPress Admin panel. This is a default plugin that most users leave inactivated. You can inactivate the plugin or delete it if you do not want it.
HTTP Authentication plugin
The HTTP Authentication plugin is a third-party plugin that Stanford uses to provide integration with WebAuth, allowing you and your users to log in to your WordPress site using your SUNetID and password. If you select WebAuth protection at installation, this plugin is activated for you.
Reverse-Proxy plugin
The Reverse-Proxy plugin is only needed by sites that are using a Web Virtual Host (also known as a vanity URL) that was set up a long time ago as a reverse proxy. Most new vanity URLs are not set up in this way, therefore new installations do not need this plugin, and it is inactive by default.
Using additional themes and plugins
There are thousands of free or low-cost non-Stanford themes and plugins available to add design or functionality to your WordPress site. You can browse themes and plugins on WordPress.org.  As with any software, the quality of themes and plugins varies. For theme and plugin recommendations from other WordPress users on campus, email the WordPress users mailing list. The Stanford University WordPress Community of Practice also maintains a list of plugins widely used at Stanford. University IT can not help you choose or maintain themes or plugins that you install on your own.
Installing themes and plugins through WordPress
Most, but not all, themes and plugins work on the Stanford web servers and installation can be done through WordPress.
Installing themes and plugins manually
Most plugins and themes can be installed through WordPress, but some, like the ones not on the WordPress Plugins Directory, need to be installed manually. If the plugin you are trying to install is one of these, follow the directions below for a manual install.
The WordPress software is installed on Stanford's distributed file system, called the Andrew File System (AFS). Follow these steps to install your own themes and plugins:
Download the themes or plugins to your computer.Unzip (expand) the themes or plugins on your computer.Connect to AFS using the secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) application or OpenAFS.
SFTP:  University IT provides two SFTP software programs free of charge: Fetch for Macintosh and SecureFX for Windows. Instructions on how to install the software and connect to shared servers are included on the Essential Stanford Software pages.
For Macintosh:
Download Fetch for MacintoshInstallation instructions for Fetch
For Windows:
Download SecureFX for WindowsInstallation instructions for SecureFX

OpenAFS: University IT packages OpenAFS client software for both Mac OS X and Windows. This software provides an alternative to SFTP clients like Fetch and SecureFX for people who frequently access files in AFS space. Follow the instructions on the OpenAFS pages to install and connect to (mount) your group or department directory.
Upload the plugins and themes to the location in AFS where WordPress is installed.Activate the themes or plugins using the WordPress Admin panel.

Websites,Qualtrics Accessibility and Usability,"Qualtrics has several options available to make your surveys more accessible. Follow the tips below to make your next Qualtrics survey optimized for the broadest audience possible.
Check survey accessibility
Qualtrics offers survey creators the option of running accessibility checks on surveys. If potential problems are found within the survey, the survey creator will be notified and given suggestions for how they can change the questions to make them more accessible.
Accessible and non-accessible question types
Did you know that multiple choice questions are accessible, while ""pick, group, and rank"" questions are not? Qualtrics gives examples of accessible and non-accessible question types so you know how to better serve survey responders. 
Auto-number questions
Set up your Qualtrics account to automatically number every question, which can help users with screen readers track their progress. 
Change button text
To better serve an international community, Qualtrics by default labels the button to continue to the next screen as "">>,"" and the button to go back as ""<<."" But by changing the button text to ""back"" and ""next,"" you can make your survey more accessible to users with screen readers.   
Change the default survey title
In Qualtrics, you are asked to name your survey when you first create it, and there is also the option to change your survey page title — or what users will see as the title on an open tab in a browser.
Qualtrics' default page title for all surveys is ""Online Survey Software | Qualtrics Survey Solutions,"" but Qualtrics recommends changing page titles to something more specific because page titles are usually the first thing that screen readers read. Changing this to something more specific to your survey will help users with screen readers better track content if they have multiple tabs open, especially if they have multiple Qualtrics surveys open.
To change the default survey title, click Survey Options. Find the text field that says Survey Title and change it to something that adequately and briefly describes the content of your survey. Click Save.

A: There is a policy that does not permit including a link to a commercial website on a Stanford website. Often these links produce an “affiliates” fee, which would be considered to be unrelated business income. Even if there is no affiliates fee, these links would be considered to be an endorsement of a commercial enterprise, which is contrary to Stanford’s policy.

Websites,How to Display Your StanfordWho Profile Photo,"Faculty and staff members can use their Stanford ID card photo or their Stanford Profiles photo in StanfordWho.
If you're a faculty or staff member, set your Stanford ID card image visibility setting in StandfordYou to control which image displays in StanfordWho. ""Private"" is the default Stanford ID card image visibility setting for staff and faculty members. Therefore, no photo will appear in StanfordWho unless you’ve changed the image visibility setting or uploaded a photo in Stanford Profiles.​ 
Here are instructions for how to control which photo displays in StanfordWho:
To display your Stanford ID card photo:

Log into StanfordYou and set your ID Card image visibility setting to ""Public"" or ""Stanford.""
Note: You can update your ID card image online. You’re not required to have a new ID card printed when you update the photo. But if you do, the cost to print a replacement card is $25.

To display your Stanford Profiles photo:

Log into StanfordYou and ensure your Stanford ID Card image visibility setting is set to ""Private.""
Log into  Stanford Profiles and click ""Edit My Profile"" in the upper right side of the page to set your image visibility setting to ""Stanford"" or ""Public.""

To display no photo:

Log into StanfordYou and ensure your ID card setting is ""Private.""
Note: If you have a photo uploaded in Stanford Profiles, it will display in StanfordWho with these settings.


Each night, University IT will send images with a visibility setting of Stanford or Public to StanfordWho. Depending upon the image visibility settings, these images will then display in the Stanford and/or Public view(s) of the StanfordWho directory.
To keep the systems aligned, we strongly encourage you to upload the same photo you’ve uploaded in Stanford Profiles to your Stanford ID card. Just keep in mind any photo you submit for your ID card must meet certain requirements, which are listed on the ID card photo submission webpage.  If you would like to upload an image to or update your Stanford Profile, simply navigate to profiles.stanford.edu, and click on the ""Edit My Profile"" option in the upper right side of the page."

Public and restricted views
The default mode of StanfordWho is ""public"" — this is the view that the general public can see, and includes only those people who have chosen to make their listing public.
Members of the Stanford community, including affiliated organizations such as Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children's Health, can log in to the restricted view. This view includes more people, and individual listings often include more information than the public view.
To search the Stanford- and Affiliates-only directory, you must have an active SUNet ID and academic or administrative privileges. Most people who are listed in the directory can log in to the Stanford view, with some exceptions (e.g., incoming students not yet on campus).
You can access the Stanford-only view directly.
Visibility and privacy settings
Each person's listing in the Stanford directory is governed by visibility and privacy settings they control, either via Axess (for students) or via StanfordYou (for staff and faculty).
Note for Students: See the Directory Information page for a list of items regarded as directory information according to the Office of the University Registrar.
Faculty and staff can choose whether to be listed in public view, the Stanford-only view, or unlisted (private). Students can be in the public view or unlisted.
If your directory preference is:
public: your listing will appear in both the public view of the directory and the Stanford-only view. Anyone can find you—but only by searching for the specific information you have made available to the directory.Stanford: your listing will not appear in the public view of the directory, no matter what kind of search is performed. In the Stanford view, your listing will appear with an indicator to show that you are not listed in the public directory. This helps the searcher see who has been added to the results list by searching the Stanford-only directory, and serves as a reminder to not disclose your information outside the Stanford community.private: your listing will not appear in either the public or the Stanford- and Affiliates only view. No matter what kind of search is performed, your information will not be included in any results set. Note that this usually includes the printed annual directory, unless your organization chooses to override settings through Organization Manager."

Websites,Class Email List,"Class email lists enable you to send announcements easily to everyone associated with your class. When you register for Email Announcement Lists, University IT creates an e-mail distribution list of all your students (along with three other email lists described below). This student list is kept up-to-date automatically, using current enrollment data from the Registrar, so you won’t have to subscribe or unsubscribe students as they add or drop the class. Please note that students’ ""@stanford.edu"" email addresses are the ones used for University IT class email lists. Students who use another account as a primary email address will need to forward the @stanford.edu address to the preferred address using StanfordYou.

Websites,Class Disk Space,"University IT Course Support includes 500MB of space for you to store and share syllabi, web files, course outlines, problem sets, notes, essays, etc. Your class space is located in the University’s AFS distributed file system. Along with serving as a data storage, file sharing, and Web hosting environment, AFS enables cooperating hosts (clients and servers) to efficiently share file system resources across both local area and wide are networks. All of the materials you store in AFS are backed up regularly by University IT. Your space is located and named according to a straightforward labeling system and file structure, making it easy to find and work with. (Example: /afs/ir/class/<name of your class here>.)
If the standard 500MB isn’t adequate for your class directory, you can request more when you register or via email to courses@stanford.edu. You can also request that University IT allocate additional space to your students’ personal directories to accommodate assignments or other work they may need to share with you or their classmates. Just look for the additional space options on the Registration/Renewal Form or send an email request to courses@stanford.edu.
What happens to my stored data when the course is over?
If you happen to be teaching the same course the subsequent quarter and want your materials to stay in place, then you’ll need to renew the course registration using the same form you used to register the course initially. If you are not teaching the class in the subsequent quarter, you don’t need to do a thing: the contents of the class directory are archived automatically at the end of the term.
AFS Class Archive Details

Background
AFS is a distributed file system based on client/server architecture. AFS joins together multiple server machine file systems. An AFS cell is grouping of client/server machines which is administered by a domain. Stanford’s administrative domain is named “ir.stanford.edu” — which at Stanford can be abbreviated to just “ir.” Directories and files relevant to the classes you’re teaching or have taught in the past are stored under /afs/ir/class/archive. You can learn more about AFS and how it’s organized by visiting AFS at Stanford.
AFS Storage
Your AFS storage space is divided into volumes, each of which contains a set of related directories and file. People access these volumes via “mount points”: special file elements that indicate which volumes should be associated with which directories. Volumes can be placed anywhere in AFS by using a mount point, and will then appear as a directory. For example, the files for the class EE118 taught in 2003 exist in a volume named class.ee118.1034. To access these files through AFS, that volume is mounted. Typically a mount point would created at /afs/ir/class/ee182. Under that directory will be the contents of the class.ee182.1032 volume.
How It Works
In AFS, Stanford's class directories can be found under:
/afs/ir/class/archive/
and are further subdivided, by volume, as follows:
subject/subjectnumber/subjectnumber.qtr
For example, class materials for Computer Science 147b, which is offered during autumn quarter of 2004-2005, can be accessed by the following mount point:
/afs/ir/class/archive/cs/cs147b/cs147b.1052
(The number 1052 is the PeopleSoft code for autumn 2004-2005.) In addition to the above mount point, an additional mount point for the currently active quarter is created under /afs/ir/class. In this case, there would be an additional mount point at /afs/ir/class/cs147b. These are just two mount points, two names, for the same volume and the same files; the contents of the directories:
/afs/ir/class/archive/cs/cs147b/cs147b.1052
and
/afs/ir/class/cs147b
would be absolutely identical, changes made in one location would be automatically reflected in the other location.
How Materials are Retained Year After Year
When a new quarter begins, at your request, a class system administrator will create a new volume. That volume can be a clone of the old volume or an empty volume. Using the example above, where the PeopleSoft code for winter is 1054, this material would then be found under /afs/ir/class/archive/cs/cs147b/cs147b.1054. The mount point for /afs/ir/class/cs147b is moved to point to the new volume. No class materials are deleted or moved. Only the mount points are moved. “Archiving,” then, is really just a process of moving mount points and is typically done quarterly. In addition to the above process, a nightly backup is performed on all volumes in AFS. For more information on AFS, please see AFS at Stanford."
Websites,Why can't links on Stanford Sites open in a new tab or window?,"Due to accessibility and usability concerns, Stanford Sites websites are configured so that links will not open in a new browser window (or tab.) 
When a link opens in a new window while a user is on a smartphone or a tablet, they can no longer use the back button to navigate. This is an issue on desktops as well. We call this ""breaking the back button."" 
Opening new windows or tabs also causes issues with screen readers as the announcement that the browser is opening in a new window is easily missed by the user.
Instead, users can control this behavior themselves by using cmd-click(MacOS) or ctrl-click(Windows) to open new tabs, if desired.

Websites,Retire Your WordPress Site,"UIT is modernizing content management systems and moving to the cloud. As a result, WordPress on AFS will not be available for new sites as of May 1, 2021. WordPress on Stanford Domains is the recommended solution for individuals and groups interested in creating personal or collaborative sites using WordPress. For official department websites or those with more complex needs, Stanford Sites is the primary content management system. Additional information can be found on the WCMS WordPress Hosting project page.
If you no longer need your site and would like to delete it, you may be tempted to just remove the files from AFS. That frees up space from your AFS directory, but it does not delete the database that WordPress was using to store its content, nor does it clear the record from the installer (if you installed it using the WordPress installer).
The best way to delete your site is to submit a Help Request.
In your request, mention the location of your site (your group or department name, and the subdirectory where you installed WordPress, e.g., /group/group-name/cgi-bin/blog). University IT will then delete the record from the installer, and free up the database. If you want to keep a backup of your WordPress site, make sure to copy it before you contact University IT to have it deleted, or ask University IT to provide you with a copy.
Make a final backup
To keep a backup of your WordPress site before you have it deleted, you need two things:
a copy of the WordPress filesa recent backup of the database
You can find both of these in AFS (the file system where they are stored). The WordPress files are in the directory where WordPress was originally installed. Databases are backed up daily in the early morning and stored in a special directory called db_private at the root of your group or department AFS space. 
For example, for a WordPress site installed for the department of History in a subdirectory called blog:
The files are found in /afs/ir/dept/history/cgi-bin/blogThe database backups are found in /afs/ir/dept/history/db_private/
Database backups are named after your group or department and include the word ""wordpress"" in them to distinguish them from other database backups. In case your department or group has more than one WordPress site installed, a number is appended to the filename as well (e.g., wordpress1, wordpress2, etc.)
The filename includes sql (the extension for database backups) and a number from 0 to 3. The latest backup uses the number 0. Finally, the backup is compressed and has an extension of .gz
So, the latest backup for the department of history's first WordPress site would be called d_history_wordpress1.sql.0.gz. The latest backup for third WordPress site for the tennis group would be called g_tennis_wordpress3.sql.0.gz
To make a backup of your WordPress site's files and database use either SFTP or OpenAFS to connect to your group or departments AFS space and download the files to a safe place.
If you have any trouble identifying which database backup to use, or can't find the location of the files, make sure to ask for a backup of the site when submitting your Help request.

Additional information can be found on the WCMS WordPress Hosting project page.
Sometimes you are handed a WordPress site to manage, but don't have full access to it. There are two kinds of administrative access to a WordPress site:
Access to an administrator account on the site itself.Access to the group or department web space where the WordPress software is installed.
Each access method provides the ability to perform different tasks.
WordPress administrator: make content upgrades, upgrade WordPress software, maintain users, or manage comments
A WordPress Administrator is someone who has access to the Admin Panel within WordPress and can perform tasks from within the site itself, such as make content upgrades, upgrade WordPress software, add users or manage comments. 
The best way to obtain this type of access is from a person who's already an administrator of the website, such as the person that originally installed WordPress. They can create a new account for you or promote your existing account to one with administrative privileges.
Group or department web space administrator: install WordPress
While you might be a WordPress administrator, you might still not have administration rights to the underlying web space that hosts WordPress. This is required if you need to install more instances of WordPress, or if you need to install or upgrade plugins and themes manually (if they can't be updated through WordPress itself).

There are lots of reasons why people might want to compromise your WordPress site. They range from simple mischief (“look, I hacked into Stanford and my name is now on their web page!”), to financial reasons (“I can now use the site to send out tons of spam through Stanford’s servers and get paid for it by my clients”). Even if all of your content is public, your site is still a target and it’s your responsibility to keep it as secure as possible.
To help keep your site secure, make sure that you:
Upgrade the software regularly through the WordPress Upgrader.Don’t allow people to self-register and become admins.Use strong passwords.Use WebAuth, if possible, for logging in.Set AFS permissions correctly (AFS is the file system where your data is stored).Retire the site properly when you no longer need or use it.
Keep the code up-to-date
WordPress is a secure platform to begin with, but as time goes by hackers discover bugs they can exploit to break into your site. Therefore, it's very important to keep the software up-to-date when new versions of WordPress and its plugins are released. See Keep your WordPress site up-to-date.
New users
WordPress can allow anyone to register and create an account on the site. This is great if you want new subscribers to be able to create their own accounts, follow your blog and you have time to monitor new users. Unfortunately, this feature can be exploited by spammers who use these accounts as a foothold for trying to break into your site. If you don't have time to monitor your site and delete spammer accounts, you may want to prevent users from creating their own accounts.
Prevent users from creating new accounts on their own
In the Admin Panel, select Settings > General and verify that the Membership - Anyone can register option is unchecked.
If you are using WebAuth for authentication of new users, only Stanford users will be able to create accounts, which is much safer. However, if you still want to prevent new users from having accounts on the site, in the Admin Panel, select Settings > HTTP Authentication and uncheck Automatically create accounts?
Verify the role is correct
New accounts automatically receive a default role. You should verify that the role is the correct one. At install time, the default role new users receive is that of Subscriber, which allows them to create an account and read the blog, but nothing else.
To verify the default role visit the Admin Panel for your site, select Settings > General and verify that Subscriber is the value for New User Default Role.
Strong Passwords
If you are using local WordPress accounts for administration, make sure that you set strong passwords. If your password is weak, it’s just a matter of time before one of the automated password-guessers running around the internet find it. Stanford’s web servers are probed thousands of times a day.
For advice on choosing a strong password, see SUNet ID Passwords.
Use WebAuth for user authentication
WordPress installed through the WordPress Installer comes with a plugin, called ""HTTP Authentication"" which integrates WebAuth with WordPress, allowing you to log in using through Weblogin using your regular SUNet ID and password. It’s more secure, and there is one fewer password to remember.
When you installed WordPress, you would have been given the option for WebAuth. If you didn't select it at that time, and would like to enable it after the installation is completed, please submit a Help request.
AFS permissions / file system security
You’ll also want to make sure that the permissions for the WordPress software files installed on AFS (Stanford's distributed file system) are set up correctly. If they are not, they could allow someone else to read your database password, or they could allow someone to write malicious software or modify your files to gain access to the software application.
The correct permissions are set up at install time by the WordPress Installer. If you'd like to double-check, the easiest way to do so is through WebAFS, the Web interface to Stanford's distributed files system called AFS.
Visit https://afs.stanford.edu and under Current AFS Directory Path enter your group or department's cgi-bin directory. For example, for the history department, the correct directory would be /afs/ir/dept/history/cgi-bin. For a group called opensource, the correct directory would be /afs/ir/group/opensource/cgi-bin.

Select the directory where the blog is installed and click on Set Permissions for Folder.

A list of permissions for the folder will be shown. The correct permissions are:
-admins group: all permissionssystem:dept-admin: all permissionssystem:backup: lookup and readsystem:www-servers: lookup and readsystem:administrators: all permissionsservice.tools: lookup and readyour group or department's .cgi: all permissions except admin

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Sponsored Services,"The following services can be sponsored with Sponsorship Manager:

Account

Base account (SUNet ID)
Full account (SUNet ID and email)


Email service for a department or function

Account (SUNet ID, email)
A sponsored SUNet ID is available to anyone who is not part of the core Stanford community (students, faculty, staff) as long as this person uses computing resources in support of legitimate University work. SUNet IDs can be sponsored for contractors and consultants, temporary staff, visiting faculty, and others.
A person can have only one SUNet ID, through either sponsorship or university eligibility. It's possible (though unnecessary) to sponsor a university-eligible person's SUNet ID; simply, no charges will accrue to the sponsor's PTA until the sponsored person's university-eligible status ends. Not all services available to university-eligible SUNet IDs are available to sponsored SUNet IDs.
How to sponsor a SUNet ID account
To sponsor an account for someone, follow the steps below.Note: You must be a faculty member, manager, or have been expressly granted the privilege to sponsor.

On the Sponsorship dashboard, click Sponsor a SUNet ID > Sponsor a person.
Select the service level — either a base (no email) or full (email and services).
Enter a start and end date for the sponsorship. The maximum duration allowed is one year.
Search for the person who needs a SUNet ID.

If the person's SUNet ID or University ID is found in Sponsorship Manager, click Sponsor to activate the account.
If the person doesn't have a SUNet ID or person record, Sponsorship Manager sends an email to the person you want to sponsor asking for identifying information. Once they respond you'll be able to finalize the sponsorship.


For a new account, the sponsored individual will receive an email invitation to create a new SUNet ID at accounts.stanford.edu. The account must be created within 30 days.
The new SUNet ID is activated on the day you indicated as the sponsorship start date. No more action is required of either party.

When a full-service SUNet ID is sponsored, a monthly fee is billed to the PTA you provide;  you must have requisitions authority for the PTA in Oracle Financials. When a base service level is sponsored, no PTA is required.
The SUNet ID is used as the login ID (available to all service levels) to access systems and secure online resources to which it has been specifically allowed, at the discretion of the system owner. These may include:


login to Axess (if the owner was formerly a student)


login to any protected website to which it has been granted access


Email service for a department or function
University departments or functions can be given a special, shared email account. The account name must be 9 characters or longer, e.g., facultyaffairs@stanford.edu. To request a shared email account, please submit a request form. Once the account has been approved and created for you, sponsorship is required to activate it.
If you are the administrator for a shared email account, when you log in to Stanford Accounts and click the Email Management tile, you will see a new tile for Shared Email. There, you can set up email forwarding addresses. To set up an autoreply for a shared email, please visit Manage Autoreply."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Sponsor a Person,"A person record is a record in the Stanford system that contains personally identifiable information such as full name, date of birth, and personal email address of the person being sponsored. Several Stanford systems use the same person record, and duplicate records cause severe service interruptions such as delayed paychecks, no email access, and ineligibility for a campus ID card. A person record must be found or created before someone can be sponsored for a SUNet ID account.
A sponsor must be a faculty member, a manager, or someone who has been given authority to sponsor in Authority Manager. The sponsor and the sponsored person (sponsee) work together to retrieve an existing SUNet ID or create a new one. There are three parts to this process:
Part 1: The sponsor searches the Stanford system to make sure that a person receiving sponsorship doesn't already have a record in the system.  The sponsor can search by SUNet ID, University ID, or at a minimum last name and date of birth. If a record is found, the person can be sponsored immediately for a SUNet ID account.
Part 2: If no record is found, Sponsorship Manager issues an email invitation to the sponsee to provide additional information. When the sponsee replies to the email, the sponsor is notified and the Sponsorship Manager dashboard is updated. The sponsor can then complete the process by either sponsoring an existing SUNet ID or creating a new person record and sponsoring the account.
Part 3: When a new person record is created and sponsored, Sponsorship Manager issues an email invitation to the sponsored person and a confirmation of sponsorship email to the sponsor or their designated contact. The sponsored person follows the link in the invitation email and creates a new SUNet ID.
Part 1: Search for a person in Stanford's systems
Before sponsoring a person for a SUNet ID, you must confirm that they don't already have an active or previously active record in the Stanford system. You can search for a person record by SUNet ID/University ID or by name and date of birth.

Log in to Sponsorship Manager.   
Click Sponsor a Service and then click SUNet ID. 
On the Step 1: Sponsorship details page:

Select the service level and start and end dates.
If you are sponsoring a full-service SUNet ID, enter a current PTA for which you have requisitions authority in Oracle Financials.
If you are sponsoring this person on behalf of someone else, check the I am sponsoring on behalf of box. Enter the SUNet ID of the person you are sponsoring on behalf of.
Add Notes if you wish. 

 
Click Next to search whether the person you wish to sponsor already exists in the system and has a SUNet ID. 
To search by SUNet ID or University ID:

Enter the SUNet ID or University ID in the search box and then click the search icon.
The name associated with the ID displays. If this is the person you wish to sponsor, click Sponsor. 

 
To search by name and date of birth:

Instead of entering a SUNet or University ID, click Don't know.
Enter at least the last name and birthdate of the person you want to sponsor and then click Search. The more information you enter, the more accurate the search results will be.
Several records may be returned that are potential matches. Review the returned records carefully to determine whether one belongs to the person you want to sponsor.
If one of the returned records belongs to the person you wish to sponsor, click Sponsor.
If the search results do not find the person you wish to sponsor, go to Part 2: Create a new person record. 

 
Provide a contact email address for the person you are sponsoring and click Submit. 
Review the contract details. Check the box to agree that the service contract is entered correctly and then click Finish. 
If necessary, the sponsored person can go to accounts.stanford.edu, click the Password Management tile, then click the Forgot Password tile to reset their password.

Part 2: Create a new person record
When you are certain that the person you're sponsoring doesn't already have a person record, create a new record and sponsor their SUNet ID account.

Follow the steps in Part 1 to make sure that the person you're sponsoring doesn't already have a person record or SUNet ID. 
If you can't find a match, Sponsorship Manager will send an email to the person you want to sponsor requesting more identifying information. Enter the sponsee's non-Stanford email address and click Submit.Note: You may not provide an @stanford.edu email address for a base sponsorship, as the sponsee will not have Stanford email service. 
The sponsee receives an email with a link to a form to provide identifying information. The sponsee has 7 days to complete and submit the form. 
The sponsor is notified via email when the sponsee submits the form. 
On the Sponsorship Manager dashboard, click the Invitations tab. Click Review > Review response. 
If you find out that the invitation email is sent to incorrect address, you can cancel the invitation and start over with a new sponsorship.
On the View response and match results screen, click Create person. 
Next, review the sponsorship details and, if you wish, make changes. Then click Next. 
Review the contract details. Check the box to agree that the service contract is entered correctly and then click Finish.

Part 3: Sponsored person creates a SUNet ID
When the person being sponsored receives the invitation email, they should follow the instructions to create a new SUNet ID. If necessary, you and the person being sponsored are sent a reminder email 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the person is sponsored.
If the person being sponsored does not create a SUNet ID within 30 days, the record you created for that person is deleted. You and the person you sponsored will receive a notification email. If you want to sponsor someone after their record is deleted, repeat part 1 and part 2. Someone else may have created a record for that person in the last 30 days, so be sure to search carefully before creating a new record and sponsoring an account."

Emergency contacts
SUNet ID
Directory listing
Primary work location


Account status


Why does my functional account show as ""pending""?


The account is pending until it is sponsored. It will become active approximately four hours after it has been sponsored.
If you have not already identified a sponsor, ask a staff or faculty member to go to Sponsorship Manager and sponsor the account.


Email address


Why do some third-party web sites not work without a Stanford email address?


Many third party services assume that everyone with a SUNetID has a Stanford email address. That is not always true; many sponsored SUNetIDs do not come with Stanford email service, and some SUNetIDs keep their email address private.
If you have a Stanford email address, you can fix the problem by changing the visibility level of your email address. If you do not have a Stanford email address, you can fix the problem by providing a third-party email address. The steps to fix either problem are the same.

Log into StanfordYou.
Click Maintain your directory ad AlertSU emergency contact information.
In the SU Contact Info section, click change.
In the Email address section there are two settings to check:

Either select a Stanford email address or enter a third-party email address.
Set your Email visibility to either 'Public' or 'Stanford'.


Save your changes. Changes can take up to an hour to propagate.

Once your email address has been entered, the change will propagate the Stanford Directory service (LDAP).  The next time you log in to a third-party web site using Stanford credentials, your email address will be provided to the third-party. 
For additional help, review the How do I fix it? steps complete with screenshots.


Emergency contacts


How do I update my emergency contact?


To update your emergency contact, you must first add a new emergency contact and “promote” the new contact to be your primary. Once you add and select a new primary contact, you can then delete a former primary contact.
If you have only one emergency contact, and that person is no longer valid or appropriate as a contact for you, select someone else who can be your emergency contact and enter their information in place of your current contact. Accurate emergency contact information is vital in case of personal or campus emergencies.
To add an emergency contact:

Log into StanfordYou.
Click Maintain your external emergency contact information.

To promote an alternate contact to primary contact:

Log into StanfordYou.
Click Maintain your external emergency contact information.
Click make this my primary contact next to the name of the contact.

Next to Emergency contacts, click add new contact and enter the contact information.
Click Save.



Students can find the instructions to add emergency contact here.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Sponsorship Details,"Who can sponsor
Faculty,  managers (as defined by Human Resources), and individuals who have been expressly granted the privilege can sponsor individuals or accounts for services by using Sponsorship Manager, a web application. Anyone with a SUNet ID can view sponsorship information.
Paid services: The sponsor must have requisitions authority in Oracle Financials, and provide a PTA for billing.
The specific authority required is Approvals — Requisitions.This authority must be active — that is, the sponsor has completed all prerequisites and is able to actually approve requisitions in Oracle Financials.
Free services: The sponsor must be a faculty member, manager, or an individual who has been expressly granted the privilege to sponsor.
You can review the list of people and services you currently sponsor by logging into Sponsorship Manager and clicking the As Sponsor tab.
Who can be sponsored
Anyone with a SUNet ID can technically be sponsored for a service. The sponsorship will only be active, however, if the person is not otherwise eligible for the same service via his or her status at the University.
For example:
Student Pat is university-eligible for a full-service SUNet ID because she is an active student.Professor Jean sponsors Pat for a full-service SUNet ID. The sponsorship is not activated because Pat is university-eligible for the same service. No charges accrue.Pat graduates, and is now university-eligible only for base-level service.Jean's sponsorship kicks in, and Pat maintains full SUNet ID service. The PTA Jean provided is now charged monthly for the sponsored service.
Sponsor responsibilities
When sponsoring a person for a new SUNet ID account, you are responsible for ensuring that the person being sponsored doesn't already have an existing record and SUNet ID.As sponsor you must affirm that the individual to be sponsored will use the service or resource in support of legitimate University work (i.e., teaching, research, and administration).You are responsible for ensuring that a sponsored service is used in accordance with the University's policies. See the Administrative Guide policies related to Computing for more information.For paid services, the sponsor must provide a current University PTA, for which the sponsor has active Approvals - Requisitions authority in Oracle Financials. Service fees will be billed monthly to this PTA.You will receive notification of sponsorship status changes, unless you indicated a different sponsorship contact person.
Effective period
A sponsorship is valid for a fixed time period of up to one year, specified by the sponsor. Prior to sponsorship expiration, both the sponsor and the person who is sponsored will receive a reminder (via email) 30 days prior to expiration, and a second notice seven days before expiration. If you are a sponsor, you do not need to wait for these notices to renew a sponsorship.
Note: A person who is sponsored for a base-level account will not receive email notification, because base-level accounts do not include email service. Only the sponsor (or specified contact) will be notified.
Sponsorship on-behalf- of
Sponsorship Manager lets you sponsor a service on behalf of someone else. See the Sponsorship On-behalf-of page for more information.
Multiple sponsorships
More than one sponsor can sponsor the same service for the same person.
If the service is exclusive (e.g., account), the new sponsorship will immediately supersede the preceding one.
In the event you decide to end your sponsorship of a full-service account, you will need to notify the account owner of this change. The email service and other services associated with the account will end at midnight of the date you end your sponsorship.
View sponsorships
You can view the services you sponsor, services for which you are the sponsee, and services sponsored on your behalf on the Sponsorship dashboard. To access the reports click the tab of the report you want to view.

Rates, billing, and reimbursement
Rates
The PTA you provide will be charged the daily rate for the service level you select, up to the monthly maximum for that service level. See the Sponsored Account Rates page for daily and monthly rates.
Billing
Authorized users can view sponsorship charges on their monthly IT services billing statements via the OrderIT site.
Reimbursement
You may not use personal funds to pay for a sponsored service; it must be billed to a University funding source. This allows the University to follow legal guidelines regarding unrelated business income, tax exemption, etc. However, a sponsoring department may choose to require personal reimbursement from a person they sponsor.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Sponsorship Details,"Who can sponsor
Faculty,  managers (as defined by Human Resources), and individuals who have been expressly granted the privilege can sponsor individuals or accounts for services by using Sponsorship Manager, a web application. Anyone with a SUNet ID can view sponsorship information.
Paid services: The sponsor must have requisitions authority in Oracle Financials, and provide a PTA for billing.
The specific authority required is Approvals — Requisitions.This authority must be active — that is, the sponsor has completed all prerequisites and is able to actually approve requisitions in Oracle Financials.
Free services: The sponsor must be a faculty member, manager, or an individual who has been expressly granted the privilege to sponsor.
You can review the list of people and services you currently sponsor by logging into Sponsorship Manager and clicking the As Sponsor tab.
Who can be sponsored
Anyone with a SUNet ID can technically be sponsored for a service. The sponsorship will only be active, however, if the person is not otherwise eligible for the same service via his or her status at the University.
For example:
Student Pat is university-eligible for a full-service SUNet ID because she is an active student.Professor Jean sponsors Pat for a full-service SUNet ID. The sponsorship is not activated because Pat is university-eligible for the same service. No charges accrue.Pat graduates, and is now university-eligible only for base-level service.Jean's sponsorship kicks in, and Pat maintains full SUNet ID service. The PTA Jean provided is now charged monthly for the sponsored service.
Sponsor responsibilities
When sponsoring a person for a new SUNet ID account, you are responsible for ensuring that the person being sponsored doesn't already have an existing record and SUNet ID.As sponsor you must affirm that the individual to be sponsored will use the service or resource in support of legitimate University work (i.e., teaching, research, and administration).You are responsible for ensuring that a sponsored service is used in accordance with the University's policies. See the Administrative Guide policies related to Computing for more information.For paid services, the sponsor must provide a current University PTA, for which the sponsor has active Approvals - Requisitions authority in Oracle Financials. Service fees will be billed monthly to this PTA.You will receive notification of sponsorship status changes, unless you indicated a different sponsorship contact person.
Effective period
A sponsorship is valid for a fixed time period of up to one year, specified by the sponsor. Prior to sponsorship expiration, both the sponsor and the person who is sponsored will receive a reminder (via email) 30 days prior to expiration, and a second notice seven days before expiration. If you are a sponsor, you do not need to wait for these notices to renew a sponsorship.
Note: A person who is sponsored for a base-level account will not receive email notification, because base-level accounts do not include email service. Only the sponsor (or specified contact) will be notified.
Sponsorship on-behalf- of
Sponsorship Manager lets you sponsor a service on behalf of someone else. See the Sponsorship On-behalf-of page for more information.
Multiple sponsorships
More than one sponsor can sponsor the same service for the same person.
If the service is exclusive (e.g., account), the new sponsorship will immediately supersede the preceding one.
In the event you decide to end your sponsorship of a full-service account, you will need to notify the account owner of this change. The email service and other services associated with the account will end at midnight of the date you end your sponsorship.
View sponsorships
You can view the services you sponsor, services for which you are the sponsee, and services sponsored on your behalf on the Sponsorship dashboard. To access the reports click the tab of the report you want to view.

Rates, billing, and reimbursement
Rates
The PTA you provide will be charged the daily rate for the service level you select, up to the monthly maximum for that service level. See the Sponsored Account Rates page for daily and monthly rates.
Billing
Authorized users can view sponsorship charges on their monthly IT services billing statements via the OrderIT site.
Reimbursement
You may not use personal funds to pay for a sponsored service; it must be billed to a University funding source. This allows the University to follow legal guidelines regarding unrelated business income, tax exemption, etc. However, a sponsoring department may choose to require personal reimbursement from a person they sponsor. If it is appropriate for a sponsored individual to pay for their own service, they can reimburse the university for the amount billed. See How To: Process and Deposit Department Receipts."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Update Sponsee Name and Birthdate,"The Middleware and Integration Services (MaIS) team in University IT (UIT) has created a new option to allow sponsors to change the name and birthdate of his/her sponsee, only if the sponsee’s primary affiliation with the university is sponsorship.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship","Why can't I specify an award, project, or task in Authority Manager?","Awards, projects, and tasks are owned by leaf-node organizations in the hierarchy. When you scope an authority assignment to an organization that has children, you cannot limit it more precisely than ""all projects/awards,"" which includes all current and future projects/awards for the organization and its children. If you scope the assignment to a leaf-node organization, you choose between ""all projects/awards"" or limiting it more precisely to one or more awards, projects, or tasks."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",What's New in Authority Manager,"We're adding a few new features and a refreshed user interface in the Authority Manager application.
Starting June 21, 2021, you’ll see a refreshed interface and new features in Authority Manager. While there are a number of enhancements, the core functions of viewing, granting, and revoking authority will still look and feel familiar.
More intuitive interface
Upon launching the application, you will find a redesigned homepage, similar to the one shown below. You will be able to use the panels in the center to access the features previously accessed via the “Manage Authority'' section, along with several convenient new features. All of the features that can be accessed from the panels can also be accessed from the left menu icons anywhere in the application.
From the top Help menu in the upper right, you can quickly navigate to instructions or submit a Help request.

View the authority you have
To find your authority in the new interface, simply click the ""My Authority"" panel. You’ll see a page that resembles the current legacy landing page, with newly added filtering and viewing options to help you find what you need quickly. You can view your authority in the “Current Authority'' tab. Navigate to other tabs to find recently revoked authority, proxy settings, and requests that may be waiting for your approval. You’ll also be able to click “Export to Excel'' to export the data into a spreadsheet.

View authority for a person or organization
Just as before, anyone with access to Authority Manager can look up and view somebody else's authority. To view a person’s authority in the new interface, click the Search for a Person/Org/Request panel or icon. Enter the name or SUNet ID of the person whose authority you want to view and click Search.
Similarly, to find the authority of an organization, enter the organization name or 4-character org code. In the organization hierarchy, click the organization to display its authority.

Copy Authority
If you have access to grant authority, you can copy current, revoked, or expired privileges from one person to another. To assist with copying privileges, revoked and expired authority profiles for employees who have left Stanford or moved into new roles remain visible in the system for 360 days.
The ability to copy privileges from one user to another makes onboarding more efficient as you no longer have to start from scratch when creating an authority record. When someone leaves your organization you'll be able to copy the privileges they had, even if the privileges were recently revoked or expired.
To get started, click the Search for Person/Org/Request panel or the magnifying icon from the far left menu to find the person whose privileges you want to copy from. You’ll be able to copy multiple privileges at once or copy one privilege at a time.

Request actions when you don’t have authority
When you want to copy, edit, or revoke privileges but don’t have the necessary grantable authority, you can submit a request and the system will route it to the lowest level grantor for approval. To get started, click the ""Request Authority"" panel or the ""Request Authority"" icon.
You’ll be able to view and manage the requests you’ve initiated by clicking the ""My Requests"" panel or ""My Requests"" icon. You will be able to edit your requests by assigning a new approver or canceling a request.

We’ll continue to publish updated instructional materials as they become available. Visit the Authority Manager Enhancement Project webpage for more information."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Why are some organization names or assignment rows in italics in Authority Manager?,"Inactive organization names are shown in italics. Inactive organizations continue to be accessible in Authority Manager, because they may have outstanding accounting or reporting needs that require authority.
Privileges with ""grant-only"" status are shown in italics. The person who has a grant-only privilege is not authorized to actually use the privilege in any business system, but only to grant the privileges to others, so the privilege is effectively inactive.
For example, if a person has a ""grant-only"" approvals privilege, they are not actually authorized to approve transactions, and will not be selected as an approver in the workflow. They can, however, designate other people as approvers by granting the approvals privilege to them."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",What Is Authority Manager?,"Authority Manager is a Stanford-developed web application that allows you to view and grant authority across the many administrative applications on campus. It is designed to allow the right person to grant authority to others in a distributed environment. For each administrative system, an individual may have access to view, enter, or approve privileged information. This access is determined by their authority. Authority Manager is the place to see what authority any person has, or to grant them additional authority.
Authority is granted based on three main criteria: business function, organization, and a specific privilege.

business functionA set of privileges that represent a defined University business activity.Examples: Admissions, Financial Aid, Payroll, Time/Leave.organizationAny department or group in the Official University Org Hierarchy. All privileges are granted in the context of an organization.privilegeA specific task or set of tasks that can be granted to an individual. Privileges are self-contained — for example, the ""administer leave"" privilege covers all the data and tasks required to do that job, in all affected business systems.limitPrivileges of different types can be limited by projects, awards, dollar amounts, populations, careers, and so on, to tailor the authority to the specific individual.

Some important points to remember are:
You can grant only the authority you've been given as grantable, up to the limits and conditions set for you.Having authority doesn't necessarily mean you can access the related administrative systems — your authority must be active. Inactive authority may be:
pending prerequisites (such as training you must complete), orgrant-only (such as a task you manage but don't do yourself).
Your pre-selected views show you your authority, your authority-granting proxies, and org views for the top-level organization(s) where you hold grantable authority.You can look at a view for any person or organization in the university using the tools on the Authority Manager home page.
Oracle Financials users
Oracle Financials allows both vacation delegation (selecting someone to act on your behalf for a specified period of time) and the ability to give someone access to your Worklist (typically, to allow colleagues with similar authority to act for each other at any time, or for emergency backup) as explained on the FinGate website."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship","When I assign authority in Authority Manager, what happens in Oracle Financials, PeopleSoft, and other business systems?","When you make any authority change in Authority Manager, an event is posted to a queue. Consumers of authority information check the queue periodically. If a new event is of interest to the consumer system, it will collect the authority document referenced by the event, and update the authority in their system to match it.
Example: Jane Doe is given financial approvals authority for a new project. Authority Manager posts an event to the queue, and updates Jane's authority document. All consumer systems can see the event in the queue, but this particular event is of interest only to Oracle Financials, which collects Jane's authority document and updates her Oracle authority.
Depending on the consumer system, changes take effect in near real-time (ranging from a few minutes to an hour) to next business day."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Why can't I edit or revoke an assignment in Authority Manager?,"Generally speaking, you can edit or revoke any assignment that you could also grant. Even if you were the original grantor of an assignment, if you cannot now grant the same privilege, for the same organization (or its parent), with the same (or more) limits and conditions, you will not be able to edit or revoke that assignment."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship","Why is the ""can grant "" choice sometimes unavailable when I assign authority in Authority Manager?","If you grant a financial privilege that's limited to a selected principal owner, the ""can grant"" choice will not be available. Selecting a principal owner means you're granting authority for all current and future projects and tasks owned by that principal owner. Only people who have ""all projects & tasks"" authority can extend authority limited to a principal owner."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Who can be granted authority in Authority Manager? Where do sponsored SUNet IDs fit in?,"The Stanford academic and administrative communities define the group of people who can:
log into Authority Manager, andhave active authority
The communities include:
all regular and visiting facultyall regular staffcasual/temporary staffinstructional staffdepartment-sponsored ids (contractors, consultants, temporary help, etc.)all current students
If a person's status changes so that they are no longer a member of these communities (they leave Stanford; their SUNet ID sponsorship expires; etc.), their authority will be automatically revoked."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",What happens in Authority Manager when someone leaves the University?,"When their PeopleSoft HR status changes, the authority registry is notified, and their authority is automatically revoked. The affected business systems are notified in turn, and the person's access to those systems is closed. The person(s) who granted the now-revoked authority will be notified by email. (If the original grantor is no longer available, the notification will be sent to the Help Desk to determine whether any further action is required.)
When someone is laid off, their authority is not not always automatically revoked. We recommend that authority be manually revoked."

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship","If someone has an authority limit with two projects and I only have one of them, can I restore or revoke that authority assignment limit in Authority Manager?","Currently, this is not possible. You must have grantable authority that matches completely the limits on the other person's authority assignment. You cannot revoke or restore the authority assignment if you do not match. If it was revoked by someone else you can make a new authority grant for the one you have, but not for the other. If the authority needs to be revoked you will need to request someone with sufficient grantable authority to do it."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How do prerequisites affect my authority in Authority Manager?,"Some privileges require that you complete specific training, sign a confidentiality agreement, or meet some other condition before you can actually use the privilege. Authority Manager holds the privilege in a ""pending"" state until it is notified that the prerequisite has been completed. Once you've completed a given prerequisite, any other privilege that has the same prerequisite can be activated as soon as it's granted.
When you are assigned a privilege that has unmet prerequisites, you'll be informed by email which prerequisite(s) you need to complete, and your Person view will show a ""pending prerequisites"" status for that privilege. Click the icon to see the status of the specific prerequisite(s).

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How can I find an inactive organization when it's no longer listed in the hierarchy in Authority Manager?,"To find an inactive organization in Authority Manager, it helps to know its four-character org code (also called Admin ID). Use the Find an Organization tool, or the search box in the Grant wizard to search for the organization by its name, or its 4-character code.
Inactive organizations that have existing authority assignments will appear in Person and Business Function views, in italics."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Can anyone see the authority I have in Authority Manager?,"Anyone in the Stanford academic and administrative communities (i.e. anyone who is eligible to receive authority) can access Authority Manager and view authority for any person or organization. The authority itself is not considered private information, though it is restricted to the Stanford community.
To view the authority for a person:
In the Manage Authority section, click Find a Person.Enter the name or SUNet ID of the person whose authority you want to view and click Search.
To view the authority of an organization:
In the Manage Authority section, click Find an Organization.Enter the organization name or 4-character org code.In the drop-down list, click the org code/name of the organization whose authority you want to view.In the organization hierarchy, click the organization name to display its authority."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Authority Manager Terminology,"Authority Manager lets you view, grant, and revoke systems authority to persons whose job requires them to access Stanford business systems. You grant a privilege to an eligible person and set scope, limits, and conditions on the privilege. The result is recorded as an assignment. Some privileges have prerequisites (such as training) that the recipient must complete before the assignment can take effect.
Privileges are grouped into business functions, which roughly represent a defined business activity. Business functions are grouped into authority subsystems to help differentiate similar functions.
ASSIGNMENT
Each time a grantor goes through the Grant Authority wizard, it results in one new row in the recipient's Person view. Each row represents one assignment. An assignment consists of:
a grantora recipienta business functionan organizationa privilegenone, one, or several limits, depending on how the privilege has been definedan expiration conditiona ""grantable"" condition (which determines whether the recipient can, in turn, grant this authority)a start-date (if specified)
If the grantor selects more than one population, project, task, etc., all the other elements of the assignment apply equally to each of the selections.
For example, if the grantor selects two projects in the same assignment, the same spending limit will apply to both projects. If the projects require different spending limits, they must be granted separately with different spending limits.AUTHORITY-GRANTING PROXY
A person you designate in Authority Manager to grant authority on your behalf. That person can act as you in Authority Manager to grant any authority that you yourself can grant, but cannot act as you in any Stanford business systems.
AUTHORITY SUBSYSTEM
Authority subsystems are loosely equivalent to University business offices and the business systems that support them.
Financial Systems GL — Oracle FinancialsHuman Resources — PeopleSoft HR, WorkflowStudent Systems and Data — PeopleSoft Student Admin
In Authority Manager, lists of business functions are grouped by authority subsystem to help distinguish between similar functions in different business areas, e.g., financial approvals and HR approvals.
BUSINESS FUNCTION
A set of privileges that represents a defined University business activity.
Examples: Purchasing, Admissions, Payroll
Financial Systems GL = authority subsystem :. Approvals, Purchasing = business functionsHuman Resources = authority subsystem; Payroll :. Time and Leave = business functionsStudent Systems and Data = authority subsystem :. Admissions, Financial Aid = business functions
CONDITION
An individual must meet specified conditions to have systems authority. They must be a current member of the Stanford community (staff, faculty, student), and must have met any prerequisites attached to the privilege. A manager can set a future start date if they wish to activate the authority later. A manager can also set an expiration date when the authority will be automatically revoked (or renewed by the manager).
ELIGIBLE PERSON
Authority can be granted to anyone in the Stanford administrative or academic communities. These include:
all regular facultyall regular staffcasual/temporary staffinstructional staffdepartment-sponsored IDs (contractors, consultants, temporary help, etc.)in some cases current students
​​If a person has authority, and their status changes so that they are no longer a member of these communities, their authority will be automatically revoked. Only members of these communities can log into Authority Manager to view or grant authority.​
​GRANT
The act of assigning authority that you have been authorized to extend to others. You can be authorized in two ways:
Someone has granted you authority with the ""can extend"" condition.Someone has made you their authority-granting proxy, and they have authority with the ""can extend"" condition.
LIMIT
Some privileges apply only within the projects, populations, dollar amounts, etc. specified by the grantor — these are collectively referred to as ""limits."" Some privileges are, by their nature, unlimited.
If a privilege has limits defined, they are displayed in the Grant wizard in Authority Manager allowing the user to make the choices for each limit. Some limits allow more than one selection. All limits require at least one selection.
Student Systems and Data
admit center (1 or more)item type (1 or more and ranges allowed)
Financial Systems GL
project (1 or more; or ""all"")task (1 or more; or ""all"")award (1 or more; or ""all"")principal owner (1 only)spending limit (1 only)

NOTIFICATION
Authority Manager sends email notifications to grantors and recipients of authority for various reasons, including:
new authority grantedauthority limits or conditions changedprerequisites to be met, with a reminder after 14 daysauthority condition will expire in 30 days, with a reminder at 7 daysauthority condition has expiredassignments of authority-granting proxy or acting approverreminders when acting approver starts and ends
Wherever possible, notifications of a given type are combined into one daily email. Some situations (such as an acting approver assignment that starts immediately) trigger an immediate notification.
NOTIFICATION FOR REQUESTS
Authority Manager sends email notifications for different types of authority requests to grantors, requesters, FYI contacts and grantees of authority, including:
new authority request submitted to copy/edit/revokeauthority request reassigned to the new approverauthority request approved/deniedauthority request canceled
​ORGANIZATION
Any department or group in the official University structure. All privileges are granted in the context of an organization; a manager can grant authority only within her own organization and its sub-organizations.
Note that the organization applies to the privilege, not the recipient of the authority.Example: A director might grant some authority for a project owned by her organization to a person in another organization.
PREREQUISITE
Some privileges have requirements (successful completion of training, signature on file, etc.) that must be met by the individual before the privilege can take effect.
When a prerequisite is completed, the individual is added to a special workgroup, and Authority Manager is notified to activate the pending authority.
PRIVILEGE
A specific task or set of tasks that can be granted to an individual. Privileges are self-contained — for example, the ""administer leave"" privilege covers all the data and tasks required to do that job, in all affected business systems.

RESTORE
The ability to reinstate authority by individual privilege. You can only restore those privileges that you can grant.
REVOKE
The act of removing authority. You can only remove authority that you have been authorized to extend to others.
SCOPE
The organization to which an authority assignment applies.
SYSTEMS AUTHORITY
Access to the portions of Stanford business systems that contain data or tasks related to a specified privilege.
SYSTEM OWNER
Individuals who have any grantable privilege scoped to Stanford University are system owners for the authority subsystem that includes that privilege.

Steps to complete training
This section gives an overview of how your prerequisite status flows through the university business systems, and how soon you can expect your authority to be activated.

You complete the prerequisite.

You can complete prerequisites before or after the authority is granted. You will receive a reminder email if you haven't completed a prerequisite after 14 days. (After 300 days, any pending authority for which you still have not completed prereqs will be invalidated. You will need the authority revoked and granted again.)
Register in STARS to complete most training.
Clarify with your manager or the person granting you authority what course to take.


A person or an automated process records your status.

Online/self-paced or classroom training: In most cases, STARS updates your completed status automatically. Updates are posted four times daily, between 9:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m.
Signature required: On receipt of your signed confidentiality agreement, Controller’s Office staff update your completed status. OR on receipt of your certificate of completion, AS staff update your completed status.
Allow 1-2 business days for inter-office mail.
Allow 1-2 business days for staff to update your status.


Authority Manager is notified.

Background processes run continually to check for status changes and update your information as needed. For about 15 minutes (to a maximum of two hours), your status will display as pending but complete.


Oracle Financials, PeopleSoft, ReportMart, etc. are notified.

Authority Manager sends a message to the business systems to let them know your authority can be activated.
In about 15 minutes (to a maximum of two hours), your assignment status will be updated as active in Authority Manager, but is not yet effective in the business systems.



When will my prerequisite status be updated?
If it's taking significantly more time to activate your authority than the guidelines above indicate, please submit a Help request to let us know that processing may be stalled."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Authority Setup Utility,"Bulk load specification and process
The team for the business system area will complete all of the NEW authority setup in UAT before proceeding. This must be done using the Authority Manager setup Apex application.

A system area team member will then use the Grant Super User to grant the newly created authority setup to a SUNet ID— i.e., hennessy or some other appropriate initial grantor.
This team will then create tab-delimited input files for all assignments which are to be bulk loaded.
Bulk loading of initial assignments into Authority Manager UAT can then be completed using the  Bulk Load Authority.
Once the authority setup is ready to be moved to production the MaIS team will export the setup from UAT and import it into production
The MaIS team will then use the Grant Super User to grant the newly created authority setup to a SUNet ID— i.e., hennessy or some other appropriate initial grantor.
The last step is that the MaIS team will use the tab-delimited file to complete the production bulk load.

File Requirements
	1. The tab-delimited file should contain one row per authority assignment.
	2. The file should contain the following columns of data for each row in the order specified:
		2.1. grantor (one of the following)
				university id (univid) of the grantor of authority
				SUNet id (sunetid) of the grantor of authority
				registry object id (roid) of the grantor of authority 
		2.2. id of grantee (one of the following)
				university id (univid) of the recipient of authority 
				SUNet id (sunetid) of the recipient of authority

Overview
Choosing a SUNet ID
Services
Eligibility
Base Services
Authority
Activation


Overview
The SUNet ID is an account name that identifies you, uniquely and permanently, as a member of the Stanford community. It is recorded in Stanford business systems and is visible to university employees. It's what you'll use to log into most secure online services. Your SUNet ID and password supply your online credentials; your access to specific online services is determined by your eligibility and authority.
Ownership of a SUNet ID is governed by university policy as expressed in Administrative Guide 64.
Choosing a SUNet ID
Your SUNet ID is:

permanently assigned to you. Once you've claimed a SUNet ID, it will never be reassigned. You cannot easily change your SUNet ID.
not private. You can control whether it is displayed in Stanford's online directory and you can create an alias to use as your email address, but your actual SUNet ID will remain visible in university business systems and reports and may be requested as an identifier by university staff.
not anonymous. Your SUNet ID is directly associated with you, unlike a social network ID or email address that may mask your identity.

As your relationship with Stanford changes — through graduation, employment, retirement, etc. — the status of your SUNet ID will change from active to inactive and back, but your SUNet ID itself does not change.
This means that a great many SUNet IDs are reserved but not currently active. In addition, StanfordYou allows you to create two SUNet ID aliases to use as alternate email/web addresses. Once an alias becomes inactive, it is reserved for at least two years, during which time it can be re-used only by its original owner.
As a result, you may be required to select a SUNet ID that is not your first choice, even though the one you want may not be currently in use.
Don't let your frustration with not getting the SUNet ID you want lead you to select one you'll later regret. Choose one you'll be confident to say aloud to your manager, professor, or colleagues. 
We understand that you cannot foresee life changes that may make your SUNet ID inappropriate after the fact. Therefore, in extremely rare cases a request to change a SUNet ID may be approved. Changing a SUNet ID requires substantial effort from several different campus offices, and can result in disruption of your services during the transition.
Services
The following table lists the Stanford online services to which your SUNet ID may give you access (depending on your eligibility). Services are grouped into ""full"" and ""base"" packages.

Eligibility
Once you have a SUNet ID and password, you may be eligible for a package of Stanford online services that includes email, AFS, and web hosting. Services may be turned on or off as your eligibility changes.
There are two types of eligibility for SUNet services:

University-eligible: you automatically receive services because of your status at the university
Sponsored: an authorized university employee has agreed to extend services to you for a fixed period of timeSee the Sponsorship service page for more information.

Service ""packages"" are defined as:

Base 

SUNet ID (login ID)
directory listing in StanfordWho(more about what you can do with base services, below) 


Full (sponsored) = base services plus:

email service
Web service
AFS storage space
email list service


Full (University-eligible) = all above services plus:

free or discounted software



If you have a SUNet ID, but are neither University-eligible for services nor sponsored for a service package, your SUNet ID is considered inactive and can't be used for anything.
Base services
The base service level means that you have an entry in the Stanford directory (StanfordWho) and can be recognized and identified by your SUNet ID and password. Individual services may grant you access based on your identity. At a minimum, you can:

login to Axess (recent alumni only)
login to StanfordYou to maintain your contact information for your directory listing
login via WebLogin to any protected web site to which your SUNet ID has been given specific access via a workgroup or access control list

Examples of some of the things you can (and cannot) do with a base-level SUNet ID:

Recent alumni (for five years after graduation) can log into axess.stanford.edu to request a transcript or change their address. No sponsorship required.


If your SUNet ID has been granted access to a secure Stanford website, you'll be able to log into that website via your browser. Sponsorship may be required, if you're not otherwise eligible for base service.


You cannot maintain your own Stanford website or FTP files to any Stanford website, regardless of the access control lists for that website.


If someone grants a temporary employee authority to do tasks in Oracle Financial Systems, that person will be able to to log into Oracle Financials. No sponsorship required.


If someone grants a regular employee authority to do tasks in Oracle Financial Systems after that person leaves Stanford (rare, but possible), that person will be able to to log into Oracle Financials until that authority expires. Sponsorship required.

Authority
A person with a SUNet ID can be assigned authority to do specific tasks in Stanford's business systems. This authority is independent of that person's eligibility for other online services.
For example, a temporary staff person who is eligible only for a base-level SUNet ID might be granted authority to do some registration tasks in PeopleSoft Student Administration. That temp staffer would not have Stanford email or other services that come with a full SUNet ID, but would be able to log into PeopleSoft SA to do their work.
For more information about authority and how it is managed at Stanford, see the Authority Manager page.
Service activation
If you are on campus and are University-eligible for a full-service SUNet ID, your services — including email — will be activated within four to six hours of sponsorship.
Otherwise, activation of services may take longer, from a few days to several months.

Contingent students. Base services will be active as soon as you get your SUNet ID. Full services will be activated within 24 hours of your official acceptance of Stanford's admittance offer.
Graduate students. Base services will be active as soon as you get your SUNet ID. Full services for all incoming graduate students are activated on a date determined by the Registrar each year; this date typically falls in late summer.
Individuals requiring sponsorship. No services can be activated until your SUNet ID is sponsored by Stanford faculty or staff. Contact your departmental administrator to request sponsorship. The service level selected by the sponsor will be activated within four to six hours of sponsorship (if sponsorship begins immediately), or at midnight on a future date specified by the sponsor."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Create and Delete Workgroups in Workgroup Manager,"Create a workgroup
All Stanford community members with active SUNet IDs can create personal groups with their ~sunetid stem. To create a group with an organizational stem, you must be a designated maintainer for that stem. 
If you know a stem exists, and you need to be able to create and maintain groups with that stem, please submit a Help ticket. Also, submit a Help ticket if you need a new stem created for a group or project.
University IT recommends that the stem be more than eight characters. It should also be limited to alpha and numeric characters, underscores, or dashes.

Log in to Workgroup Manager.
Click the Create Workgroup tile, or icon in the upper left-hand corner.
Click the Group name part A drop-down menu. All the stems for which you are a maintainer (including your ~sunetid stem) will be listed. Select your desired stem or submit a Help ticket if you do not see a stem that you think you should have access to.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Inactive Workgroup Members,"Inactive members are removed automatically
Workgroup Manager will automatically remove inactive members from a workgroup. Members are inactive when they leave Stanford and no longer have an active SUNet ID.
After members have been inactive for 72 hours, they are automatically removed from all workgroups to which they belong.
Exceptions

Inactive members are not removed from training workgroups.
If the last administrator for a workgroup becomes inactive, they will be removed. The workgroup will continue to exist without administrators. There will no impact to the active members of the workgroup.
If the inactive member is the only administrator of a group off a personal stem (e.g., ~jdoe), no action is taken.  The inactive member remains the administrator on the personal stem."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Nest Workgroups in Workgroup Manager,"Workgroup Manager allows you to nest groups in other groups, which lets you avoid duplication of effort and helps ensure consistency and accuracy in your groups. Nesting looks like this:

uit:webcreators

(i) icon John Smith
(i) icon Jane Doe
(i) icon uit:documentation
(i) icon
(i) icon sulair:dreamweaver-users



In this (hypothetical) example, University IT has created a workgroup within its stem, called ""uit:webcreators,"" to include people whose work involves designing and creating websites.

Three groups have been nested within the uit:webcreators workgroup — these are workgroups belonging to UIT and other organizations, whose membership is directly related to the purpose of this workgroup.
Two individual members, John Smith and Jane Doe, are in organizations that don't have a web workgroup, so they have been added directly to uit:webcreators.

How does nesting help?

The owner of uit:webcreators only had to include five members — two direct members and three nested groups — though the actual membership of the workgroup consists of the combined memberships.
When a new employee joins the web team in the Office of University Communications, her manager adds her to the ouc:website workgroup, and she automatically becomes a member of uit:webcreators.
Only the individual members who don't belong to an appropriate sub-group are added directly to the larger workgroup. This makes it easier to see which members are exceptions.

Workgroups with nested subgroups will be listed slightly differently in your Workgroup Manager home page list of groups. The Number of Members column will display the number of direct members, with an asterisk to indicate there are nested groups whose membership is not included in the count. To see the total number of members in the workgroup, click the (i) icon (in the first column) to see the membership details.
Nest a workgroup
To nest a workgroup: 

Log in to Workgroup Manager.

Restrictions



Nesting controls whether your workgroup can be included (nested) in the membership or administrators of any other workgroup, or only workgroups with the same stem as yours. If you restrict nesting after a workgroup has been nested in another workgroup, the existing nesting relationship will not change. If you want the workgroup to be removed from any umbrella workgroups, contact the owners of those workgroups. The workgroups in which your group is nested are listed on the Properties tab.
Visibility controls whether or not your workgroup will appear in search results for Workgroup Manager users who are not administrators of your workgroup.
Membership filter: Set conditions for membership in your workgroup. There are three filter options:

No filter: Anyone can be a member of your workgroup, even after they leave Stanford.
Stanford academic & administrative communities: People in your workgroup must have an active affiliation with Stanford. People who no longer meet this requirement will be filtered out.
Specific affiliation (students, faculty, and/or staff): Select one or more of these affiliations. Selecting all three results in a more restricted set than option 2. 





Members who are filtered out of your workgroup still appear on the Members tab in Workgroup Manager but are not counted in its membership and don't have any of the privileges associated with membership in the group. You can click the (i) icon next to the member's name to see the reason the person is filtered out."

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Some Third-Party Web Sites Do Not Work Without a Stanford Email Address,"What is the problem?
Many third party services assume that everyone with a SUNetID has a Stanford email address.  That is not always true; many sponsored SUNetIDs do not come with Stanford email service, and some SUNetIDs keep their email address private.  These users may face problems authenticating to certain third-party web sites.
This problem affects you if…

You are trying to access a third-party web site;
When logging in to the third-party web site, you were sent through login.stanford.edu; and
After going through login.stanford.edu, you got an email address-related error.

How do I fix it?
If you have a Stanford email address, you can fix the problem by changing the visibility level of your email address.  If you do not have a Stanford email address, you can fix the problem by providing a third-party email address.
The procedure for both fixes is the same: 

Begin by logging in to StanfordYou [link will open in a new window].
Once logged in, click Maintain your directory and AlertSU emergency contact information.
In the SU Contact Info section, click change…
You will now be at a page where you can change your published email address.
There are two settings to check:

Either select a Stanford email address, or enter a third-party email address.
Set your Email visibility to either 'Public' or 'Stanford'.


Finally, save your changes.

What happens next?
Once your email address has been entered, the change will propagate the Stanford Directory service (LDAP).  The next time you log in to a third-party web site using Stanford credentials, your email address will be provided to the third-party.
It can take up to an hour for your change to propagate.  If an hour has passed and you are still facing issues, first try clearing your browser cache (or logging in using a different browser).  If that still does not solve the issue, then submit a help ticket."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Grant Authority,"These instructions reflect a new interface and features that will appear in Authority Manager starting June 21, 2021.




Authority Manager lets you grant systems authority to persons whose job requires them to access Stanford business systems.  You grant a privilege to an eligible person and set scope, limits, and conditions on the privilege. A privilege is a specific task or set of tasks that can be granted to an individual. The result is recorded as an assignment. Certain privileges have prerequisites (such as training) that the recipient must complete before the assignment can take effect.
You are allowed to grant only the authority that has been granted to you with the ""can grant"" or ""can only grant"" condition. You can view the authority for which you have grantable access in the authority-granting wizard by clicking the My Authority tile on the Authority Manager homepage. Only individuals in the Stanford administrative and academic communities can receive authority.
When you grant a privilege, you can opt to have it start immediately or set a future start date to activate the authority later.
Grant privileges for which you have grantable access

On the Authority Manager homepage, click the Grant Authority tile or the Grant Authority icon on the left menu to launch the Grant Authority Wizard. Populate the information as described in steps 2 through 8 below.


Enter the SUNet ID (preferred) or name of the person to be granted authority in the Select the person to be granted authority field. The search results will include only members of the Stanford academic and administrative communities — that is, people who are eligible to hold authority.
Select the privilege you want to grant. Click the more info icon to see what privileges are included in the business function, prerequisites, and other related privileges.​Note: The list that appears will only include the privileges you have access to grant.
Select the organization and the scope.
a. Org scope may be different from the organization for which the person works.
b. Select the lowest-level organization required to support the tasks the person will be doing.
c. The wizard automatically lists all the active organizations for which you can grant authority.
d. In the results list, organizations that meet your search criteria, but for which you do not have granting authority, are not linked.

Select a value for limits, if applicable.
a. If there are no limits for this privilege, the limits step will be skipped.
b. If there is one limit, you must select or enter a value for the limit (detailed constraints on the person's authority, such as a spending limit, a project, an admit center, and so on).
c. If there are several limits, each limit will be displayed in turn and you must select or enter a value for each one.

Select conditions for this privilege, such as whether it can be granted forward. (Scroll down the page to the ""Authority Conditions"" section to read more about authority conditions.)
Indicate an effective start date. Start dates can be set for a future date if you want to activate the authority later. If desired, set an override expiration date.Note: Unless you set an expiration date, all privileges remain in place until they are revoked or until the person leaves Stanford. There may be situations where you want to set an employee an expiration date override for when a privilege should terminate. For example, you may wish to assign privileges to someone for three months while a co-worker is out on leave. In the majority of cases, you will not want to set a date. 
Add optional comments and click Grant Authority to save.​
You will see a confirmation that the assignment is complete and if there are prerequisites that must be completed. The person you have granted authority to will receive an email notification about this authority, including information on any incomplete prerequisites. Click Grant Another if you are not finished. Once the prerequisites (if there are any) are satisfied, all authority grants take effect within one business day.

Understand Authority Conditions
Assignments scoped to a PI cannot be made grantable. Can ONLY grant is not available for all privileges.
Cannot grant: this person will have the authority to do the tasks associated with the granted privilege, but cannot grant this authority to anyone else
CAN grant: this person will have the authority to do the tasks associated with the granted privilege, and can grant the same authority to others

select this option only when the individual has a legitimate reason to delegate authority to others (for example, a manager)
this person can designate an authority-granting proxy (someone who can grant authority on their behalf)

Can ONLY grant [not available for all privileges]: this person will NOT have the authority to do the tasks associated with the granted privilege, and will not be in the approvals workflow.

select this option when the individual has a legitimate reason to delegate authority to others, but should not be in the workflow, or should not be doing the associated tasks themselves
this person can grant this privilege to anyone else, and will be able to select ""can/cannot/can only"" for that person
his person can designate an authority-granting proxy (someone who can grant authority on their behalf)


View completed assignments
When the assignment is complete:

The summary panel displays the condition you have selected, e.g., ""can grant-only"" in the image below.
The authority view for this person will show the privilege in italics.
The status column will show ""Grant-only,"" and the Grantable column will have a checkmark.

Edit privileges
To change the person's granting status or any other limits on the privilege, click the checkbox under the Reset button to the right of the privilege you want to edit authority. This will take you back to the granting-authority wizard. Click the  Request dropdown arrow and select the appropriate action.
Organization hierarchy
It's important to understand how the University Org Chart works when granting authority. Every employee at Stanford works for a particular organization, and every financial account is associated with a particular organization. These organizations are designated by a four-letter code in the administrative systems. A person may have authority over any organization, and granting authority at a parent level org also grants authority to any child orgs under that parent level organization. For example, granting authority to someone using the Hoover Institution org code (AGBS), also grants them authority over Hoover Institution Operations (AGFO), Program Development (AGNG), Resource Development (AGUY), Operations (AHCQ), Research (AHKI), and Hoover Library/Archives (AHSA).
You can also grant authority at higher or lower levels on the org tree to include more or less access accordingly. For example, you could grant authority to just the Hoover Library/Archives (AHSA), limiting the grant to that child org only, or you could grant authority at the President's Office (AAAA), which grants authority over all of the Hoover Institute orgs, and all of the other orgs that report to the President's Office.
There are some privileges that do not require or allow specific organization scope. These privileges default the organization's scope to Stanford University (AA00) upon selection."

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Link a Workgroup to Active Directory,"For services that leverage the Active Directory (Windows) infrastructure for authentication and authorization, you can create an integration between a workgroup and an Active Directory Authentication Group in the WIN.STANFORD.EDU realm. Once created, these authorization groups can be used by services that authenticate via Active Directory (AD).
For a new Active Directory group linkage you must accept the default name offered and not change it. The default name is the name of your workgroup. However, an Active Directory group name cannot contain colons (:) so these are replaced with hyphens (-). For example, the default name for the mais:website-editor workgroup is mais-website-editor. If an Active Directory group already exists, the linking will simply be established with the existing group.

Once the linkage between the workgroup and the mailing list is created, you must use Workgroup Manager to maintain membership. Otherwise, the workgroup and mailing list can fall out of sync.
Notes

You can only link to an existing mailing list for which you are the administrator.
You can change the name of the pre-populated mailing list.
Unlinking the workgroup from the mailing list only removes the linkage — it does not modify the mailing list.

Computers & Laptops,VLRE for Windows Troubleshooting,"VLRE for Windows is composed of two main components and a number of support files. The two main components are:
VLRE serviceCompliance Checker
The VLRE service is responsible for running the Compliance Checker every hour. Once per hour it checks to see if there is an active network connection. If there is network connectivity the VLRE service runs the Compliance Checker. If the network is not available, it waits another hour.
The Compliance Checker examines the PC to see if it meets the minimum security standards. It sends the results of the check to the VLRE server, which is then responsible for informing MyDevices of the results. If the operating system is 32-bit, VLREComplianceCheck.exe runs. If the operating system is 64-bit, VLREComplianceCheck64.exe runs.
If you suspect that the Windows version of VLRE is not working properly, try the following steps to identify and fix the problem.
Check the Windows Event ViewerCheck the VLRE service statusRun the VRLE Compliance CheckerRun the Stanford Compliance Checker
VLRE log files
VLRE for Windows 1.1 and later can write log files to various locations. Additional information about these logs, which can be invaluable for troubleshooting, is below.
VLRE Compliance Checker:C:\ProgramData\Stanford\VLRE\vlre.logVLRE Update Check:C:\Users\UserID\AppData\Roaming\Stanford\VLRE\vlre_update_required.logVLRE Service:Computer Management (Windows Start Menu) > Event Viewer  > Windows Logs > Application list. You can filter the events that are displayed, by selecting  Filter Log and choosing the event source VLRE_Service.VLRE Installer:Note that these files are only of interest if there was a problem with installing VLRE in the first place.C:\ProgramData\Stanford\Logs\VLREinstaller.logC:\ProgramData\Stanford\Logs\StanfordEncryptionInstaller.log
Check the Windows Event Viewer
If the VLRE service experiences problems, it writes details that describe the problem to the application log.
Launch  Computer Management and navigate to Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Application.  Select Filter Current Log to filter the events that are displayed.For Event sources, select VLRE_Service and click OK.Examine the VLRE service events to see what the problem is. In the example below, it appears that the VLRE service is constantly killing the compliance checker.
Check the VLRE service status
Make sure that the VLRE service is running.
Launch Computer Management and navigate to Services and Applications > Services. Select Stanford VLRE Service in the list of services.Double-click the Stanford VLRE Service entry in the list to display the service properties.
If the service is not running, try starting it.If the service is running, try restarting it.Check the  Startup type.  It should be Automatic (Delayed Start).If the service is not starting within a reasonable time after the computer is rebooted, try changing the Startup type to Automatic.

Run the VLRE Compliance Checker from the command line
Some problems can be identified by manually running the VLRE Compliance Checker program from the command line and examining the program output.
The VLRE Compliance Checker comes in a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version:
Compliance Checker for 32-bit operating system: C:\ProgramData\Stanford\VLRE\VLREComplianceCheck.exeCompliance Checker for 64-bit operating system: C:\ProgramData\Stanford\VLRE\VLREComplianceCheck64.exe
First, make sure that the VLRE Compliance Checker is not running. If it is, either end the process from Task Manager or wait for it to finish (the program allows only one instance of itself to run).Run the VLRE Compliance Checker and redirect its output to a text file:
64-bit Windows OS:C:\ProgramData\Stanford\VLRE\VLREComplianceCheck64.exe /Debug /Verbose /UseProductionServer > outputfile.txt32-bit Windows OS:C:\ProgramData\Stanford\VLRE\VLREComplianceCheck.exe /Debug /Verbose /UseProductionServer > outputfile.txt
Examine outputfile.txt looking for error messages or data that seems inconsistent or wrong.If logging was turned on when VLRE was installed, check the C:\ProgramData\Stanford\VLRE\vlre.log file.
Run the Stanford Compliance Checker
Download and run the Stanford Compliance Checker for Windows.If the information displayed on the summary screen does not help, generate a report. On the File menu, click Save Report.Examine the report and look for errors and anomalies.
If all else fails
Try uninstalling and then reinstalling VLRE.

You need the following to use Target Display Mode:

A Mac notebook or desktop with a Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt port. If your Mac has Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, you can connect it using the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter.
A Thunderbolt cable or a Mini DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable  
A supported iMac with OS X v10.6.1 or later

See the list below for iMac models that support Target Display Mode, the type of cable you need to connect that model of iMac, and the kind of port you need on your other Mac.

iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and later iMac models can't be used as Target Display Mode displays.

Use Target Display Mode
Follow these steps to start using your iMac as a display:

Make sure that your iMac is turned on, and the other Mac is logged in to a macOS user account.
Connect the Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable between the two computers.
Press Command-F2 on the keyboard of the iMac that you want to use as a display.

After you press Command-F2, your iMac displays the desktop from the connected Mac.

If Command-F2 doesn't work
If your iMac doesn't switch to Target Display Mode when you press Command-F2, check these things:

Make sure that the iMac you're trying to use as a display supports Target Display Mode. 
Target Display Mode works only when your primary Mac is logged in to a macOS user account. For example, if your first Mac is at the FileVault login screen, pressing Command-F2 on your iMac does not enable Target Display Mode. You must first log in to your Mac (using a regular display, if necessary) before you can use an iMac in Target Display Mode.
Make sure that you're pressing Command-F2 on the keyboard that's connected to the iMac you want to use as a display.
In Keyboard System Preferences, if the checkbox is enabled for ""Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys,"" the key combination changes to Command-Fn-F2.
Make sure that your Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable is connected to both computers.
If you're currently logged in on the iMac you want to use as a display, try logging out to return to the login window. Then press Command-F2 again.
Some older Apple keyboards and third-party keyboards might not allow Command-F2 to toggle display modes. If this happens, use the keyboard that came with your iMac to toggle Target Display Mode on and off. 
If your iMac is currently started up in Windows, it won't enter Target Display Mode. Target Display Mode isn't supported in Boot Camp.


Exit Target Display Mode
To leave Target Display Mode, press Command-F2 on the iMac keyboard again. Your iMac also exits Target Display Mode if you disconnect the cable that connects the two computers, or if you shut down or sleep either computer.
If the connected Mac goes into sleep mode, the iMac screen turns off until you wake the other computer, or until you take your iMac out of Target Display Mode.

Display options
You can control the brightness of your iMac display while it's in Target Display Mode from a connected Mac. Use the Displays pane of System Preferences on the connected Mac, or use the brightness keys on the keyboard of the connected Mac.
To hear audio from a connected Mac using the built-in speakers of your iMac, select the iMac from the Sound pane of System Preferences. You can also use the sound and media keys on the keyboard of the connected Mac to adjust volume and control playback of iTunes and other media.
Connect more than one display
You can use multiple iMac computers as displays as long as each iMac is directly connected to a Thunderbolt port on your computer using a ThunderBolt cable. Each iMac you connect as a display counts towards the maximum number of simultaneously connected displays that your Mac supports.
Avoid trying to connect (chain) iMac computers that are in Target Display Mode to each other. Each iMac in Target Display Mode should be connected directly to a Mini DisplayPort or ThunderBolt port directly on the Mac where you want to use it as a display.
Use apps on your iMac
Any apps that are open on your iMac remain open and active while your iMac is in Target Display Mode. For example, if you begin playing music in iTunes on your iMac and then activate Target Display Mode, iTunes doesn't pause on your iMac.
If you've set your iMac to automatically log out, apps are paused or closed when this happens but your iMac remains in Target Display Mode.
Connect devices to your Mac
A Mac that's connected to an iMac in Target Display Mode can't use the iMac computer's built-in camera, its USB, ThunderBolt, or FireWire ports, or devices connected to those ports. To use external devices with your Mac, connect these devices directly to the Mac that you want to use them with.

Recommended Best Practices for Computer Maintenance
RESTART ONCE A WEEK
All laptops, desktops, iPads, or phones should be restarted at least once a week to allow updates, clean the cache, and keep systems running at their best. A slow-running computer, in many cases, is a clear indication that memory is limited and needs to be released. A simple restart refreshes all the system memory registers, making them ready to start over again. If your computer is being restarted on a more consistent basis, it will keep it running optimally over time.
Update your location information in Stanford You  https://stanfordyou.stanford.edu
PERFORM SYSTEM UPDATES REGULARLY
Whenever you are prompted to run the Windows update on PCs or the system updates on Mac devices, please run them as soon as possible.  These can be run at lunchtime or before you leave for the day to enable them to complete.  DO NOT turn off machines while making updates, as that can greatly affect your system.  There will be a reboot required once the updates are complete.  If run regularly, it should not take more than a few minutes each time. 
For Apple devices:  Click the Apple in the top left corner of the Mac Menu Bar, click System Settings, then Software update.
For Dell devices:  Type windows update in the search field on the toolbar, select Update
** NOTE: For complete operating system releases, please wait until the first updated version comes out prior to running **
BACK UP MACHINES WITH CRASHPLAN
Crashplan (CP) is Stanford’s backup utility to create a secure encrypted backup of locally stored data from your machine to the secure cloud.  All Stanford assets should have the application installed and associated with the primary owner's Sunet ID.  Please validate that CrashPlan is running by clicking the Folder icon in the Mac Menu Bar, opening the application with your Sunet information, and running the backups.  If you do not have CrashPlan, you can request support via TDSHelp.stanford.edu, or call the TDS Service Desk for assistance. 
 
ADDING OR REMOVING DEVICES
Any time you receive a new machine, pad, or phone, or are planning to surplus an old device, please make the updates in:
https://mydevices.stanford.edu   Register new or remove previously registered desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones used for Stanford work and/or accessing the Stanford network.  https://amie.stanford.edu   Update your attestation, ensuring that each device found in MyDevices has also been attested for high-risk data to avoid security compliance audit discrepancies that can lead to your Sunet being disabled. 
DISPOSING STANFORD ASSETS
Disposal/eRecycling of electronic devices is handled by Surplus Sales with the Office of Research Administration
https://ora.stanford.edu/ora-units/property-management-office/surplus-property-sales/surplus-property-disposals
TDS does not need to be involved in the disposal of assets between departments and Surplus Sales. We can assist in re-imaging machines AFTER they are sold back to individuals or departments via Surplus Sales.
*** NOTE: Apple systems, make sure to log out of your Apple account and turn off Find My Device tracking so the machine can be resold or disposed of. 
Turn off Find My on your devices and items - Apple Support
 USING PERSONAL MACHINES / MACHINE LIFESPAN
Using personal machines for Stanford work should be very limited.   Field Support is not able to work on personal devices other than to help make the machine compliant.  If Personally owned devices have hardware issues, the customer will be required to take care of those repairs on their own.  We recommend the departments provide Stanford-owned devices for their staff/ faculty, especially when accessing high-risk data
We recommend that Stanford-owned machines be replaced at least every 5 years for best performance. Current hardware warranties expire after 3 years."

Computers & Laptops,VLRE for Mac Troubleshooting,"If you suspect the Mac version of VLRE is not working properly, try the following steps in the order listed to identify and fix the problem.

Check the VLRE Log file in Console.app.
Run VLRE manually in Terminal.app.
Download and run ComplianceChecker.app.
Remove and reinstall VLRE.
Submit a Help ticket.

Check the VLRE Log file in Console.app
If VLRE is at version 1.1 or later and you have selected to enable logging during the installation you can view the results of the hourly VLRE check-ins.
To inspect the VLRE log file:

Launch Applications > Utilities > Console.app. 
Navigate to /Library/Logs/Stanford/vlre.log.Each entry is separated by ""================================"" (a series of equal signs). 
Note the date and time of the last entry. It should be within the past 2 hours unless the Mac has been powered off or in “sleep” mode. 
The last line of each check-in entry includes the text “Updated database record for VLRE ID xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx“. 
If that text is not present or the last run time is more than 2 hours in the past while the Mac has been powered on and not in “sleep” mode, manually run VLRE in Terminal.app.

Manually run VLRE in Terminal.app

Launch Applications > Utilities > Terminal.app. 
Enter the following command into the terminal: sudo /Library/Application\ Support/Stanford/VLRE/VLRE 
Press RETURN. 
If the check-in was successful you will see the following text: 
If you do not see the text in the step above, run the command in Terminal.app again and add “-debug” to the end of the command. sudo /Library/Application\ Support/Stanford/VLRE/VLRE -debug 
Copy all the resulting text and paste it into a text file. Save the file in case you need to submit a Help ticket.

Download and run ComplianceChecker.app

Download ComplianceChecker for Mac. 
Mount the disk image. 
Run Compliance Checker.pkg This installs the ComplianceChecker.app into “tmp” space and launches it. (At the next logout or reboot the ComplianceChecker.app will be deleted automatically.) 
Examine the information in the item labeled Monitoring System. This will tell you if VLRE is working correctly.

Remove and reinstall VLRE

Download and run VLRE Cleaner.pkg. 
VLRE Cleaner.pkg is downloaded to the default downloads location with Safari.app. 
Launch VLRE Cleaner.pkg. 
After running VLRE Cleaner.pkg confirm that /Library/Application Support/Stanford/VLRE/ contains only files called vlre_config.plist and VLRE_ID.txt.

If the VLRE client might have been copied from another computer (for example, by way of a Time Machine back-up), and if that previous computer will remain in use, be sure to delete VLRE_ID.txt manually, or else the old and the new systems will have the same VLRE client ID. 


Launch a browser and get the latest version of VLRE for Mac from the VLRE service site. 
Mount the InstallVLREencrypt.dmg file. 
Run VLREInstaller.pkg.

Computers & Laptops,How to Gain Access to the Network from a New SoM Device,"The primary method for gaining network access is by our Self Registration service. This process can be used by most computers, Apple mobile devices (e.g. iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad), and Androids.
What Is Self Registration?
Stanford Network Self Registration (SNSR) is a service that allows anyone with a SUNet ID to register their computer or mobile device's network connections with the School of Medicine. Simply plugging in to any network jack in the School of Medicine or connecting to the ""Stanford"" wireless network and then opening a web browser will direct you to the self registration page. The process will then register all wireless and wired network cards (if applicable) for use on the School of Medicine network. This is compatible with Windows as well as Mac OS X. This process is not compatible with Linux.
Process For Self Registration

Your device must be set for DHCP (which obtains an IP address automatically). This is the default setup for most devices.
Plug in your computer's Ethernet port into any School of Medicine network jack. This will give your computer an IP address of 10.65.x.x which will allow you to self register. To use self registration over the wireless network, connect to the ""Stanford"" wireless network. This will give your computer or mobile device an IP address of 10.22.x.x.
Open a web browser and follow the online instructions.
The self registration utility will ensure certain requirements are met, and fix them and install software if necessary.
When the process completes, your computer or mobile device should be registered within 30 minutes. If it is not working then, you may try rebooting your device.
If your device is not working after that, please call the IRT Service Desk at (650) 725-8000.

To learn more, see Gaining Access to the Network."
