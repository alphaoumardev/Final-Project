The Alumni Office also provides a detailed FAQ specifically for alumni. What You’ll Need to Claim your Harvardkey Employees, students, program participants, library borrowers, sponsored roles Access to the email address Harvard has on file for you*: This is commonly known as the onboard email. Your Harvard University ID (HUID)*: This is an 8-digit number that is used as a unique identifier at Harvard. Your last name and date of birth: This will help us confirm your identity * If you’re unsure of your HUID or which email address Harvard has on file, contact the person or office responsible for your onboarding to confirm this information. Alumni Access to the primary email address Harvard has on file for you: If you don’t have a primary email address on file, or don’t have access to the one that is on file contact the Alumni & Development Services Office for assistance. Your Harvard Alumni Association ID (HAA ID): This is a 10-digit number, unique to you, which can be found in the footer of any email sent to you by the Harvard Alumni Association, such as HAA Events or the Harvard Alumni Gazette.

Click the link or copy it into a web browser and enter your confirmation code. You must do this step within 30 minutes of the last step. Next Steps Activate multifactor authentication Many applications require multifactor authentication. Activate multifactor authentication with HarvardKey to make sure you can access all the Harvard resources you need. If you're an alumni, you aren't required to do this. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of security designed to ensure that you’re the only person who can access your account. It requires that you verify your identity using multiple types of information, such as something you know (a password), something you have (a registered phone or hardware token) or something you are (your face or fingerprint). Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Learn more about the phased rollout of this technology. Update Stored Passwords To avoid being locked out of your account, update any applications where you have your password stored, such as password managers like 1Password, LastPass or Apple Keychain. This also includes standalone apps (particularly mobile apps) for services like Google Drive or Office 365. You will also need to update your password on mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail on your tablet, phone and computer. Need help? If you're having trouble claiming your HarvardKey, submit a ticket or call 617-495-7777."
Accounts and Authentication,Prepare to leave Harvard University,"This page summarizes what happens to your online access once you leave Harvard University/your role becomes inactive. It also details when these access changes take effect. Access depends on your active affiliations - it is derived both from (1) your role (e.g. faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate) and also (2) your school or department. When you no longer have an active role your access will either end immediately, or it may continue for an extended period (known as a grace period). People can have more than one role at the same time. In that case, a status change that ends one of your roles will only affect access that is based on that role. For example, when a student graduates they will still have an active alumni role. That active role doesn't provide them the same access as when they were a student though. Another example would be a staff who retires. These role transitions affect access. Please note the following information does not apply to affiliations for roles at Harvard Business School. If you have a role associated with HBS, please ask the school's IT service desk what to do with your files and accounts when you leave the University and to confirm with them when your access to Harvard resources and services will end.

Here is some basic guidance to get you started with retaining your records and data, plus specific recommendations for each file type. General record recommendations Talk to co-workers and supervisors about the records you control that they may need access to after you leave Consult an approved Harvard records schedule like the General Records Schedule to determine whether they should be: Destroyed Sent to the Archives Passed on to a colleague These will be records which for some reason should not yet be destroyed or sent to the Archives You may have records going to multiple colleagues Note that retention and disposition (destruction or archives transfer) rules apply to paper, email, and electronic records. In addition to checking your own personal storage spaces (desk drawers, personal file cabinets and server space), be sure to check shared spaces, too. This is important where you are the primary custodian of groups of records in shared spaces (public file cabinets, group server space). Paper records Destroying paper records Shred them, either on-site or through a Records Management Services (RMS) destruction event Passing to a colleague Transfer them to the most appropriate colleague. Make sure that they are adequately labeled. Sending to the Archives Consult the RMS web site and/or contact RMS for instructions on sending paper records to the Archives Email Destroy emails and attachments Depending on the application, empty the trash or purge deleted messages Pass to a colleague In order to keep attachments connected to messages, this will likely require IT assistance Send to Harvard Archives Contact Records Management Services (RMS) to discuss the transfer of these records. IT will likely need to be involved Attachments must remain connected The particular email format must be acceptable to the Archives An appropriate transfer mechanism must be determined. For example, copying to a DVD might violate Harvard security policies Other Electronic Records Backing Up Personal and Departmental Files To learn how to backup your files from Microsoft 365, Dropbox and Google, please see this knowledge article. Qualtrics survey data When you leave Harvard, you will no longer be able to access your surveys or survey data through your Harvard Qualtrics account. Learn more about what happens to your Qualtrics survey data. Poll Everywhere data When you leave Harvard, you will no longer be able to access your Poll Everywhere data with your Harvard Key. If you wish to retain your data, please submit a ticket with Poll Everywhere Support Canvas When you leave Harvard, you will continue to have access to your Canvas sites via your HarvardKey, but course sites may be concluded and then your access will be limited. If you are a teaching staff member and would like to reuse your content at another institution, or have a copy for your own records, we suggest you export your course content before you leave. If you are a student and would like a copy of your assignment submissions, you may download assignment submissions from all of your courses as a single zip file. Adobe Creative Cloud Assets Prior to deactivation of your Harvard Adobe License, you may migrate assets stored in the Adobe Creative Cloud to a personal account that you can take with you. Details involved in this process can be found here: https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/migrate-student-assets.ug.html Please be sure to read the information before performing your migration so that you understand what will and will not be migrated. Be sure to read the FAQ at the bottom of the page as well. Some Important things to know about the migration process: Not all data qualifies for automatic migration. Some assets may need to be downloaded, moved, or re-created manually. The Personal Adobe account you create must be a new one with an email address that is not already attached to an Adobe ID. Free Adobe Personal accounts include 2GB of storage. The University licenses include 100GB of storage. If you have more than 2GB in your University Adobe account, ALL of your qualifying data will be migrated to the new account, but you will not be able to upload additional data to your new account until you either purchase more storage space or remove enough files to be under the 2GB limitation. To start your Asset migration for graduating students, please go to the following link: https://graduation.adobe.com/ Zoom Assets If you have any recurring meetings, please ask a colleague to create a new meeting series to replace yours, as it will end when your account closes. You can download any recordings you have prior to your last day: https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0067567#h_01F4F8Z2FJCCE6KVBPGHNZEXSC Other electronic records Destroy electronic records Delete the records Empty the recycle bin or trash Pass to a colleague Notify the colleague, with adequate description, of any records that are in shared spaces. Transfer records in personal space to the colleague. This might be done in several ways Transfer via removable media (DVD, thumb drive). Depending on the confidentiality of the records, this might violate Harvard security policies. Coordinate with the colleague to temporarily move the records through shared server space. Be careful, though. Depending on the confidentiality of the records, this might not be a good idea. Consult Information Security to find out more. Have your local IT team move the files directly from your personal server space to your colleague's server space. 1Password Shared vaults Shared vault managers must remove accounts that no longer require access to departmental vaults. Deleted business accounts will be automatically deprovisioned. Family members After the Harvard affiliate's role ends family member(s) will be prompted to enter in a credit card to continue 1Password access. If no payment method is provided, the family accounts go into a read-only mode and cannot be updated. Because the family accounts go into read-only mode, there should be no disruption of service. Student accounts A code will be provided to extend account for 4.25 years after graduation. After the code expires, users will be prompted to enter in a credit card to continue 1Password access."

Accounts and Authentication,How to Add or Remove Devices After Duo Two-step Activation,"Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users and users will be actively prompted to transition from Duo to Okta on a timeline based on their primary Harvard affiliation. If you have already switched to Okta or are interested in doing so, please refer to the article Remove a device/security method or end all active sessions through the Okta dashboard. These instructions are for Harvard users who want to add backup devices for two-step verification. It is highly encouraged that you have at least two devices configured for two-step verification. That way, if you can't access one device, you have another option for getting your code and signing in. Table of Contents Navigate to Duo’s Device Management page Add a New Device Rename or Remove a Device Device Management Notifications Navigate to Duo’s Device Management page Go to the site key.harvard.edu Scroll down to Manage Your Account & Services and click on Set Up & Manage Your Two-step Verification When prompted, sign into HarvardKey Add a New Device Step One: Select the Add a device To add a new method of verifying your identity in Duo, click Add a device and select one of the verification options. Step Two: Choose Your Verification Method Verification options will vary by device. Choose the device type in the list that matches your desired authentication experience.

This is an example of the options on a MacBook with Touch ID available: If you want to understand how each login method works, click on the link for your chosen method below. This will take you to Duo's instructions for a detailed explanation. Touch ID Login Experience: Use the fingerprint sensor on Apple MacBooks, Magic Keyboards, or iPhone. Face ID Login Experience: Use the face scanning feature on iPhone. Windows Hello Login Experience: Use your Windows Hello PIN, scan your fingerprint, or use facial recognition on Windows devices. Device Verification (Android Biometrics) Login Experience: Use Android Biometrics on Android devices. Duo Mobile Login Experience: Approve Duo Push verification requests on iOS or Android devices, or generate a one-time passcode from the Duo Mobile app. Security Key Login Experience: Tap a WebAuthN/FIDO2 security key. Requires Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge. Phone Number Login Experience: Receive a one-time passcode in an SMS message or approve a login attempt with a phone call from Duo. Step Three: Set Up Your Chosen Method After selecting how you want to verify your identity, you'll move forward to set it up. Duo will walk you through the steps, but if you want detailed set up instructions, click on the link for your chosen method below. This will take you to Duo's instructions for a detailed explanation. Set Up Touch ID Set Up Face ID Set Up Windows Hello Set Up Device Verification (Android Biometrics) Set Up Duo Mobile Set Up Security Key Set Up Phone Number Once you finish setting up your chosen verification method, your device can be used to log in to Duo-protected applications if you cannot access your primary device.

Accounts and Authentication,Duo to Okta transition: FAQ,"Harvard University is replacing Duo with Okta for identity verification when signing into HarvardKey-protected tools and resources. Okta offers enhanced authentication methods that allow you to verify your identity with your fingerprint, facial recognition, or device-specific PIN instead of entering your HarvardKey password. This keeps your account more secure and makes sign-in faster and easier. Okta also supports several alternative authentication methods for occasions when enhanced authentication is not possible or preferred. When is this happening? The transition from Duo to Okta is happening in phases between spring 2025 and spring 2026, based on roles or affiliations. You will be contacted by HUIT or your School’s local IT support when it’s time for you to make the switch. If you want to set up Okta sooner, you can do so at your convenience by following these step-by-step instructions. Do I have to switch to Okta? Yes, eventually. By spring 2026, all HarvardKey users will be required to have set up Okta to continue accessing HarvardKey-protected tools and resources. What do I need to do? Recommended: For the fastest, most secure sign-in experience, we strongly recommend setting up Okta Verify with FastPass enabled on all your devices that you use to access HarvardKey-protected apps and services. Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up Okta Verify with FastPass. Alternative: You can also set up Okta using alternative authentication methods such as hardware tokens, passkeys, or traditional multifactor authentication. Learn more about alternative authentication methods. What is Okta FastPass? At Harvard, we’ve used traditional multifactor (or “two-step”) authentication methods such as push notifications, phone calls, or SMS messages to verify your identity when signing into HarvardKey. Although these reduce the risk of your account being compromised, they still rely on entering a password, which can be stolen, guessed, or phished. With Okta Verify’s FastPass feature, you can verify your identity using your device’s built-in security mechanism (e.g., Touch ID, FaceID, PIN, Windows Hello) instead of entering your HarvardKey password. Sometimes known as “passwordless” authentication, this improves security and makes sign-in faster. You can use FastPass with: Your fingerprint or facial recognition (also known as “biometrics”) using your device’s built-in fingerprint or face authenticators (e.g. Windows Hello, Touch ID, Face ID). Because biometrics are unique to you and stored securely on your device, they are harder to steal, replicate, or hack compared to passwords, which can be guessed or shared. A device-specific PIN or passcode that is encrypted and tied exclusively to your device. Unlike a password, which works on any internet-connected device, this PIN only grants access on the device where it was set up. Even if stolen, a device-specific PIN is useless without physical access to your device. What are the other benefits of Okta FastPass? In addition to significantly improving security, FastPass makes signing in to HarvardKey faster and easier. Since you verify your identity directly on your device, there's no need to enter a password, wait for a push notification, or use a second device like your phone when signing in on your computer. Is my biometric data secure and private?  Yes. Your biometric data (face or fingerprint) is encrypted and stored only on your device—it is never shared with, nor can it be accessed by, Harvard or Okta. It is used solely to unlock access to HarvardKey. If you prefer not to use biometrics, you can opt for a device-specific PIN instead. What if I don’t have my devices with me? If you need to access a HarvardKey-protected tool or resource, but you don’t have access to any of your devices that have Okta set up, you can contact the HUIT Service Desk for help. Are there alternative authentication methods? Yes. If your device doesn’t support Okta Verify or you’re using a shared/public device, you may need to use an alternative authentication method, like a passkey or hardware token. You may also decide to set up an alternative authentication method as a backup. I currently use a YubiKey with Duo. Can I continue to use a YubiKey with Okta? Yes, you can continue to use a YubiKey with Okta. We may need to upgrade your YubiKey to meet Okta security requirements.  Can I still use traditional multifactor authentication? Yes. While we highly recommend setting up enhanced authentication, you can still verify your identity through Okta using a push notification or a unique six-digit one-time code. Okta does not support the use of SMS or phone calls as these are considered less secure verification methods. Learn more about multifactor authentication options. Where can I get help? We understand this is a big change, and we’re here to help. If you need help during the setup process or have questions about authentication methods, contact the HUIT Service Desk or your local IT support.

Accounts and Authentication,"Set up a hardware token (e.g., YubiKey) for use with Okta","Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. These instructions are for HarvardKey users who want to set up a hardware token, such as a YubiKey, for Okta passwordless or multifactor authentication (MFA), to provide an extra layer of security for accounts. A hardware token is a small, key-like device you plug into your computer to verify your identity. The most common hardware token used at Harvard is a YubiKey. YubiKeys with fingerprint sensors or that require a PIN, can be used for passwordless or multifactor authentication. YubiKeys that require a one-time passcode can be used for MFA only. Learn more about hardware tokens here - What Is a Security Token (or Authentication Token) and How Does It Work?. Hardware tokens as a security method are a good option when: Your device does not support passwordless options with Okta Verify and you want to use passwordless authentication. You are traveling to a high-risk country. You regularly use a shared computer, such as a lab computer, where you can’t have Okta Verify set up and you want to use passwordless authentication. You would like a highly secure backup method in case you experience issues with your primary device. Set up a hardware token If you don’t already have a hardware token, e.g., a Yubikey, you’ll need to buy one.

Accounts and Authentication,Use a hardware token to authenticate with Duo,"Harvard University is replacing Duo with Okta for identity verification when signing into HarvardKey-protected tools and resources. All new HarvardKey users will set-up Okta for identity verification when claiming their account. Existing Duo users will transition from Duo to Okta in phases based on roles or affiliations through March 2026. Learn more about getting started with Okta. Duo two-step verification will continue to provide an extra layer of security when accessing a limited number of services that are not HarvardKey-protected (e.g., SPH VDI, HKS KNet). These instructions are for anyone who can't reliably use a smartphone or landline to authenticate two-step verification. Instead, you can use a hardware token, a small device that plugs into your computer to complete two-factor verification with the touch of a button. Tokens do not work with mobile devices—they can only be used to authenticate when signing in on a computer with either a USB-A or USB-C ports commonly found on desktop or laptop computers. Request a hardware token Each hardware token is exclusive to a user and can't be assigned to more than one HarvardKey account. To request a token, submit a ticket with the subject line ""Request a hardware token."" They may also be available for pickup at your local IT support desk. Two-step verification must already be activated on your HarvardKey account with another device for a token to be added. If you haven't done so yet, follow these instructions to activate two-step verification. Authenticate to HarvardKey with a hardware token Once you receive your token, insert it into an open USB port on your computer with the metal ""Y"" face up. For Windows users, your computer will recognize the device and automatically install the necessary software. When complete, a pop-up balloon will indicate the device is ready to use. For Mac OS users, the first time you insert a hardware token, your computer will recognize it as a USB keyboard. Simply close the pop-up window to continue. Visit any HarvardKey-protected website or application, like the Canvas, Harvard internal directory, or connections.harvard.edu. Provide your HarvardKey username and password. When prompted for two-step verification, click Enter a Passcode Tap the metal ""Y"" on your token and you will be signed-in Still need help? If you're having trouble using a hardware token to authenticate, submit a ticket or call 617-495-7777."

Accounts and Authentication,What should I do if I receive an unexpected request from Duo two-step verification,"Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. HarvardKey two-step authentication requests are sent by Duo push notification to your mobile device, or by text message or phone call when you attempt to log in to a university resource using HarvardKey. Never approve a Duo authentication request if you are not actively attempting to log into a university resource. A fraudulent push notification may indicate an attempt at account compromise by a third party with knowledge of your HarvardKey credentials. If you receive a Duo request that is unexpected, first “Deny” the request. When you select “Deny” you prevent the authentication request from being completed. Once you “Deny” the request, please report it by selecting “It seems fraudulent” from the list of reporting options. Suspected fraud reports are investigated by Information Security. If for any reason you ""Deny"" a Duo request that your own log in activity triggered, select the “It was a mistake” reporting option. If you accidentally approve a Duo authentication request that was unexpected, please report this to the HUIT Service Desk as soon as possible by phoning 617-495-7777 so that the activity may be investigated by Information Security.

Accounts and Authentication,Duo two-step verifcation restricted in international locations,"Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. Description When accessing HarvardKey login from some international locations, the Duo two-step prompt may not display which prevents completing the login process. An error message may be displayed “Access denied. Duo Security does not provide services in your current location” in the Duo Prompt. Web traffic to some sites is blocked by the internet service providers in some countries as well as compliance with trade sanctions. This is preventing the Duo prompt from displaying and completing the login process. The type of second factor device used (phone, text, token, passcode, etc.) is irrelevant. Environment Web login to HarvardKey or other services that include the Duo two-step verification prompt which are under U.S. export controls and sanctions. Locations include: Cuba North Korea Iran Sudan Syria Crimea region Sevastopol region Donetsk region Luhansk region Additionally some countries may restrict access to internet services such as China and Russia.

Accounts and Authentication,Push notifications for Duo two-step verification aren't working,"Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. These troubleshooting steps are for users who don't receive notifications for two-step verification when signing in to HarvardKey. Resolution Not seeing Duo notifications can be the result of network connection issues. If you're moving between buildings on Harvard's campus, many phones have trouble determining whether to use the WiFi or cellular data when Duo checks for push requests. You can troubleshoot this problem by doing the following: Turn your phone to ""airplane mode"" and then back to regular operating mode again, or turning off your device's wi-fi connection and forcing it to use its cellular data connection. Check the time and date on your phone and make sure they are correct. If your date and time are manually set, try changing your device's configuration to automatically sync date/time with the network. Log in to the HarvardKey self-service page with a passcode generated by the Duo Mobile app and then send a new activation link to your phone. You can do this under ""Manage Two-step Verification"" in the ""Manage Your HarvardKey Account & Services"" section of the page. Still need help?

Accounts,Prepare to leave Harvard University,"This page summarizes what happens to your online access once you leave Harvard University/your role becomes inactive. It also details when these access changes take effect. Access depends on your active affiliations - it is derived both from (1) your role (e.g. faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate) and also (2) your school or department. When you no longer have an active role your access will either end immediately, or it may continue for an extended period (known as a grace period). People can have more than one role at the same time. In that case, a status change that ends one of your roles will only affect access that is based on that role. For example, when a student graduates they will still have an active alumni role. That active role doesn't provide them the same access as when they were a student though. Another example would be a staff who retires. These role transitions affect access. Please note the following information does not apply to affiliations for roles at Harvard Business School. If you have a role associated with HBS, please ask the school's IT service desk what to do with your files and accounts when you leave the University and to confirm with them when your access to Harvard resources and services will end.

Here is some basic guidance to get you started with retaining your records and data, plus specific recommendations for each file type. General record recommendations Talk to co-workers and supervisors about the records you control that they may need access to after you leave Consult an approved Harvard records schedule like the General Records Schedule to determine whether they should be: Destroyed Sent to the Archives Passed on to a colleague These will be records which for some reason should not yet be destroyed or sent to the Archives You may have records going to multiple colleagues Note that retention and disposition (destruction or archives transfer) rules apply to paper, email, and electronic records. In addition to checking your own personal storage spaces (desk drawers, personal file cabinets and server space), be sure to check shared spaces, too. This is important where you are the primary custodian of groups of records in shared spaces (public file cabinets, group server space). Paper records Destroying paper records Shred them, either on-site or through a Records Management Services (RMS) destruction event Passing to a colleague Transfer them to the most appropriate colleague. Make sure that they are adequately labeled. Sending to the Archives Consult the RMS web site and/or contact RMS for instructions on sending paper records to the Archives Email Destroy emails and attachments Depending on the application, empty the trash or purge deleted messages Pass to a colleague In order to keep attachments connected to messages, this will likely require IT assistance Send to Harvard Archives Contact Records Management Services (RMS) to discuss the transfer of these records. IT will likely need to be involved Attachments must remain connected The particular email format must be acceptable to the Archives An appropriate transfer mechanism must be determined. For example, copying to a DVD might violate Harvard security policies Other Electronic Records Backing Up Personal and Departmental Files To learn how to backup your files from Microsoft 365, Dropbox and Google, please see this knowledge article. Qualtrics survey data When you leave Harvard, you will no longer be able to access your surveys or survey data through your Harvard Qualtrics account. Learn more about what happens to your Qualtrics survey data. Poll Everywhere data When you leave Harvard, you will no longer be able to access your Poll Everywhere data with your Harvard Key. If you wish to retain your data, please submit a ticket with Poll Everywhere Support Canvas When you leave Harvard, you will continue to have access to your Canvas sites via your HarvardKey, but course sites may be concluded and then your access will be limited. If you are a teaching staff member and would like to reuse your content at another institution, or have a copy for your own records, we suggest you export your course content before you leave. If you are a student and would like a copy of your assignment submissions, you may download assignment submissions from all of your courses as a single zip file. Adobe Creative Cloud Assets Prior to deactivation of your Harvard Adobe License, you may migrate assets stored in the Adobe Creative Cloud to a personal account that you can take with you. Details involved in this process can be found here: https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/migrate-student-assets.ug.html Please be sure to read the information before performing your migration so that you understand what will and will not be migrated. Be sure to read the FAQ at the bottom of the page as well. Some Important things to know about the migration process: Not all data qualifies for automatic migration. Some assets may need to be downloaded, moved, or re-created manually. The Personal Adobe account you create must be a new one with an email address that is not already attached to an Adobe ID. Free Adobe Personal accounts include 2GB of storage. The University licenses include 100GB of storage. If you have more than 2GB in your University Adobe account, ALL of your qualifying data will be migrated to the new account, but you will not be able to upload additional data to your new account until you either purchase more storage space or remove enough files to be under the 2GB limitation. To start your Asset migration for graduating students, please go to the following link: https://graduation.adobe.com/ Zoom Assets If you have any recurring meetings, please ask a colleague to create a new meeting series to replace yours, as it will end when your account closes. You can download any recordings you have prior to your last day: https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0067567#h_01F4F8Z2FJCCE6KVBPGHNZEXSC Other electronic records Destroy electronic records Delete the records Empty the recycle bin or trash Pass to a colleague Notify the colleague, with adequate description, of any records that are in shared spaces. Transfer records in personal space to the colleague. This might be done in several ways Transfer via removable media (DVD, thumb drive). Depending on the confidentiality of the records, this might violate Harvard security policies. Coordinate with the colleague to temporarily move the records through shared server space. Be careful, though. Depending on the confidentiality of the records, this might not be a good idea. Consult Information Security to find out more. Have your local IT team move the files directly from your personal server space to your colleague's server space. 1Password Shared vaults Shared vault managers must remove accounts that no longer require access to departmental vaults. Deleted business accounts will be automatically deprovisioned. Family members After the Harvard affiliate's role ends family member(s) will be prompted to enter in a credit card to continue 1Password access. If no payment method is provided, the family accounts go into a read-only mode and cannot be updated. Because the family accounts go into read-only mode, there should be no disruption of service. Student accounts A code will be provided to extend account for 4.25 years after graduation. After the code expires, users will be prompted to enter in a credit card to continue 1Password access."

Next Steps Activate multifactor authentication Many applications require multifactor authentication. Activate multifactor authentication with HarvardKey to make sure you can access all the Harvard resources you need. If you're an alumni, you aren't required to do this. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of security designed to ensure that you’re the only person who can access your account. It requires that you verify your identity using multiple types of information, such as something you know (a password), something you have (a registered phone or hardware token) or something you are (your face or fingerprint). Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Learn more about the phased rollout of this technology. Update Stored Passwords To avoid being locked out of your account, update any applications where you have your password stored, such as password managers like 1Password, LastPass or Apple Keychain. This also includes standalone apps (particularly mobile apps) for services like Google Drive or Office 365. You will also need to update your password on mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail on your tablet, phone and computer. Need help?

HarvardKey,Set up a 1Password passkey for use with Okta,"Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. These instructions are for HarvardKey users who want to set up a passkey through a password manager on their computer for multifactor authentication (MFA), which provides an extra layer of security for accounts. 1Password is the recommended password manager for Harvard, and is available to faculty, staff, and students. Passkeys as a security method are a good option when: Your device does not support Okta Verify and you want to use an enhanced login option that does not require a password. You want to use an enhanced login method on a device where you are not the primary user (e.g. library or computer lab machines). You are traveling to a high-risk country. You would like a highly secure backup method in case you experience issues with your primary device. Set up a passkey with 1Password Prior to setting up a passkey, ensure 1Password is ready: Set up your 1Password account, if you have not already done so Add the 1Password browser extension to your browser Turn off your browser’s built in password manager Go to your Okta account settings (login.harvard.edu). Log in with your HarvardKey credentials. Click Manage security methods. Click the set up or set up another button beside the security key or biometric authenticator. Okta will prompt you to authenticate with the security method you last used. Click Set up on the “Set up security methods” prompt, under “Security Key or Biometric Authenticator.” Click Set up, on the “Set up security key or biometric authenticator” prompt. Click Save on the 1Password prompt to Save passkey. The passkey is now saved and will appear as a “Security Key or Biometric Authenticator” on your Okta Dashboard and in 1Password. Using a passkey on a browser with the 1Password extension After successfully setting up your passkey with 1Password for Okta, you can select the passkey as a security method the next time you log into a HarvardKey-protected resource. Sign in with your HarvardKey username. Select Security Key or Biometric Authenticator. Click Sign in on the 1Password pop-up window. Sign in on another device with a passkey If you have 1Password installed on your mobile device you can sign in with your passkey even on devices without 1Password. This is useful when using a computer that is not your primary device, including library, lab or shared computers. To use this method ensure that 1Password is installed and configured on your mobile device (1Password is available for Android and iOS). Sign in with your HarvardKey username. Select Security Key or Biometric Authenticator as your security method. Select Use a phone, tablet, or security key (Chrome) or iPhone, iPad, or Android device (Firefox and Safari). A QR code will be displayed. Scan this code with your mobile device’s camera. Choose 1Password, then follow the steps to sign in. Alternatives to 1Password 1Password is the recommended password manager for those eligible for an account through Harvard. Other options, including Apple Passwords and Google Password Manager, also provide strong security and the ability to synchronize passkeys across devices. Setup and use should be similar to the 1Password process above."
HarvardKey,Duo to Okta transition: FAQ,"Harvard University is replacing Duo with Okta for identity verification when signing into HarvardKey-protected tools and resources. Okta offers enhanced authentication methods that allow you to verify your identity with your fingerprint, facial recognition, or device-specific PIN instead of entering your HarvardKey password. This keeps your account more secure and makes sign-in faster and easier. Okta also supports several alternative authentication methods for occasions when enhanced authentication is not possible or preferred. When is this happening? The transition from Duo to Okta is happening in phases between spring 2025 and spring 2026, based on roles or affiliations. You will be contacted by HUIT or your School’s local IT support when it’s time for you to make the switch. If you want to set up Okta sooner, you can do so at your convenience by following these step-by-step instructions. Do I have to switch to Okta? Yes, eventually. By spring 2026, all HarvardKey users will be required to have set up Okta to continue accessing HarvardKey-protected tools and resources. What do I need to do? Recommended: For the fastest, most secure sign-in experience, we strongly recommend setting up Okta Verify with FastPass enabled on all your devices that you use to access HarvardKey-protected apps and services. Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up Okta Verify with FastPass. Alternative: You can also set up Okta using alternative authentication methods such as hardware tokens, passkeys, or traditional multifactor authentication. Learn more about alternative authentication methods. What is Okta FastPass? At Harvard, we’ve used traditional multifactor (or “two-step”) authentication methods such as push notifications, phone calls, or SMS messages to verify your identity when signing into HarvardKey. Although these reduce the risk of your account being compromised, they still rely on entering a password, which can be stolen, guessed, or phished. With Okta Verify’s FastPass feature, you can verify your identity using your device’s built-in security mechanism (e.g., Touch ID, FaceID, PIN, Windows Hello) instead of entering your HarvardKey password. Sometimes known as “passwordless” authentication, this improves security and makes sign-in faster. You can use FastPass with: Your fingerprint or facial recognition (also known as “biometrics”) using your device’s built-in fingerprint or face authenticators (e.g. Windows Hello, Touch ID, Face ID). Because biometrics are unique to you and stored securely on your device, they are harder to steal, replicate, or hack compared to passwords, which can be guessed or shared. A device-specific PIN or passcode that is encrypted and tied exclusively to your device. Unlike a password, which works on any internet-connected device, this PIN only grants access on the device where it was set up. Even if stolen, a device-specific PIN is useless without physical access to your device. What are the other benefits of Okta FastPass? In addition to significantly improving security, FastPass makes signing in to HarvardKey faster and easier. Since you verify your identity directly on your device, there's no need to enter a password, wait for a push notification, or use a second device like your phone when signing in on your computer. Is my biometric data secure and private?  Yes. Your biometric data (face or fingerprint) is encrypted and stored only on your device—it is never shared with, nor can it be accessed by, Harvard or Okta. It is used solely to unlock access to HarvardKey. If you prefer not to use biometrics, you can opt for a device-specific PIN instead. What if I don’t have my devices with me? If you need to access a HarvardKey-protected tool or resource, but you don’t have access to any of your devices that have Okta set up, you can contact the HUIT Service Desk for help. Are there alternative authentication methods? Yes. If your device doesn’t support Okta Verify or you’re using a shared/public device, you may need to use an alternative authentication method, like a passkey or hardware token. You may also decide to set up an alternative authentication method as a backup. I currently use a YubiKey with Duo. Can I continue to use a YubiKey with Okta? Yes, you can continue to use a YubiKey with Okta. We may need to upgrade your YubiKey to meet Okta security requirements.  Can I still use traditional multifactor authentication? Yes. While we highly recommend setting up enhanced authentication, you can still verify your identity through Okta using a push notification or a unique six-digit one-time code. Okta does not support the use of SMS or phone calls as these are considered less secure verification methods. Learn more about multifactor authentication options. Where can I get help? We understand this is a big change, and we’re here to help. If you need help during the setup process or have questions about authentication methods, contact the HUIT Service Desk or your local IT support.

HarvardKey,"Set up a hardware token (e.g., YubiKey) for use with Okta","Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. These instructions are for HarvardKey users who want to set up a hardware token, such as a YubiKey, for Okta passwordless or multifactor authentication (MFA), to provide an extra layer of security for accounts. A hardware token is a small, key-like device you plug into your computer to verify your identity. The most common hardware token used at Harvard is a YubiKey. YubiKeys with fingerprint sensors or that require a PIN, can be used for passwordless or multifactor authentication. YubiKeys that require a one-time passcode can be used for MFA only. Learn more about hardware tokens here - What Is a Security Token (or Authentication Token) and How Does It Work?. Hardware tokens as a security method are a good option when: Your device does not support passwordless options with Okta Verify and you want to use passwordless authentication.

Administrative Systems,Getting or reactivating your HUID to log in to Research Administration Systems,"DESCRIPTION To have a profile and log in to the following Research Administration Systems, a person must have an active HUID and HarvardKey. Grants Management Application Suite (GMAS) Electronic Submission Tracking & Reporting for Institutional Review Boards (ESTR-IRB) Agreements for Data Use Agreements (DUAs) Data Safety Outside Activity and Interest Reporting (OAIR) If a person does not have a Harvard affiliation as faculty, student or staff; or if their affiliation is otherwise no longer active, they can request a new HUID or reactivation of their previous HUID via the Harvard Sponsored Role process. Note: Individuals who once had an active HUID or who have only received a HUID from a Harvard Library may see an error page when attempting to log in to the above noted applications. This is a good indicator that a new HUID or reactivation is needed for successful log in. Before proceeding with the Harvard Sponsored Role process under the policy to obtain a HUID (or reactivated HUID), check in with the relevant research team, reviewing office or in the case of OAIR, the relevant Harvard sponsored programs office to confirm review requirements before requesting a HUID and HarvardKey. STEP-BY-STEP Guide To request a new HUID or reactivate a previous HUID: The person who needs an active HUID should connect with appropriate sponsor to complete the role request (see procedures outlined in the policy) Complete all sections of the form. Include all required details as appropriate to the person's role at the University and when completing the form, also note the following items: Email: The form must have a valid active email address Previous HUID: If available, so it may be reactivated Role Type: Should be appropriate to the role under the policy. Harvard Identity and Access Management has a portfolio of many role types. The above-noted research administration and compliance systems allow access and person profile selection for ONLY the following roles. Academic Advisor Consultant Contingent Worker External Administrative Affiliate External Core Customer Field Education Supervisor Hospital Administrator Incoming Employee/Transfer Interschool Affiliate Research Collaborator Security Smithsonian Astrophysics Affiliate Vendor Volunteer The person named as authorizer/sponsor must submit the completed form. After the form is submitted, it takes about three days for ESTR-IRB, Agreements-DUA, Data Safety, and OAIR to update access. After the HUID (or notice of reactivation) is received, the person with the new role / HUID reactivation must claim a HarvardKey (if not already claimed) to log in to the above-noted applications."

In the Deposit Type field, it will default to ""Remaining Balance"" account and you will not be able to specify an about or percent. If you already have a ""Remaining Balance"" account, you can select either Amount or Percent from the dropdown. Note: Harvard requires one account to be designated as “Remaining Balance”. The “Remaining Balance” account will be last in priority and will be where the remainder of your net pay will be deposited once all other deposits have been made. If this is the first direct deposit entry being made, a warning message will be issued stating this and will designate this first entry as the “Remaining Balance” account. If you are entering more than one account and this is not the one you want designated this way, click on the Cancel button and enter the account you want as “Remaining Balance” first. Then add additional accounts. If you wish to change which of your account is the “Remaining Balance” account, you will need to contact University Financial Services for assistance at (617) 495-8500, option 4. Click on the Save button when you are done. By clicking on Save, you are submitting these entries to the database and will need to use the edit functionality to subsequently change any of the information. Once you have saved, the deposit order will be assigned according to the order in which the accounts were entered. Steps - Reorder Accounts (if you have more than one account) Click Reorder Order of your accounts by dragging and dropping the row with the = icon on the Reorder column to the desired position. The top, highest row (“1”) indicates that funds will be deposited in that account before any others. This applies to all but the “Remaining Balance” account, which will always be last. Click Save. Note: When you add or change direct deposit account, a “test transfer” or pre-note will be made to the financial institution to ensure that all direct deposit information is correct. Pre-notes may cause a delay in your direct deposit by one or two pay periods. During this time, you will receive a physical check. Questions For any questions or issues, please log a ticket with the Central Payroll team by emailing ufs_crt@harvard.edu."

To request access for yourself to view all Agreements-DUA, ESTR-IRB, and Data Safety submissions associated with a certain department or school, submit a request via the Service Now form. Viewer permissions are shared between the Agreements-DUA, ESTR-IRB, and Data Safety systems; you do not need to submit separate access requests for each system. The request will be routed to the appropriate approver before access is granted. The form will ask you to specify which school or department(s) you need to access. NOTES: You may only submit this form to request access for yourself. If you need to request access for multiple schools, you will need to submit one form per school. Department or School Level Viewer Access does not include access to OAIR submissions. It is not possible to have viewer access to OAIR submissions. How to Request Submitting/Negotiating (DUA) Office Team Member Access A person indicated as a DUA reviewer in a submitting/negotiating office team in the system can manage the review of any submissions across the University. To be added as a DUA reviewer, send a request via email to estrhelp@harvard.edu OR duahelp@harvard.edu or ask a member of the office leadership to make a request on your behalf. NOTE: For this level of access, the requestor must be office leadership. How to Request IRB Office Team Member Access A person indicated as an IRB director or IRB coordinator in the system can manage the review of any IRB submissions across the University. Note that within this subset is the IRB Committee member role, which is added/managed in the same way. To be added as an IRB office team member, send a request via email to estrhelp@harvard.edu OR duahelp@harvard.edu or ask a member of the office leadership to make a request on your behalf. NOTE: For this level of access, the requestor must be office leadership. How to Request Data Safety Reviewer Access A person indicated as a data safety reviewer (referred to as a ""Specialist"" in the system) can manage the review of any Data Safety submissions across the University. To be added as an data safety reviewer, send a request via email to rshelp@harvard.edu. NOTE: For this level of access, the request will be validated by help desk team members before access is granted. How to Request OAIR Reviewer Access A person indicated as an OAIR reviewer (referred to as a ""COI Administrator"" in the system) can manage the review of any OAIR submissions for people affiliated with the schools/units that the reviewer is assigned to. To be added as an OAIR reviewer, send a request via email to oairhelp@harvard.edu. NOTE: For this level of access, the request will be validated by help desk team members before access is granted. How to Request Access for Ancillary Reviews An ancillary reviewer can be a person or group assigned to review an IRB, DUA, or Data Safety submission and provide consultation, feedback, or decision/approval. An ancillary reviewer has read-only access to IRB, DUA, or Data Safety submissions in certain states of review. Access for individuals and groups are handled differently. For Individual Access: The individual conducting the review of the submission (in the submitting/negotiating office or IRB office, or the data safety specialist) will manage/select ancillary reviewers on a submission. Contact the submitting/negotiating office for per-record access or if your review should be part of the standard process. For Group Access: To be added to a group that is assigned ancillary reviews, send a request via email to estrhelp@harvard.edu, duahelp@harvard.edu, OR rshelp@harvard.edu. For example, if you are part of the HUIT Security Review group and need access to submissions assigned to that group for review, you will need to request to be added to that group. Need help?

Administrative Systems,GMAS FAQ:  I'm new to Harvard. Why can't I access GMAS?,"QUESTION: I'm new to Harvard. Why can't I access GMAS? ANSWER: In order to access GMAS, you must first be given security. Security can be given in a few different ways. 1.You are added to a project as a PI/Mentor, or as an interfaculty involvement PI or interfaculty involvement department administrator. This will allow you to log into GMAS and grant you access to any project where you play the PI or Mentor role. 2.You are added to a segment administrative team. This will allow you to log into GMAS and grant you access to any project where you have been added to an administrative team. The action you can perform on the project will be determined based on the role you were added to on the administrative team. 3.You are added to a standing team. This will allow you to log into GMAS and grant you access to all projects that fit the scope of the standing team you belong to (this could be by ORG, or by ORG and PI). For more information on how security works, and who can help you with security, visit the ""GMAS Security Deconstructed"" job aid. If your profile is not yet showing in GMAS, and this is preventing you from being given GMAS security through any of the methods above, it is likely due to a timing issue. There are a few systems through which a person’s information needs to flow, before it can make its way into GMAS. When an employee first starts, their manager and local HR representative assist the individual to ensure they receive a HUID and are placed on payroll. Part of this process is being set up in the Identity Management system (IDM). Once a person is in the IDM system, their information is sent to PeopleSoft and GMAS. Data flows from IDM, to PeopleSoft, then to GMAS. This means that it will take at least two days from the time an individual is added to IDM to be added to GMAS. If the individual is added to IDM after noon, it can take up to three days for the individual to be added to GMAS. GMAS allows access and person profile selection for ONLY the following roles that do not fit the above definitions: Academic Advisor Consultant Contingent Worker External Administrative Affiliate External Core Customer Field Education Supervisor Hospital Administrator Incoming Employee/Transfer Interschool Affiliate Research Collaborator Security Smithsonian Astrophysics Affiliate Vendor Volunteer"
Administrative Systems,Receiving an error message when trying to sign the Participation Agreement,"There are 2 reasons why an error message will appear when trying to access the Participation Agreement link: (1) an incorrect link was provided (2) there’s an issue related to the individual's start date. 1. An incorrect link was provided: In this case, someone sends a link for the Request or Person Profile page in GMAS (where GMAS users can easily access the Participation Agreement), instead of the link to the Participation Agreement (where non-GMAS users can easily access the Participation Agreement). The GMAS links can only be accessed by individuals who have appropriate security to get into GMAS. Most of the time, the people who need to sign don't have the proper security to access GMAS and therefore receive a security error message. The proper link to sign the Participation Agreement is https://gmas.harvard.edu/gmas/participationagreement. For more information about the Participation Agreement, you can visit the Office of the Vice Provost for Research website. Information about the Harvard University Participation Agreement can be found under the Intellectual Property Policy. The correct link to the Participation Agreement can also be found there. It is not required that an individual have GMAS security to sign the Participation Agreement. Anyone with a HUID should be able to sign using the correct link. 2. There’s an issue related to individual’s start date: If the individual who needs to sign falls into one of the following categories, it would cause an error when trying to link to the Participation Agreement: They have a start date that is three business days or less in the past They have a start date that is in the future They were set-up in advance of their start date with a Person of Interest role which does not feed into GMAS Transfer of person information can take a few days to pass between systems. Usually, a person’s information will make its way into GMAS three business days after their official start date. At this time, they should be able to sign the Participation Agreement. The proper link to the Participation Agreement is https://gmas.harvard.edu/gmas/participationagreement. If an individual needs to sign the Participation Agreement before their start date, they will need to be set up in the Identity Management System (IDM/MIDAS) in a role that GMAS receives. GMAS allows access and person profile selection for ONLY the following roles: Academic Advisor Consultant Contingent Worker External Administrative Affiliate External Core Customer Field Education Supervisor Hospital Administrator Incoming Employee/Transfer Interschool Affiliate Research Collaborator Security Smithsonian Astrophysics Affiliate Vendor Volunteer If you are receiving an error message when trying to sign the Participation Agreement, and none of the issues above apply, please email us at contactgmas@harvard.edu."

Administrative Systems,HART FAQ: Saved Customizations on Transaction LIsting Dashboard Not Working,"QUESTION: HART FAQ: Saved Customizations on Transaction Listing Dashboard Not Working ANSWER: This knowledge article discusses saved customizations not working on the Transaction Listing dashboards in the Harvard Analytics and Reporting Tool (HART) powered by OBI (Oracle Business Intelligence). These are the resources for HART that can be used for the financial dashboards, grant management dashboards, procure-to-pay dashboards, CAPS dashboards, Chart of Accounts dashboards, Cash Management dashboards, User Security Dashboards, Accounts Receivable dashboards and CSMA dashboards. Student dashboards and Student Financial dashboards are NOT covered here-search my.harvard for these dashboards. Migrated Customizations on the Transaction Listing Dashboards DMS has migrated all existing customizations for all dashboards into the upgraded version of HART, which will be implemented on May 20, 2019. An issue has come up concerning the Transaction Listing Dashboards: When the user applies a saved customization on any Transaction Listing dashboard, two things may happen: A % sign will appear in the Consolidated Flag prompt (this will usually happen) A number may appear in the User Role Choice prompt (this is inconsistent) This is only happening on the Transaction Listing dashboards. In addition, this only impacts migrated customizations on these dashboards. New customizations created in the upgraded HART will NOT have this problem. Applying a Migrated Customization to a Transaction Listing Dashboard After accessing your Transaction Listing dashboard, select the Page Options menu under your HUID in the top right corner, then select Apply Saved Customization. A list of saved customizations will appear: 2. Click on the Customization. In this example, the user is seeing both issues: a number appears in the User Role Choice prompt and a % sign appears in the Consolidating Flag prompt: If Only the % Sign Appears If only the % sign in the Consolidating Flag prompt appears, the customization may run without problems. The % sign is the equivalent to the (All Column Values) that usually appears in this prompt. In some cases, the dashboard will not run. If that is the case: Confirm your User Role and select the first Apply button on the dashboard. If that still does not work, Select the second Apply button on the dashboard. Once the dashboard runs, the customization will begin to work normally, and you will not need to do this again. Re-Saving the Customization with Revised Prompts If you wish to make a change to the existing customization with updated prompts, you will need to change the % sign in the Consolidating Flag prompt to (All Column Values), and then re-save the customization with the same name. See steps 3 onward in the next section for instructions on how to re-save a customization. If both the % Sign and the Number in the User Role Choice Prompt Appears If both the % sign in the Consolidating Flag prompt appears and the User Role Choice prompt contains a number, the dashboard will NOT run You will need to fix the issues and re-save the customization. This is a one-time action and after the customization is re-saved, you will not encounter this issue again. To resolve this issue: Review your role in the User Role Choice prompt and confirm it is correct. If it is not, select the correct role from the drop-down. Even if you did not change your role, select the 1st Apply button. The dashboard should run. If the dashboard does not run, hit the 2nd Apply button.

Who can record? Does Zoom notify meeting participants about recordings? Where do the recordings go, and who can see them? How do Zoom’s transcript features work? How do I save a transcript/ Who can save a transcript? What is saved in a Zoom meeting transcript? Does Zoom notify meeting participants about transcripts? Where do the transcripts go, and who can see them? Should I record or save a transcript of my Zoom meeting? How do I secure my recording? Specific Use Cases Public events Nonpublic meetings Nonpublic speaking engagements Class sessions Non-Class Meetings Intended for Students Meetings of Faculty and Staff How do Zoom recordings work? Zoom’s push-button recording feature makes it easy to record any meeting hosted on the platform. The information below describes Zoom’s recording functionality as of the date of posting, but note that Zoom continues to introduce new product features. Who can record? The default setting for Harvard users allows only the Zoom meeting host to Zoom-record a meeting session, although the meeting host may authorize other meeting participants to record the meeting. We generally advise that meeting hosts not allow other participants to record a Zoom meeting. Does Zoom notify meeting participants about recordings? When a meeting host activates a Zoom recording, Zoom announces that “this meeting is being recorded.” If the host stops the recording, Zoom will announce that “the recording has stopped.” Any meeting participant who joins a meeting in progress will hear an announcement from Zoom that the meeting is being recorded. At all times when a meeting is being recorded, a button appears at the top left corner of the Zoom window: blinking . Where do the recordings go, and who can see them? When a meeting host activates recording, Zoom presents the host with two options:  and . If the host selects , Zoom creates recording files in multiple formats, including audio-only and a video recording. When the host ends the meeting, Zoom presents these several files to the host, who can then save them locally. If the host selects , Zoom prepares an audio recording, a video recording (showing only speakers), and an accompanying Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated audio transcript of the meeting. These files are available for the host only to access at a unique URL provided by Zoom for that meeting. The host may, in turn, share secondary unique URLs that will present the video recording, audio-only recording, or transcript to others. Note: unless additional steps are taken to secure the recording (see below: “How Do I Secure My Recording?”), any member of the public who accesses that URL can view the shared video recording. (The URLs are very long and would be difficult to guess.) The recording is therefore only private to the extent that the URL is not disclosed. How do Zoom’s transcript features work? How do I save a transcript/ Who can save a transcript? Zoom provides two ways to generate and save a transcript: (1) through its cloud recording function which, when turned on in Zoom’s settings, generates a transcript automatically after the meeting is over; and (2) through the self-service  setting in Zoom’s captioning functions, which allows captions to be generated by a captioning service, by meeting attendees, or automatically by artificial intelligence. If as host you record a Zoom meeting to the cloud, Zoom will provide three links at the URL where your cloud recording is posted: a link to a video recording of the meeting, a link to an audio recording of the meeting, and a link to a time-stamped transcript of the meeting. Only the host can access the URL, although the host may share a secondary URL that will cause the recipient to download the transcript file. (Note: recording to your computer will not generate a transcript.) Zoom also includes a captioning feature that, when switched on, allows meeting attendees to see speech-to-text transcriptions of spoken audio in real time, during the meeting. Zoom’s settings for captioning allow a meeting host to enable all meeting attendees to save transcripts of the captioning, at their option. A meeting host can choose to activate  to enable all of your meetings’ attendees — not just you, the host — to save transcripts of your meeting and do what they like with them. This functionality has important privacy implications, which we discuss below. What is saved in a Zoom meeting transcript? Zoom meetings can be captioned live in a meeting either manually by a person or by artificial intelligence. Human generated captioning requires a person to type what is spoken in real-time. The meeting host may designate another meeting participant to type the captions during a meeting or engage a 3rd party caption service to do this work. Zoom recently introduced a feature that will produce captions during the course of a meeting, using an AI (artificial intelligence) speech-to-text technology that analyzes audio files and generates text transcripts of what was spoken. The Zoom meeting transcript generated alongside the recording saved in the Zoom cloud includes text along with the name of the person speaking. A saved file from Zoom’s live captioning includes transcript text and time stamps, but no speaker names. Although live captioning identifies which meeting attendee said what, the saved transcript of the same meeting does not identify individual speakers. A transcript may nevertheless identify speakers in the rendered text (when speakers introduce themselves) and/or through context (when one speaker addresses a question to a second speaker by name, and the second speaker answers; or when one speaker attributes what was earlier said to another person). Does Zoom notify meeting participants about transcripts? Unlike with recordings, Zoom does not announce to participants that the meeting host will be generating a transcript of what meeting participants are communicating. If a host generates a transcript simply by recording to the cloud, the attendees will know the meeting is recorded but not necessarily that a transcript will be made available, too. If a host enables  via Zoom’s live captioning function, all meeting attendees will be able to see that they can save transcripts of the meeting. Where do the transcripts go, and who can see them? Transcripts made incident to recordings to the cloud are available for viewing at unique URLs provided by Zoom and accessible only to hosts, alongside the corresponding recordings. The host may share a link to the transcript file, but once the file is shared, it can be freely copied and distributed by the recipient. When  is enabled in Zoom live captioning, each individual meeting attendee may choose to save a transcript, and the transcript will be saved to the attendee’s computer. Should I record or save a transcript of my Zoom meeting? Exceptional reasons to record a Zoom meeting include: You intend to post a digital recording of the meeting online for a public or select audience to watch after the fact, or you expect that you will need to repurpose the meeting (for example, by making a live training session to one audience available to other audiences in a recorded format). You would have recorded the meeting anyway in the ordinary course if you were conducting it in person or by telephone. You expect that certain critical invitees will not be able to attend the meeting, and it would be insufficient (e.g., for accessibility reasons) simply to provide them with a slide deck, minutes, notes, or briefing of the meeting after the fact. You find during the meeting that one or more attendees are having Zoom connectivity problems, and it would be insufficient simply to provide them with a slide deck, minutes, notes, or briefing of the meeting after the fact. If none of these considerations applies to your meeting, then we advise as a general matter that you do not Zoom-record your meeting. Similar considerations apply to the generation of saved transcripts: unless you anticipate some need to access personally or communicate to third parties what was discussed in the meeting and it would be insufficient to refer to or provide a slide deck, minutes, notes, or a briefing of meeting, you should not save a transcript of the meeting. This is especially true of the self-service  setting in Zoom’s live captioning feature because each individual user will be able to generate and save transcripts entirely outside your control as host. Because the self-service  setting in live captioning is much less secure, you should not enable it unless you have a compelling reason why recourse to the cloud-recording transcript would not suffice for your purposes. It is strongly recommended that recordings are not substituted for agendas or meeting minutes. See the University’s General Records Schedule for further guidance on how to manage meeting records. How do I secure my recording? Although the shareable URL where a Zoom cloud recording is posted is not publicly listed or easy, necessarily, to guess, it remains the case that any person who gets hold of the URL may be able to watch the video. Accordingly, among other features it has adopted to protect the privacy of meeting participants, Zoom allows meeting hosts to password-protect video recordings of their meetings. If students appear and are personally identifiable in your meeting recording, you must password-protect the video. In fact, we strongly urge members of the Harvard community to apply password protection to all Zoom recordings, if they must make and store them on the Zoom cloud. In addition, you should not make it available for download or otherwise distribute a digital copy of the recording. If your Zoom meeting is a class session, you should post the link to the recording only within Canvas, and nowhere else. Last, you should delete Zoom recordings when you no longer have need of them. If you have exceptional need for longer term access to recordings and transcripts that do not include students, the preferred storage option is to use Harvard-licensed systems such as OneDrive, Sharepoint, DropBox, Panopto, Kaltura, or use shared network drives if absolutely necessary. Transcripts made incident to recordings to the cloud are available for viewing at unique URLs provided by Zoom and accessible only to hosts, alongside the corresponding recordings. The host may share a link to the transcript file, but once the file is shared, it can be freely copied and distributed by the recipient. For information about how to apply password protection and other ways to protect the privacy of persons who attend your Zoom meeting, visit this HUIT Knowledge Base document, which describes several Zoom privacy features. As noted above, the  setting in Zoom’s live captioning feature allows all of a meeting’s attendees to generate and save their own transcripts. If you activate this setting, you will not be able to secure any of the transcripts that the other attendees make and keep for themselves (and may easily distribute to others). Specific Use Cases Public events For these purposes, a “Public Event” is an event directed to a live public audience. If you intend to use Zoom to record a Public Event for any reason — for internal use, to post on a public-facing website, or anything in between, you should do the following: First, you must ensure that invited speakers, panelists, or presenters sign an appropriate speaker release form. You can find variations of this form for paid and unpaid engagements on the OGC website. Please contact Records Management Services for guidance on how to manage release forms and the University General Records Schedule for how to manage the recording and any transcripts over the long term. Second, as a best practice, you should take steps to allow audience members to access a live stream of the event without simultaneously projecting audio or video into the Zoom meeting. Zoom Webinars follows this model and includes features that support moderated Q&A sessions with audience members. You can also live stream a Zoom meeting through YouTube; audience members watch the event on YouTube and can comment and ask questions using YouTube’s live chat feature. Moderators can then monitor the chat and select questions to put to speakers in the Zoom session. In addition to reducing the risk of “Zoom-bombing” and other disruptions (intentional or unintentional) of your event, these methods eliminate the privacy considerations that arise from audience members appearing and speaking in the recorded session. Nonpublic meetings Different recording and privacy considerations apply to Zoom sessions not directed to a live public audience, depending on the nature and purpose of the session and the composition of the audience. We break out nonpublic Zoom sessions into categories below, but we first refer you to the considerations expressed above (“Should I Record My Zoom Meeting?”) to inform your decision whether or not to record. Nonpublic speaking engagements If you are hosting a lecture, panel discussion, seminar, or similar program in which speakers present to a select (i.e., nonpublic) audience of invitees, other than a class session (discussed below), we suggest that you follow the practices we recommend above for “Public Events,” which would keep audience members from appearing and speaking in the Zoom meeting. If, however, your program calls for direct interaction between speakers and members of the audience, you should do the following: First, you must ensure that invited speakers, panelists, or presenters sign an appropriate speaker release form. You can find variations of this form for paid and unpaid engagements on the OGC website. Please contact Records Management Services for guidance on how to manage release forms and the University General Records Schedule for how to manage the recording and any transcripts over the long term. Second, you should tell the audience: That you are recording the event and if you are recording to the cloud, saving a written transcript. How you plan to use the recording and/or transcript, including who will be able to see or hear them. That they have no obligation to appear or speak in the recording. That they can turn off video and participate under an alias if they choose. That if they choose to participate in an identifiable way, they are authorizing the use of the recording (and, if applicable, the transcript) as you have described it. Class sessions Recordings for Class Use Only. If your objective in recording a class session is simply to make an archived recording available to people who need it for the class—enrolled students and instructors and their supporting personnel—it is sufficient simply to provide notice (1) that you are recording the class and (2) for what purpose. If you want the same group of people to be able to review a written transcript of the session, you should record the class session to the cloud. This approach to generating transcripts is much more secure than switching on the self-service transcript generation setting in Zoom live captioning. When you make a class recording available using Zoom, you should use the cloud recording option and take steps to secure the recording as described above (“How Do I Secure My Recording?”). Recordings saved to the Zoom cloud include a transcript which when shared through a secured recording URL can be password protected. Note, sharing a link directly to the transcript does not have the option for password protection. Recording for Broader Audiences. If you have Zoom-recorded a class session for student access, and you subsequently have reason to make a class session recording more broadly available—i.e., to persons outside of the class—then student privacy considerations require, as a legal matter, that any students who appear and are personally identifiable in the video must provide written consent to that disclosure. This holds true as well in the case of saved written transcripts of the class if students are named in the transcript or are identifiable from context. The written consent should consist of a description of the disclosures you will make outside the class, including to whom, by what means, and for what purpose. It is sufficient if students simply respond “yes” to an email that includes these details and asks if they will consent to the disclosure. If prior to hosting a class session you anticipate that you will need to make a recording or transcript of some or all of the class available outside of the class, you should notify the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning. If you are unable to obtain the needed consent for disclosure of your recorded video or transcript outside of your class, and you need help removing appearances by personally identifiable students from the recording or transcript, you should contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning for technical assistance. If you have questions about the federal privacy law governing student records, you should contact the Office of the General Counsel. Non-Class Meetings Intended for Students This category includes Zoom meetings specifically directed at student audiences. Examples are Career Services Q&A sessions, office hours hosted by faculty, and meetings or other information sessions with faculty and administrators that would have been conducted in person or by phone, prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Generally speaking, we advise that you not record Zoom meetings for these purposes, unless one of the considerations that favor recording applies, as described above (“Should I Record My Zoom Meeting?”). If you do record the meeting, you must do the following: If the meeting is directed to a small number of students, you must: Tell the students that you are recording the event and, if you are recording to the cloud, saving a written transcript, and ask whether they consent to the recording. Unless all participating students consent to the recording, you should not record the Zoom session. Obtain written consent of all student participants in the meeting before disclosing the recording or transcript to any person who is not a Harvard employee with a legitimate educational interest in accessing the recording. If the meeting is directed to a large number of students—for example, a Career Services Q&A or a department-wide meeting—it may not be practical to elicit express written consent to subsequent use of the recording from all participating students. In that case, you must tell the students: That you are recording the event and/or, if applicable, saving a written transcript. How you plan to use the recording or transcript, including who will be able to see or hear them. That students have no obligation to appear or speak in the recording. That students can turn off video and participate under an alias if they choose. That if students choose to participate in an identifiable way, they are consenting to the disclosure of the recording or transcript as you have described it. Even if you take all of the above precautions, there may be cases in which it is nevertheless inappropriate or unlawful to disclose the video recording or transcript to third parties. Accordingly, if any student appears and is personally identifiable in your Zoom recording, you should contact the Office of the General Counsel before disclosing the recording to any person who is not a Harvard employee with a legitimate educational interest in accessing the recording. When you make a meeting recording available using Zoom, you should use the cloud recording option and take steps to secure the recording as described above (“How Do I Secure My Recording?”). Recordings saved to the Zoom cloud include a transcript which when shared through a secured recording URL can be password protected. Note, sharing a link directly to the transcript does not have the option for password protection. Meetings of Faculty and Staff Faculty meetings should not be recorded, nor should you use Zoom to save a written transcript or enable Zoom’s self-service  setting. In the case of staff meetings, we advise that you not record Zoom staff meetings or enable self-service  unless one of the considerations that favor recording applies, as described above (“Should I Record My Zoom Meeting?”). If you decide to record a staff meeting, the resulting recording or transcript should not be made available to anyone who was not invited to the meeting. If you feel you need to show the recording or transcript to any person who was not invited to the meeting, you should first consult with your local HR dean or director. It is strongly recommended that recordings are not substituted for agendas or meeting minutes. See the University’s General Records Schedule for further guidance on how to manage meeting records. If you make a meeting recording available using Zoom, you should use the cloud recording option and take steps to secure the recording as described above (“How Do I Secure My Recording?”). Recordings saved to the Zoom cloud include a transcript which when shared through a secured recording URL can be password protected. Note, sharing a link directly to the transcript does not have the option for password protection."

Harvard stakeholders (guests) who do business with Harvard faculty and staff that have the need to send or receive files securely are able to do so using the Accellion Kiteworks tool. The Harvard stakeholder (guest) is required to setup a Kiteworks Guest Account. This guest account is valid for 30 consecutive days after last use. The 30 day expiration will reset after each use, but will expire automatically if not used within those 30 days. If a guest account expires, a new account can be setup using the same login email address and a new password, if required for future use.

Individuals with a Harvard Sponsored Role and a HarvardKey in a Harvard email domain are able to utilize their HarvardKey credentials to sign into Kiteworks and use the tool. To initiate the creation of an account, a Harvard faculty or staff member must first send an email or file transfer to you as the stakeholder (guest) from their Kiteworks account. If you have not received an email from your sponsoring Harvard faculty or staff member, contact them by email or phone to do so. When a stakeholder (guest) receives the email in their email account, they should click the Access Message hyperlink at the bottom of the email message.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",How to manage your existing consumer Dropbox data when  requesting a new Harvard Dropbox,"This article is for those requesting a new Harvard Dropbox account who may already have a consumer Dropbox. If you already have a consumer Dropbox account and you want to use Harvard Dropbox, you’ll have to decide between three ways of relating the accounts to one another. A summary of the options follow with the table below providing further detail. Please note: If you would like a prorated refund from Dropbox on unused service, you must choose Option 3, “Merge your accounts.” HUIT's Dropbox Service default's to 1 TB of storage per user. Additional storage may be provided upon special request. If you are collaborating on more than 1TB of data, please request a Dropbox Team Folder after your Harvard Dropbox account has been created. Option 1: Connect your accounts: If you choose this option, your consumer account will remain separate from your Harvard account, and each of your devices can sync with one or both of your accounts. This is the recommended option for most users of Harvard University Dropbox. Note: Dropbox on Linux does not yet support connected accounts. Option 2: Don’t connect your accounts: If you choose this option, your consumer account will remain separate from your Harvard account, but each of your devices can only sync with one of your accounts. This is not a recommended option. Option 3: Merge your accounts: If you choose this option, the files from your consumer account will be transferred to your Harvard University account. This is not a recommended option, with the exception of two cases: You want to close your paid consumer account and get a prorated refund from Dropbox for unused service. Your existing consumer account is only used for work data. To get started, follow the instructions below: Options 1 & 2: To keep your consumer account separate from your Harvard Dropbox account.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",How do I Sync Dropbox files to my local devices?,"This article is for users trying to sync their Dropbox files to their local device. How to Sync Dropbox files to a local device Follow these steps on Dropbox's website to install the Dropbox Sync Client. What happens if my hard drive doesn't have enough space to sync all of my files? When you save a file to Dropbox, it syncs with all of the devices you've connected with your Dropbox account. This means that it takes up space on each computer hard drive. This can create problems if your hard drive doesn't have enough available space to sync everything in your Dropbox folder. Harvard Dropbox users have two ways to help manage what files sync to your desktop application. We recommend the use of these features to prevent using up too much disk space on local devices or even reaching the storage limit on local drives. Selective sync. Selective sync helps you choose which files appear in your file explorer, and which are only available in the cloud at dropbox.com. Click here to get started with Selective sync. Smart Sync. Smart Sync shows you all of your content in your file explorer, but only downloads the ones that you want to access locally. Click here to get started with Smart Sync.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Information for new SharePoint owners and administrators,"These instructions are for faculty, students, and staff that have created and are owners of a SharePoint site. Welcome to SharePoint! You recently created a new SharePoint site. SharePoint is a robust platform that fosters communication and collaboration, internally and externally. As a Site Owner, you are also the Site Administrator and are responsible for the following actions: Creating and maintaining user permissions Sharing your Files and Folders Ensuring there are always at least 2 Site owners Customizing your Site pages Create and Maintain User Permissions There are three ways to grant permissions to your new SharePoint site: You can add members to the associated Office 365 Group and they will have access to all content on your SharePoint site including the associated Email & Calendar, Microsoft Planner, and Microsoft Team. The easiest way to manage SharePoint site permissions is to allow all members to access all shared information. If you your SharePoint site requires granular permissions (i.e. restricted folders), you may grant permissions through SharePoint groups. If you need to allow access to a target group, you can grant access to a dynamic Grouper group. For more information regarding requesting and setting Grouper dynamic groups on SharePoint sites, visit the following knowledge base article: Grant SharePoint access to a dynamic group. Add users to the Office 365 Group Open SharePoint Site. In upper right corner, click on Members. Select Add members. Type the name or email address for the member you wish to add. Click Save. Permissions through SharePoint Groups It is important to understand how to apply SharePoint permissions properly so that sensitive information is not exposed to unintended people. To learn about managing permissions for your SharePoint Site through SharePoint Groups, please visit the Microsoft article on SharePoint Site Permissions or take the HUIT training Microsoft 365: Managing SharePoint. Share your Files or Folders Giving someone membership permissions to a site typically gives them access to all files and folders on that site. You can also share individual files or folders with people who do not need full site access. When you share files and folders, you can decide whether to let people edit or just view them. Please review the Microsoft article Share SharePoint files or folders for more information. Ensuring there are always at least two site owners It is important to make sure that there are always at least two owners for your SharePoint Site. Use the following instructions to promote a member of your site to an owner. For Team Sites: In the upper right corner, click on the # members When the pane opens on the right side, listing all members of the group, locate the member you would like to make an owner. Click on the down arrow under the name of the member. Select Owner from the list. For Communication Sites: In the upper right corner, click on the Site Access button. When the page opens on the right side, listing the three main permission groups, search for a member you would like to make an owner in the text box. Click on the down arrow under the name of the member. Select Full Control from the list. Customize your Home Page When you view your site for the first time, you will find that the Home page of a Modern SharePoint site is made up of several web parts. Web parts are the building blocks of a SharePoint page. A web part is used to store particular content or information. The web parts that are included in a new SharePoint site are Documents, Activity, and Comments. You may want to customize what web parts are included on your SharePoint pages. To add a webpart To learn how to add a new web part to your SharePoint page, visit the Microsoft article Using web parts on SharePoint pages. To edit the web parts on a SharePoint Page In the upper right corner of the page, click on Edit. The page will display the different webparts with edit options. Clicking on the webpart allows you to change the details of the webpart like the name, view and size. Allows you to move the webpart to another part of the page. Allows you to duplicate the webpart.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Create an online event using Zoom: a checklist,"This guidance is for faculty, staff, or students who are planning to hold an event online using Zoom. Student organizations requiring a Zoom Webinar license for their event need a faculty sponsor and should register the event on TheHub. For any Zoom meeting or webinar, we recommend you also refer to these resources before conducting your event: Tips for making your meeting secure Rules and best practices for recording Hosting accessible remote meetings and events Step 1: Prepare for your online event Thoughtful advanced planning will help you determine your technology needs and if you need expert assistance. Determine your Zoom license needs: Take this self-assessment [link coming soon!] to see whether you need a webinar or large meeting license Create an event “run-of-show"": Think about who does what when—behind-the-scenes is as important as what will be happening on screen. As you create this document, you might consider: When will each presenter speak? Will there be audience participation? Will there be slides? How will transitions between speakers be handled? Assemble your event team: Identify roles and responsibilities for event logistics and content Create a back-up plan: In the unlikely event that a presenter’s network connection drops, or you get Zoom bombed, what’s your plan? Step 2: Create and promote your Zoom event Set up your meeting or webinar in Zoom so that it meets your event needs. Schedule the meeting or webinar in Zoom: The person scheduling the meeting or webinar is the default host and owner of the event. Assign Zoom roles to your event team members: Follow this guidance for how to assign roles so that each team member has the privileges necessary to fulfill their responsibilities. Customize Zoom settings to support your event: Refer to these examples of how to configure your Zoom settings to support various event types. Invite attendees: Send links to attend the event and set expectations about how Q&A will be handled and whether the event will be recorded, if applicable. Step 3: Practice, practice, practice As you prepare and refine content, build familiarity with Zoom. Familiarize yourself with participant management: Learn how to manage your meeting or webinar so that you can confidently engage with participants. Hold a technical rehearsal(s) with your planning team: Set up a dummy meeting or webinar to walk through your run-of-show, following these best practices. Revise the run-of-show based on your rehearsal experience: Send the revised run-of-show to the entire team, including presenters. Hold a run-through with the entire team, including presenters: Like in the technical rehearsal, walk through the run-of-show, being sure to test the audio, video, and bandwidth [pdf] of the presenters. Step 4: Run the event Follow your run-of-show and be ready with your contingency plans. Have team members join early for a final test of sound and video: If you’ve enabled a practice webinar session, start the webinar when the team is ready. If necessary, adjust Zoom settings or roles and start recording according to the run-of-show. Follow the run-of-show: Be prepared to pivot to your contingency plan if something unexpected happens. Step 5: Follow up after the event If you saved to the Cloud, download your event recording. Download recording: Move cloud recordings to appropriate storage. Save Q&A and chat, as well.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Host a Hybrid Meeting Using Zoom,"Hybrid meetings—meetings with some attendees physically in a room and others joining virtually—are becoming more prevalent at Harvard. These tips can help you set up your hybrid meeting, use technology effectively, and ensure both in-person and remote attendees feel engaged. Please note the information included in this checklist is general guidance and is focused on Zoom as the default video conferencing tool. Check with your School or Unit for local departmental processes and best practices. If you’re looking to host a large meeting or event, consider whether Zoom’s webinar format may better suit your needs. Set up your meeting Schedule meeting times to enable breaks. Consider scheduling 20- or 50-minute meetings to leave time at the end for participants to take a break or get to their next meeting. Familiarize yourself with the conference room technology in advance. Find out if your room includes audio-visual technology and contact the HUIT Service Desk or your local IT support if you need help learning how to use the system. If you are using a CADM conference room with a Cisco video conferencing touch panel, find instructions on how to join a meeting here. Include all participation options in your meeting invitation. Ensure the invitation includes both the virtual meeting link and the physical conference room location, and ask in-person attendees to bring their laptops. Host an accessible meeting. Ensure all attendees, including people with disabilities, can participate and engage with content. Invite your attendees to request virtual and/or physical accessibility accommodations if required. Manage your meeting Start the meeting from your computer, not the conference room technology. If you’re the host, starting the meeting from your computer ensures you can use the full range of host controls during the meeting. You can then join as a participant from the conference room to use the audio-visual technology. If your room has a Cisco video conferencing touch panel, find out how to join as a participant here. Ask in-person attendees to use their laptops to join the virtual meeting too. This helps remote attendees see everyone in the conference room and feel more included, as well as helping in-person attendees see presentations more easily and use the collaboration features, including chat. Manage the meeting audio. If you’re using the conference room audio technology, ask in-person attendees to not connect to the Zoom audio to avoid feedback issues: If joining the meeting from a link: Click the arrow next to the Mute button, then select Leave Computer Audio. If joining from the Zoom desktop app using a meeting ID number: Check the Don’t connect to audio box. Take notes on a collaborative document. Post a link to a shared Word or Google Docs document in the chat, so everyone can see notes immediately and add comments or questions. This will also make it easier to share the notes after the meeting. Host an inclusive meeting Use technology to encourage participation. Use meeting reactions and encourage participation in the chat. Consider using Zoom’s whiteboard feature or annotations on a shared screen. And if you need to poll the group, use Zoom’s polling feature or Poll Everywhere to collect everyone’s input. Engage all attendees. Call on both remote and in-person attendees so everyone has an opportunity to speak. Monitor reactions and activity in the chat window or assign a co-facilitator to help you. Use breakout groups thoughtfully. Combine remote and in-person attendees in breakout groups. Integrating remote attendees across breakout rooms ensures that they feel included and valued. Show remote attendees what’s happening in the room. If you need to use physical tools, like the in-room whiteboard, post-it notes, or a flip chart, point a webcam at it so remote attendees can see. Use descriptive language instead of saying “here” or “this” when demonstrating something. Need Help? Chat: Log in to chat live with a HUIT technician Submit a ticket Call: (617) 495-7777"

Install the Panopto Recorder if you have not done so previously: Within your Canvas course on the left-hand navigation click on Panopto. If you do not see Panopto in your left-hand navigation, you will need to enable it in your Navigation first. Click the Create button Click the Record a New Session option Download the correct version of the recorder for the OS you are using and follow the installation directions. If you have already downloaded the recorder, click on the Record a New Session page, then select Launch Panopto. Select the folder for your recording.

Try not to use your computer monitor as a source of light. To get the best quality sound in your recording, do your best to remove any ambient noise in the room. This may be distracting in the final recording. Be mindful of what is in your background. Make sure there is nothing distracting or anything that you wouldn't want your audience to see. For screen capture Make the application you are showing full screen If you're using a browser, remove any distracting bookmarks or hide it entirely If you are showing your desktop, try to keep the desktop icons cleared Turn off notifications by going into Do Not Disturb mode for the duration of the recording For additional information and advanced tips on how to create a recording, see Panopto’s Documentation Instructions on recording with Panopto for Mac Instructions on recording with Panopto for Windows Get help If you'd like help pre-recording lectures with Panopto, you have a few ways to get assistance."
"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Zoom End-to-End Encryption,"These instructions are for all Harvard Zoom account holders to better understand how Zoom handles encryption and what options are available to them. If you are a user of the HBS instance of Zoom, contact HBS IT. If you are a user of the HIPAA instance of Zoom, contact HUHS IT. Enhanced Encryption Zoom meetings and webinars by default use 256-bit AES GCM encryption for audio, video, and application sharing (i.e., screen sharing, whiteboarding) in transit between Zoom applications, clients, and connectors. No further action is required for enabling this protection. You can verify this setting either when scheduling a meeting or during the meeting after it’s started. When scheduling a meeting/webinar: The Encryption field defaults to Enhanced Encryption. During a meeting/webinar: On the top-left of your Zoom window, you will see an icon of a green shield with a checkmark on it. Clicking the icon will bring up a window that confirms your encryption status. End to End Encryption (E2EE) E2EE is best for when you want enhanced privacy and data protection for your meetings and is an extra layer to mitigate risk and protect sensitive meeting content. E2EE is not required for meetings containing level 4 data. E2EE can be enabled for individually scheduled, PMI, and instant meetings. It can also be defaulted to on for all meetings (not recommended). Enabling E2EE for meetings requires all meeting participants to join from the Zoom desktop client, mobile app, or Zoom Rooms. Users will not be able to join by telephone, SIP/H.323 devices, on-premise configurations, the Zoom web client, third-party clients leveraging the Zoom Web SDK, or Lync/Skype clients, as these endpoints cannot be encrypted end to end. E2EE meetings are limited to 1,000 participants. Enabling this setting also disables the following features: Join before host Cloud recording Live streaming Live transcription Breakout Rooms Polling Zoom Apps Zoom Whiteboard Meeting reactions 1:1 private chats E2EE can be enabled on a per-meeting basis or set as a default for all meetings. When scheduling a meeting: Click End-to-end Encryption in the Encryption field. You will see a warning about which features will be disabled as a result. Setting E2EE as the default encryption method: Navigate to https://harvard.zoom.us/, click Sign In, and authenticate if prompted. In the navigation panel, click Settings. Click the Meeting tab. Under Security, verify that Allow use of end-to-end encryption is enabled. Under Default encryption type, choose the default encryption type you want your account to use, either Enhanced encryption or End-to-end encryption. Click Save. To confirm that E2EE is enabled during a meeting: On the top-left of your Zoom window, you will see an icon of a green shield with a lock in it. Clicking the icon will bring up a window with a security code. Users in the meeting can then compare their security codes to make sure they all match. Need Help?

For guidance on how to run a class via Zoom, please see Using Zoom to teach online class sessions. Your Harvard Zoom account allows you to host a meeting with up to 300 participants. Prepare before your meeting: Ask a colleague to act as the meeting co-host. Assign the co-host role to your colleague during your meeting. Note: this can only be done once the meeting has started. With your cohost, plan for how the meeting and participants should be managed. For example: Make sure all participants are muted when they join the meeting Monitor the in-meeting chat window Read chat questions to the presenter, or respond directly Let presenter know if participants have any issues with sound or other meeting logistics Unmute participants if necessary Check out your physical meeting room to see what equipment (projector, camera, speakers, phone) is available and how to use it. Invite a colleague or two to a practice Zoom meeting to get familiar with sharing your screen and confirm your audio and video work. (Tip: go to https://zoom.us/test at any time to test your audio and video.) Include helpful information in your meeting invitation: Using the Zoom add-in, easily populate your meeting invitation with the Zoom meeting details. Communicate expectations for remote meeting participants. For example: All participants will be muted during the meeting If you have any questions or comments during the meeting, use the in-meeting chat [Name of Co-Cost] will read your questions to the presenter If you are having trouble hearing the presenter or seeing the presentation, let [Name of Co-Host] know Optimize the meeting experience for in-person and remote participants Presenters should speak close to the microphone so remote participants can hear. Acknowledge remote participants by looking into the camera (if applicable) or asking if anyone on Zoom has any questions or comments periodically throughout the meeting Position presenters and the video camera to reduce glare for remote participant. Connect to only one audio source in the room to avoid audio feedback. If you are joining the meeting via a video conferencing system in the room, also join from your laptop(s) without audio so that you and your co-hosts can manage your participants. If others in the room are joining Zoom from their laptop, advise them to also not connect to audio. Make participants aware if you are recording your meeting Announce you will be starting the Zoom recording when most or all of your participants are in the meeting. If possible, place a visible sign that states that the meeting is being recorded so that if someone arrives late to the in-person meeting, they can see the sign. Zoom will announce to all those online that the meeting is being recorded, to both those present and to those who join later. Need help? For general help with Zoom, visit the Zoom Help Center.

Example 1: Panel discussion with Q&A (webinar) Example 2: Non-interactive lecture (webinar) Example 3: Interactive, all-hands meeting (meeting) For any Zoom meeting or webinar, we recommend you also refer to these resources before conducting your event: Tips for making your meeting secure Rules and best practices for recording Hosting accessible remote meetings and events Example 1: Panel discussion with Q&A (webinar) A moderator facilitates a discussion among 3 panelists with limited audience engagement through a Q&A session at the end. No registration is required. Panelists: 3 speakers with slides, including a moderator (upgraded to Co-host) to facilitate discussion. Panelists are responsible for muting and unmuting themselves. Host: Manages webinar logistics, attendee view, and troubleshooting Alternative host: Monitors attendee Q&A and joins discussion to share questions with panelists Settings: At time of scheduling Video Host: Off Panelists: Off Audio Telephone and Computer Audio: (on/select) Webinar Options Q&A (on/select): allows attendees to ask (written) questions during the webinar Enable Practice Session (on/select): Allows host, alternative host, and panelists to join the webinar before attendees. Host starts the broadcast. Alternative Hosts Designate an alternative host. Alternative hosts will default to co-hosts if the host has already started the meeting. Q&A Allow anonymous questions: Off/deselect Allow attendees to view answered questions only (on/select): Allows host, alternative host, and panelists some discretion in which questions are answered live. Settings: In practice session Participants panel, under More Allow Participants to Unmute Themselves (on/select): In webinars, attendees are never able to unmute themselves, but with this setting on, panelists and co-hosts are. Play Sound When Someone Joins/Leaves (off/deselect): For large events, this sound becomes disruptive. Allow Participants to Rename Themselves (on/select): Co-hosts can rename themselves so that their role in the meeting is clear (e.g., change to a department name or what their role is—notetaker, moderator, etc.). Allow Panelist to Start Video (on/select): Allows panelist to turn their own video on without host intervention. Allow Attendees to Raise Hand (off/deselect): Monitoring raised hands increases the responsibility of the host and co-hosts. If you leave this on, set expectations with attendees about whether this will be used for questions. Attendee Video Layout – Follow Host’s View (on/select): Allows more precise control of attendee’s view through the view of the host. Please note that this selection doesn’t impact the view that a panelist sees. Chat panel, under ellipsis Allow attendees to chat with—No one: Like raised hands, monitoring chat increases the responsibility of the host and co-hosts and may distract panelists, so it’s recommended that you make this feature inaccessible to attendees. Host, co-hosts, and panelists can still chat with each other, although it’s recommended that you set up a group text for in-webinar communication. Advanced Sharing Options Who can share? -- All Panelists: Allows panelists to manage their own slides. Who can start sharing when someone else is sharing? -- All Panelists: Allows for smoother transitions between panelists’ sharing of slides. Example 2: Non-interactive lecture (webinar) A single speaker making a presentation with no audience participation. No registration required. Host: Manages webinar logistics, attendee view, and troubleshooting Alternative host: Speaker with slides who can also start the webinar if the host is not present. Settings: At time of scheduling Video Host: Off Panelists: Off Audio Telephone and Computer Audio (on/select) Webinar Options Q&A: Off/deselect Enable Practice Session (on/select): Allows host and alternative host to join the webinar before attendees Automatically record webinar (on/select): Eliminate the risk of forgetting to start the recording during the practice session. Please consult these rules and best practices for recording before making this selection. Alternative Hosts Designate an alternative host. Alternative hosts will default to co-hosts if the host has already started the meeting. Q&A Allow anonymous questions: Off/deselect Allow attendees to view answered questions only (on/select): Allows host, alternative host, and panelists some discretion in which questions are answered live. Settings: In practice session Participants panel, under More Allow Participants to Unmute Themselves (on/select): In webinars, attendees are never able to unmute themselves, but with this setting on, panelists and co-hosts are. Play Sound When Someone Joins/Leaves (off/deselect): For large events, this sound becomes disruptive. Allow Participants to Rename Themselves (on/select): Co-hosts can rename themselves so that their role in the meeting is clear (e.g., change to a department name or what their role is). Allow Panelist to Start Video (on/select): Allow Attendees to Raise Hand (off/deselect): Monitoring raised hands increases the responsibility of the host and co-hosts, so it’s recommended that this feature be turned off. Attendee Video Layout – Active Speaker View (on/select): Since there will be just one speaker (assuming the host mutes their microphone), this selection forces the attendee view to be on the active speaker. Please note that this selection doesn’t impact the view that a host or co-host sees. Chat panel, under ellipsis Allow attendees to chat with—No one: Like raised hands, monitoring chat increases the responsibility of the host and co-hosts and may distract panelists, so it’s recommended that you make this feature inaccessible to attendees. Host, co-hosts, and panelists can still chat with each other, although it’s recommended that you set up a group text for in-webinar communication. Advanced Sharing Options Who can share? -- All Panelists (on/select): Allows panelists to manage their own slides. Who can start sharing when someone else is sharing? -- Only Host (on/select): The host maintains control of sharing. Example 3: Interactive, all-hands meeting (meeting) A departmental meeting with a primary speaker with opportunity for participants to engage. Host: Manages meeting logistics, manages participants, shares questions with presenters, and troubleshooting Alternate host: Moderates the discussion; presents slides; can start meeting if host is not present. Participants: 250 participants who can ask/answer questions Settings: At time of scheduling Security Waiting Room (on/select): Allows the host and alternate hosts to join the meeting before participants. Video Host: Off/deselect Panelists: Off/deselect Audio Telephone and Computer Audio: (on/select) Meeting Options Enable join before host (off/deselect): Even if this option is selected, the Waiting Room feature makes it impossible to join before the host. Mute participants upon entry (on/select): Reduces disruption by participants who are not active in the discussion. Alternative Hosts Designate an alternative host according to the example guidance. Alternative hosts will default to co-hosts if the host has already started the meeting. Settings: In meeting Participants panel, under More Allow Participants to Unmute Themselves (on/select): Increases responsibility of host to manage participants, but allows participants to participate in the conversation. Set ground rules ahead of meeting for how to be recognized for your turn to speak (raise hand). Play Sound When Someone Joins/Leaves (off/deselect): Minimizes disruption when participants are allowed into the meeting from the waiting room. Chat panel, under ellipsis Allow attendees to chat with—Host only: Forces discourse to happen in meeting rather than chat, while still giving participants the opportunity to communicate with the host. Advanced Sharing Options Who can share? -- Only Host (on/select): Prevents participants from sharing their screen and reduces impact of potential Zoom bombers. Who can start sharing when someone else is sharing? -- Only Host (on/select): Keeps control of sharing with the host. Need help?

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Harvard Dropbox for Existing Dropbox Teams,"Harvard Dropbox for Existing Teams This article explains the two scenarios for individuals with pre-existing Dropbox Teams that may or may not be migrating into Harvard Dropbox. My Team will be migrating.  Some Harvard personnel already have Dropbox Business accounts that predate Harvard Dropbox or are sponsored by other organizations. If this is the case and you want to use Harvard Dropbox, begin by finding out whether your team will be migrating.  If they are, here’s what you can expect: Your Authorized Requestor, along with your current team administrator, will determine whether your Dropbox Business Team will migrate to Harvard Dropbox as a group. If your team is approved, you and the other members will find your team intact in the Harvard Dropbox environment, when the migration is complete. As a team member in another Dropbox account, respond to instructions you receive in emails from Dropbox or from your Team Administrator.  The migration process should automatically trigger any device that currently syncs with your consumer Dropbox account to also sync with your Harvard University Dropbox account. Dropbox may prompt you to enter your Dropbox credentials on your devices, in order to begin syncing. Click on this link for an overview of syncing.  Note: If your current Dropbox login does not use your HarvardKey primary email address, you will have to change your login to use it before your Team can be migrated. Your Team Administrator should notify you and provide instructions if this is the case.  Click this link for instructions on changing your Dropbox login. My Team will not be migrating. If your team is not migrating, here’s what you can expect: Your Authorized Requestor, along with your current team administrator, will determine whether your Dropbox Business Team will migrate to Harvard Dropbox as a group. You may still be eligible for Harvard Dropbox as an individual, even if your Team is not approved for migration.  Here are the steps you will follow to obtain a Harvard Dropbox account: When Dropbox is informed of Harvard’s decision not to migrate the Team, Dropbox will email you and any other eligible team members from Harvard with an invitation to downgrade your account to a free private consumer account. This is only a transitional step; no data will be lost. Once you have downgraded your account, you will receive an invitation to upgrade it to a Harvard Dropbox account. The invitation will contain instructions for logging in to your account for the first time. With your Harvard Dropbox account, you will be able to collaborate with your old Dropbox team using shared documents and folders (unless your Team and its administrator have decided to discontinue the Team account).

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",What happens when I leave my school or department for employment at another Harvard School?,"If you move to another area of the university your HarvardKey email will most likely change, and your existing Dropbox account will no longer be accessible. In addition, the new school or Harvard entity to which you are employed will both need to be a participating school in this program and agree to fund your Dropbox account for Harvard business use. We recommend discussing your departure and what to do with your Dropbox account before you leave that business unit. The Authorized Requestor from your school should submit a Service Now ticket to the HUIT Service Desk to either delete the Dropbox account or suspend the account upon your departure. When you have claimed your new HarvardKey email address in your new school/department, a new Service Now ticket should be submitted by the new school’s Authorized Requestor, to either have a new Dropbox account created, or reinstate the old account under the new HarvardKey. If you move to another area of the university and your HarvardKey email does not change (remains the same), then your Dropbox account will still be accessible to you, however, your new school or department will need to approve the funding and use of the Dropbox account for Harvard business use. Again, the recommendation is to work through your departure with your existing school or department, and have the Authorized Requestor submit a Service Now ticket to the HUIT Service Desk to delete or suspend the Dropbox account, upon your departure. When you arrive at your new school/department, you can have the new Authorized Requestor submit a ticket to the HUIT Service Desk to either create a new Dropbox account or re-instate the old account. Please note that Harvard Medical School (HMS) is currently not part of the HUIT Harvard Dropbox service. Additional information and steps may be required if you are moving to HMS. For more information, please contact the HMS IT Helpdesk at 2-2000 or itservicedesk@hms.harvard.edu."
"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Manage OneDrive Storage,"OneDrive is an essential tool for faculty, staff, and students, enabling seamless collaboration and cloud-based file storage. However, storage space can quickly fill up with large or unnecessary files, leading to increased storage. To prepare for Microsoft's storage caps, maintain optimal performance, and ensure compliance with institutional policies, it’s crucial to actively manage OneDrive storage. This guide outlines best practices for keeping your storage usage below the storage caps while aligning with Harvard’s record-keeping requirements. Step 1: Review the General Records Schedule Before deleting or moving files, consult Harvard's General Records Schedule (GRS) and any specific departmental guidelines. This ensures compliance with data retention policies that dictate which documents must be preserved for legal, academic, or administrative purposes. At Harvard, certain records must be retained for a specified period, while others can be safely discarded. Be sure to check whether your school or department has any additional records retention policy when making storage decisions. Step 2: Identify and Manage Large Files OneDrive allows you to check file sizes easily, making it simple to identify large items taking up space. How to Check File Sizes in OneDrive: Review the Manage OneDrive Large File Storage article. Once large files have been identified, take action based on their importance and relevance: Options for Managing Large Files Download and Archive: If you need to keep a file but don’t require frequent access, download and store it on an external drive or departmental repository. Move to a Departmental Shared Repository: Files that are relevant to your team or institution should be transferred to departmental SharePoint sites or other shared file repository (Google, Dropbox) to free up individual OneDrive space. Delete Unnecessary Files: Remove outdated or redundant documents, such as old meeting recordings, outdated presentations, and superseded drafts Step 3: Eliminate Drafts and Outdated Versions Many users accumulate unnecessary drafts, multiple file versions, or duplicate content. Regularly review files and delete outdated or redundant versions. Tips for Draft and Version Management: Move final versions of important documents to shared repositories before clearing unnecessary drafts. If collaborative work requires multiple versions, use document comments and track changes instead of creating separate files. Review Version History settings and minimize the number of versions saved. We recommend using the Automatic version history setting. It can save up to 94% of total storage for a file over time. Step 4: Revisit Your OneDrive Files Regularly Establish a habit of reviewing your OneDrive files every week, month, or semester to prevent unnecessary storage buildup. Ongoing Maintenance Checklist: ✅ Check file sizes and remove large or obsolete files. ✅ Organize folders for clarity and easy navigation. ✅ Archive or move long-term files to departmental repositories. ✅ Delete drafts and duplicates to maintain an efficient workspace. By following these best practices, faculty, staff, and students can optimize their OneDrive storage, ensuring compliance with institutional policies while maintaining efficient access to important files.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Determine the best SharePoint and Team membership management approach for you,"This article is for Microsoft 365 users who want a streamlined approach to managing access to their SharePoint site, Team, folders, or files. SharePoint site and Team owners and managers may choose how to control collaborators’ access at the site, folder, or document level by: manually adding a list of individuals using a dynamic group that updates daily based on source-system data (SharePoint Sites only) using a combination of manually added individuals and a dynamic group Dynamic groups are groups of affiliates (employees, students, sponsored roles) that. This eliminates the need to manually maintain groups of individuals that can be determined based on affiliation data. When providing access to an affiliate-based group, manage access using a dynamic group. A dynamic group is a good fit for sharing a SharePoint site, Team, folders, or documents with a straightforward, affiliate-based group such as an entire department, sub-department, or school. With a dynamic group, you don’t have to manually add and maintain a very large population of users. Access privileges automatically change as a person's role changes. Examples of straightforward, affiliate-based groups: All faculty in a school, division or department All staff and contingent workers in a department or division All students and faculty in a school All employees across Harvard Manage access using a dynamic group The process for managing access with a dynamic group depends on whether you have a Team site or a stand-alone SharePoint site: If you manage a SharePoint site, follow these instructions to grant site, folder, or file access to a dynamic group. Note that adding dynamic group access to a stand-alone SharePoint site does not affect existing individual access permissions granted manually using Microsoft 365. If you manage a Team, submit a request to HUIT to manage access using a dynamic group. Adding dynamic group access to a Team will override existing access permissions granted manually using Microsoft 365. Once a dynamic group is being used in a Team, any additional users must be added directly into Grouper. When providing access to a small number of unaffiliated individuals, manage access manually using Microsoft 365. Using a dynamic group is not recommended for smaller groups of individuals without a common affiliation. In these situations, we recommend that you manually add users to your SharePoint site or Team. Examples of groups of unaffiliated individuals: CIOs across the University Project team with 10 members, across various teams Manage access manually using Microsoft 365 You can manually grant access to SharePoint sites, Teams, folders, and files many ways.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Searching In Sharepoint: Best Practices,"Sometimes Sharepoint searches return materials that are not relevant to your search. There are a couple of things that can be done, both as a Sharepoint user and a Sharepoint site owner, that can yield faster and more accurate results. For Sharepoint users: You can use Boolean logic in your searches to specify what exactly you are looking for: AND: searches the content for both keyword 1 and keyword 2 OR: searches content for either keyword 1 or keyword 2 NOT: searches content that contains keyword 1 but does not contain keyword 2. Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) need to be typed in CAPITAL letters and can be used in any search box in Sharepoint. Keywords (words connected by operators) can be a file name, folder name, metadata, or text inside of a document. For Sharepoint site owners: Site indexing runs on a schedule, so there is a possibility that newer material on the site may not yet be indexed. You can reindex your site by going to the Gear icon > Site Information > All Site Settings > Search and Offline Availability > Reindex Site. There are a number of options available in the search settings located in All Site Settings. Usually the default settings are fine, but they can be fine-tuned by site owners.

Computers & Software,Your New FAS Refresh Computer,"These instructions are for FAS faculty and staff with a FAS refresh-funded computer. Your new FAS Desktop computer will provide you with effective, worry-free computing. Since your new computer is part of the FAS Computer Refresh Program, however, there are a few things you should be aware of. FAS Refresh Program computers are purchased. Once the four-year refresh cycle has ended, the computer and all components that came with it must be returned to program in good condition. Please follow these basic guidelines for the proper care of your computer: Any lost components may be billed back to your department. Your computer is tagged with a small label that helps identify the unit as a FAS Computer Refresh Program asset. This sticker must remain on the computer. The tag identifies the four-year anniversary of its deployment and when it will be refreshed. The format of the tag is FYyyQn where (yy) is the Harvard fiscal year (July 1 – June 31) and (n) is the quarter. Example, FY27Q2 is October through December 2027. Do not deface the computer in any way (stickers, permanent markings, etc.). Do not eat or drink near your computer. Liquids and crumbs are one of the leading causes of computer failure. Do not install non-work-related software on the computer. Do not uninstall any of the applications that came with your computer. These are needed to help keep your computer functioning properly. Viruses - be careful which web sites you visit and do not open email attachments from people you do not know as many viruses are caught via these methods. FAS Computers Come with Powerful Security Features Hard Disk Encryption: Encryption on all laptop hard drives is now required to protect personal information. Encrypting the hard drive secures your data in case the laptop is lost or stolen. Virtual Private Networking (VPN): VPN gives you secure access to the University network, network shares, and many FAS applications from anywhere in the world. Just visit http://vpn.fas.harvard.edu from any computer. Antivirus Software: Your computer is protected against virus attacks with regularly updated antivirus software. Data Backup: When your computer has an active internet connection, all the data on your computer is automatically backed up every day to an off-site, secure location. Deleted files can be recovered for up to 90 days. Remote Assistance: HUIT can provide remote assistance to FAS computers anywhere in the world to help you quickly resolve technical difficulties.

Computers & Software,FileMaker General Information,"FileMaker Overview FileMaker or Claris FileMaker is a complete database development and management system consisting of: FileMaker Pro client software - FileMaker Pro client is licensed software installed on users’ computers which is used to open, modify, or create a FileMaker database. It runs on macOS and Windows computers. FileMaker Go, a slightly limited product, runs on iOS devices. Each department is responsible for purchasing its own client licenses. FileMaker Server- FileMaker Server can refer to either the licensed FileMaker software which runs on a cloud hosted server or local server computer. FileMaker databases - A FileMaker database is the document that the FileMaker client software opens and reads. It is stored on and shared by the FileMaker Server. IT Security requires that database be password-protected. FileMaker databases hosted on cloud servers are backed-up once a day and a minimum of a week’s worth of backups are retained. FileMaker Web Direct - If a FileMaker database is configured to allow it, the database can be accessed with a web browser. Web Direct requires sufficient user licenses for the number of simultaneous connections. Best Practices Know Your Departments FileMaker Administrator: Make sure you know who your department's FileMaker Administrator is. This person has full administrative access to your database(s). Know Your Credentials: Ensure you know your login credentials, including your username and password. Please note that HUIT does not have access to departmental databases and cannot reset login credentials. Keep Updated: Always keep your FileMaker client license current and promptly run updates when requested. Security FileMaker cloud hosted servers with Soliant Consulting Inc. for Harvard schools and departments are locked down to Harvard networks and Harvard VPNs only and have been certified by Harvard Information Security to host up to Harvard Level 3 data. Departments are responsible for knowing their data levels and managing their databases to assure that access is limited to authorized users, and that the data is properly stored and encrypted. Please reference Harvard Information Security data policies. Versions The current version of the FileMaker suite of products is 24. FileMaker cloud servers should be kept at up-to-date FileMaker supported versions and FileMaker client licenses should be up-to-date as well. FileMaker Server 24 FileMaker client 20 or above Older versions of FileMaker Pro clients must be upgraded to be stored on a cloud-based server. Instructions are available for verifying your FileMaker client license version. Questions If you have FileMaker questions or concerns chat with a HUIT technician, submit a ticket, or call (617) 495-7777."
Computers & Software,Security Tools and Processes for Managed Windows and Apple Computers,"NOTE: There is a user focused KB that is placed on the desktop of all provisioned Windows computers KB0011452 and KB0020049 for all provisioned Apple Computers. System Requirements Windows 10/11 with 8GB+ RAM + 20% free disk space MacOS 11.x, 12.x or 13.x with 8GB+ RAM + 20% free disk space CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor CrowdStrike is our primary AV and Intrusion Detection tool. It is managed by the Information Security & Data Privacy team. KB0018066 Installation The CrowdStrike client is installed during the computer provisioning process. CrowdStrike self-updates as Security releases new versions. On Macs additional Configuration Policies are set to apply to each device giving CrowdStrike full disk access. Installation Remediation There is an SCCM task that looks for systems missing CrowdStrike and installs it. There is a Jamf Smart Group and Policy that looks for systems missing CrowdStrike and installs it. Exclusions Any user requesting an exclusion would need to get approval from HUIT Security. If approved, Security would provide an uninstall token so a tech could perform the uninstall. We would also add the computer to the CrowdStrike Exclusion collection in SCCM or Jamf so it would not get automatically reinstalled. Encryption All Laptops are required to be encrypted. Installation Windows Bitlocker is our approved encryption tool. It is managed by SCCM, which stores the recovery keys. Encryption is initiated during provisioning and there are SCCM policies in place to encrypt computers if they did not go through our provisioning process. Macs FileVault is our approved encryption tool for macOS and is managed by Jamf, which stores the recovery keys. Encryption is initiated during provisioning and Jamf Smart groups detect the encryption status of laptop computers and is used to encrypt devices if they did not go through our provisioning process. Exclusions Any user asking to be excluded from Bitlocker or FileVault encryption is added to the ‘Decrypt Bitlocker’ collection in SCCM or the “FileVault Exclusion” Smart Group. Recovery Windows If a user needs a recovery key, Technicians can get it from the SCCM Web site https://uiswapps1000012.university.harvard.edu/helpdesk or from the SCCM Bitlocker app in the HUIT Toolkit. Macs If a user needs a recovery key, Technicians can get it from the Jamf Web site https://casper01.cadm.harvard.edu:8443 Reporting Every month we run a report to show our Encryption status. Patching Installation Patches are installed using SCCM and Jamf. We have a three-phase testing schedule and a two-phase rollout schedule. 3rd party patches are provided by PatchMyPC which is fully integrated with SCCM and by Jamf and Vendors. Exclusions Any system that needs to be excluded from patching is added to the Patch Exclusion collection in SCCM and Inventory Only mode in Jamf. This is supposed to be a temporary assignment. The collection membership is reviewed on a regular basis. Reporting We have ongoing reports of our patch progress. Operating System Updates Operating Systems (OS) are only supported for a limited amount of time. We deploy new versions of the OS once a year. Some of these updates are silent installs and others require a period of activity that will disrupt the user. In those cases we notify the user and provide options for the user to upgrade at a time that is convenient for them. Firewall Installation We use the built in Operating System firewall. This is enabled by SCCM to always be on. Exclusions Any system that needs to be excluded from the Firewall policy can be added to the SCCM collection: Endpoint Protection Exclusions Confidential Data Spirion is used to assist users in finding data on their computer that contains confidential data such as credit card and social security numbers. This is run as needed by the user. This tool is available to Mac and PC users via our self service tools. Data Backup We recommend that all users use OneDrive to store their files. This allows them to access their data from any computer. We also provide CrashPlan backup software to Central Administration and FAS departments. Other schools can purchase licenses from us as well. Sensitive Data Detection Users can use the Spirion application to search their computer to find any files that contain sensitive data such as credit cards, social security numbers, driver license, etc. They can use the program to securely delete these files."

Computers & Software,User Account Management in FileMaker databases,"User Account Management in FileMaker databases Every user of every FileMaker database is required to have individual login usernames and passwords. As with all login accounts, Harvard IT Security prohibits sharing of user accounts. Additionally, the use of Guest accounts or any accounts without passwords is prohibited within FileMaker databases. FileMaker databases hosted by HUIT/Soliant use one of two forms of user account management, based on server and database configuration: FileMaker-Based User Authentication (FM) Usernames and passwords and roles are completely defined within the FileMaker databases. This requires a FileMaker administrator to make every user add/modify/delete to every database file. If your databases use FileMaker-Based User Authentication, follow FM Step 1 through FM Step 5 below. Harvard Key User Authentication (HK) Harvard Key authenticates the user based on Azure AD groups, with roles defined within the FileMaker databases. The FileMaker administrator adds the group names and their roles to each database file. User add/modify/deletes are handled through Active Directory's Azure AD groups, and do not need any additional support from a FileMaker administrator. [Harvard Key User Authentication documentation coming soon] FM Step 1: Open the FileMaker database using a FileMaker user account with Admin privileges. FM Step 2: Open the Manage Security window in the FileMaker database. FM Step 3: The Manage Security window. This window shows the list of active user accounts for the FileMaker database. Press the [+New] button to add a user. The newly created user's account name is ""New Account"". In the right pane under Account Name, replace New Account with the user's account name. Use whichever name format works best for your group. Some examples might be ""bob"", ""bobsmith"", ""bqs338"", ""bob_smith@harvard.edu"" etc Now, click on the pencil icon next to the Password area in the right pane. Here, enter a new password twice (for confirmation), then press Set Password. And now, select the level of privilege the user will have in the database. Click on the pencil icon near Privilege Set in the right pane: These pre-defined privs are: [Full Access] User is the administrator of the database. User can not only read and write all data, but can also modify the layouts and database setup itself. Every database file must have at least one user with Full Access. [Data Entry Only] User can read all data in a layout, and can add and modify data as well. User cannot modify any part of the database layout itself. Sometimes used as the Privilege Set for most non-admin users. [Read-Only Access] User can only read the data; the user cannot change or add data, or affect the database layout. Now we see the user bobsmith has a password, the account is active, and the user only has Read-Only access to the data. Repeat this process for each user to be added to the database. FM Step 4: Disable the [Guest] and Admin Accounts After there is at least one user account with [Full Access] privs, the [Guest] and the Admin accounts are disabled for good security. To disable an account, uncheck the ✅ checkbox next to the [Guest] and Admin accounts in the Manage Security window. FM Step 5: Multi-file FileMaker Databases and User Accounts If your FileMaker solution includes multiple files, the above steps must be done in each file. For your database to work correctly, each user should be in every database file with exactly the same username and password. For example, if the above FileMaker database had three different .fmp12 files, the bobsmith user should be in each file with the same password in each file."

Profiles are what Outlook uses to organize and maintain your e-mail accounts. They are made up of e-mail accounts, data files, and information about where your e-mail is stored. Most users only need one profile, even if they have multiple email accounts, but occasionally, users may want or need to setup a separate, secondary profile for other email accounts they have access to.

Uncheck the box next to Set up Outlook Mobile on my phone, too and click Finish. The new Profile will be listed. You can choose to be prompted for a profile or for a profile to be opened by default.

If you find that you need to add people to your safe and block lists in the future feel free to do so. If you are getting a lot of spam, you may choose the 'Restrictive' spam detection level in Proofpoint's console settings. Please follow the instructions below to turn your Junk Filters off. Turning off Outlook Junk Filter: Microsoft Office Outlook Client PC: Click on the Junk tool button in the toolbar near the top left of the Outlook window. Click to select Junk E-Mail Options.

Email & Calendars,Fix Mail Delivery Issues on Mailman 3 Lists,"These troubleshooting steps are for Mailman list owners that encounter problems with mail delivery to @gmail.com list members. Issue Email delivery issues can happen when some email providers, such as Gmail, Yahoo, or AOL, reject or mark messages as spam that are sent from a list but have a different sender address. This is because these providers use email authentication to verify the authenticity of the sender and prevent spoofing and phishing. Resolution To improve the mail delivery issues on a Mailman list, on 5/14/2024 HUIT changed the default settings on all lists without the proper settings so that the From: address appears in the list address. This way, the list domain will match the sender domain, and the messages will pass the email authentication checks. The instructions to change the list settings manually follow: Go to the Mailman homepage and click on the Login button. Select the option to sign in with your HarvardKey and enter your username and password. Open the list you need to troubleshoot Click on Settings in the menu bar and click on DMARC Mitigations. For DMARC mitigation action, select Replace From: with list address from the dropdown. This will replace the original sender's Display name with [Senders display name] via [the list name] in the From: header. For DMARC Mitigate unconditionally, select Yes Scroll down and click Save changes. Get help Chat: Log in to chat live with a HUIT technician Submit a ticket Call: (617) 495-7777"
Email & Calendars,Email Sender Policy Framework,"This article is for Harvard email users who have received a Sender Policy Framework warning on an incoming message. If an incoming email fails Sender Policy Framework (SPF) validation, you will see the following or similar warning at the top of an email: WARNING: Harvard cannot validate that this message was sent from an authorized system. Please be careful when opening attachments, clicking links, or following instructions. For more information, visit the HUIT IT Portal and search for SPF. What is SPF? Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication tool used by Harvard University Information Technology and other institutions to prevent fraudulent emails. Organizations publish a list of authorized systems to send emails on their behalf, known as their SPF record. Receiving email systems check the SPF record to validate the sender. If an email fails SPF validation, a warning message will appear at the top of the email. Not all emails from addresses that fail SPF are bad, and it is common for bulk emailers and other email services to “spoof” another organization's email domain to send notifications. If you receive an email with an SPF warning, take extra precautions before replying or clicking on any links. Carefully examine the email, familiarize yourself with common signs of phishing, and do not click on links or open attachments. Please follow these steps for any suspicious email: Look carefully at the email address to ensure that it matches the sender and their correct domain. Get familiar with the common signs of phishing. Do not click on links or open attachments. Do not download images. If you suspect a phishing email, forward it to phishing@harvard.edu. If you receive an SPF warning from an expected internal or external sender, submit a ticket to the Service Desk or notify the sender's IT department. SPF warning on email from expected sources Emails received from Harvard internal and external senders are checked for SPF validation. Occasionally, you may get a message from an expected source that has an SPF warning. If you get a warning on a message that appears to be from an expected internal Harvard sender, please submit a ticket to the Service Desk so that we can verify the authenticity of the sender. HUIT may be able to add information to our validation process to eliminate the warning. If you get a warning on a message that appears to be from an expected external sender, the sending entity will need to evaluate and adjust their systems to eliminate the warning. To resolve an issue with an external entity's SPF records, the IT department for that entity must be notified that email sent from their domain failed SPF validation.

Email & Calendars,Set up DKIM Keys for bulk email services,"These steps to set up DKIM keys for are for people that are using 3rd party systems to send bulk email from Harvard domains. Email providers (Google, Yahoo, etc) are increasing enforcement of email authentication in order to prevent spam and phishing in their environments starting in February 2024. To prevent delivery issues for bulk mailing services sending as Harvard domains, DKIM keys need to be set up for each 3rd party instance for each Harvard domain that is used so that recipient email providers have a way to authenticate email from Harvard senders. Create DKIM keys in 3rd party Please create a DKIM key for each 3rd party AND each domain used to send from that vendor and submit to HUIT on our DKIM Submission Form Here are instructions for getting DKIM keys from some popular email service providers. If the instructions below do not work for you, please contact your vendor and ask for assistance: Salesforce/Salesforce Marketing Cloud: Generating your own DKIM keys is dependent on on your subscription. If you have the ability to create your own DKIM keys, follow these instructions: Log in to your Salesforce/Salesforce Marketing Cloud account and go to Admin > Account > Domain Management Click ""Add Domain"" and enter your domain Click ""Generate DKIM Keys"" to create new public and private keys If you do not have the ability to create your own DKIM keys, follow these instructions: Work with your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account rep to purchase Private Domains for each domain/sub-domain that you send from. Once this is completed (Marketing Cloud team calls this a SKU), a parent case will be created in Marketing Cloud. After the parent case is created the Marketing Cloud back-end team will reach out with further communications and will take care of the complete configuration on the Marketing Cloud side, once they have the necessary details. Because Harvard will host the DNS on our end, the Marketing Cloud back-end team will provide a zone file which contains the necessary DNS records for successful configuration. This zone file needs to be submitted to HUIT to be implemented into the DNS records. Once HUIT confirms the DNS records are implemented you will need to update the Salesforce case to let them know it is implemented on Harvard’s side. Then, the Marketing Cloud back-end team will re-validate the DNS records, and will do the final steps to complete the configuration. WhatCounts: Log in to your WhatCounts account and go to Settings > Domains Click the domain you want to add DKIM for and select ""DKIM"" from the menu Copy the generated public and private keys Acoustic: Log in to your Acoustic account and go to Settings > Domains Click the domain you want to add DKIM for and select ""DKIM Keys"" Copy the generated public and private keys MailChimp: Log in to your MailChimp account and go to Account > Domains Click the domain you want to add DKIM for and select ""DKIM Settings"" Copy the generated public and private keys Delivera: Log in to your Delivera account and go to Settings > Domains Click the domain you want to add DKIM for and select ""DKIM Keys"" Copy the generated public and private keys The process is generally similar across services.

Email & Calendars,Missing emails in my Google email,"These troubleshooting steps are for users who missing emails sent from external users to their Harvard provided Google accounts or consumer Gmail accounts. Resolution Google and other email providers are implementing stricter email authentication requirements to help keep inboxes free of malicious or unwanted email. Senders who don’t meet these requirements may experience delivery issues when sending emails.

Information Security,Keep your data and devices safe while traveling,"This guidance is for Harvard faculty, staff, students, and researchers who are planning travel and want to keep their personal and Harvard-issued devices and data as safe as possible. Faculty, staff and researchers planning travel to Cuba, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria or regions of Ukraine (Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Sevastopol) should also consult HUIT’s guidance on traveling to high cyber risk locations. If you are conducting research or planning to use university research data while traveling, consult Harvard’s research data management policies and Harvard's export control policies & procedures before departure. Before traveling to any country, visit the Harvard Global Support Services website for more country-specific guidance and to register your travel. You may also refer to local contacts or travel policies for your School*, if available: Harvard Law School Harvard Medical School Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health School security and data privacy officers *International students and scholars should consult with their advisor in the Harvard International Office before leaving the US to discuss US immigration actions, their individual circumstances, and the requirements and guidance to be able to re-enter the US. Prepare your device(s) for travel It's common for some governments to monitor and store Internet activity or copy data from your device without your consent. At your port of entry, some government authorities may request access to your electronic devices and accounts. This includes common border security measures in the United States. Before you leave, familiarize yourself with your destination’s IT security laws and practices and then prepare your devices for travel, by following these tips: Install updates to your software and operating systems to prevent cyber criminals from exploiting known bugs. Ensure that your passwords are strong, complex, and unique using a password manager like 1Password. Enable 2-step verification on your personal accounts, if available. Note: Both Duo and OKTA —the third-party tools that Harvard uses for 2-step verification—blocks authentications from OFAC-sanctioned countries and regions. Back up your data and media to a device you'll leave at home. Sanitize your devices to clear them of documents or media that could be perceived as provocative or inflammatory by certain governments. Less is best. Bring the least amount of information and data and the fewest devices possible. Download and set up device managers like Find my iPhone/iPad/Mac and Find My Device (for Android) to locate your device if lost or stolen and erase it remotely if needed. Encrypt your devices in case of loss or theft. Harvard-owned devices should be encrypted by policy. Check with your local IT department to ensure that your system is encrypted. Certain countries restrict encrypted devices; if you're traveling to a country that does so, contact your local IT department. Use your device while traveling Turn off your device, or at least the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, when crossing through security checkpoints and when not in use. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) if using hotel or public Wi-Fi. A VPN creates a more secure connection between your device and the resources you access. Certain countries may restrict or ban VPN usage; if you're traveling to a country that does so and would like more guidance, request an Information Security and Data Privacy consultation. Limit use of public terminals, and don’t use accounts requiring usernames and passwords—especially for Harvard accounts—on public machines. Clear your Internet browser after each use to delete your history, cookies, cache, and downloaded or temporary files. Alternatively, use your browser’s private browsing or incognito feature. Report incidents, such as suspected or actual device compromise, loss, or data exposure. Upon your return, secure your device Run antivirus software to scan your device for malware and follow the instructions to correct any issues. Reset passwords for accounts you accessed over public wifi (e.g., unsecured guest network) Report incidents, such as suspected or actual device compromise, loss, or data exposure.

Information Security,Vendor Risk Assessment FAQs,"Frequently Asked Questions Question: What is a Vendor Risk Assessment? Answer: A Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA) is an assessment of an organization’s security, confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy policies and practices. VRAs help us make informed decisions when selecting a vendor to collect, handle, store, or host Harvard data. Question: Is a VRA required? Answer: Vendors intended to have access to DSL4 data/systems must have a Vendor Risk Assessment per Harvard University Information Security Policy. V3: The security design, policies, and procedures of vendors and other third parties who will collect, process, host or store Level 4 information or manage Harvard critical systems must be reviewed by a University Information Security Officer. Question: What do I need to do to ensure my vendor with Data Security Level 3 or 4 data complies with policy? Answer: A contract must be executed with the vendor by a university negotiating office, such as Harvard Strategic Procurement. The contract must incorporate specific privacy and security riders approved by the Office of the General Counsel and may require additional GDPR or accessibility related terms and conditions. Depending on your use case and data classification, it may include High Risk Confidential Information (HRCI) Rider(s) as well as GDPR, accessibility, HIPAA/BAA terms, as appropriate. To submit a contract review request to the Strategic Procurement Contracts team use the following Qualtrics Survey tool. If contracting with a vendor for a hosted service (for example, a SaaS) it must be integrated with university central authentication, usually Harvard Key, for identity and access management, and multi-factor authentication of authorized users by DUO. To register your platform, initiate a request here: Authentication & Attribute Registration CAS/SAML/SP Usage Request Vendors and other third parties who will collect, process, host or store Level 4 information or manage Harvard critical systems must be reviewed by a University Information Security Officer for a Vendor Risk Assessment Question: Can a review be requested for a vendor who has access to Data Security Level 3 information? Answer: Yes, if you feel it will help make an informed decision or aid you in contract negotiation we can perform a light weight assessment on the vendor for you although it is not a policy requirement. Question: How do I request a Vendor Risk Assessment? Answer: To initiate a VRA, complete the VRA intake questionnaire. A member of the University Information Security and Data Privacy (ISDP) team will then review the request and contact you before initiating the related vendor activities. Question: When does a Vendor Risk Assessment occur? Answer: Contract review may happen in parallel with the VRA, but the contract should not be executed before the VRA is completed. Additionally, at contract renewal (normally every 3 years) or when major changes are made to the contract it is a good time to leverage the vendor for an updated assessment. Question: How long does the VRA process take to complete? Answer: The first phase of the VRA process requires the vendor to complete a robust security questionnaire and for Data Security Level 4 vendors they provide validation of selected controls. Depending on the maturity and resource availability of the vendor's security team this can be time consuming, we recommend initiating the VRA 6-8 weeks prior to your contract date when possible to allow the vendor adequate time to respond. Question: What can I do to ensure a quick Vendor Risk Assessment? Answer: Not every vendor will be willing to negotiate a contract that differs from their standard contract or click-through agreement. Ask first, not every vendor is prepared to handle regulated data and/or other high-risk data types (DSL4). Review the vendor’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If it’s a vendor hosted product, look for elements like Limitations of Use statements that prohibit users from uploading certain regulated data types such as personally identifiable information, governmental ids, health or medical information, clinical data, etc. If you see language like this, it is potentially an indicator that the vendor may not wish to collect, store, host or process DSL4 data. Keep your vendor engaged and quick in frequently to see how they are progressing. Question: How do I know my vendor is ready to perform a Vendor Risk Assessment? Answer: A vendor with a mature security program will monitor for vulnerabilities and address them. They will also participate in external security audits and make third party audit reports like the SOC 2, SSAE 18, or ISAE 3402 available to customers. Ask if your vendor offers any of these reports available for review. If they do, it’s likely they will respond quick to the assessment. If vendor security information is published, check to see that your data will be protected by encryption (at rest, in transit, or both), and review security terms for important but often overlooked aspects of the data lifecycle such as data retention, archiving, and data destruction at termination of service. Question: Where can I locate existing Vendor Risk Assessments? Answer: Buy to Pay has a repository of the Vendor Risk Assessments the Information Security Educational & Consulting team have completed. A member from your negotiating office should have access to pull the report on your behalf. Question: Can I share the findings of the assessment with my vendor? Answer: If the vendor has completed the assessment within the CyberGRX portal the vendor has a full copy of the findings and mitigation steps to reduce the risk identified in their environment. All reports written by the Information Security Education & Consulting team are considered internal use only and not to be shared with external parties.

Information Security,"Respond to online abuse, harassment, and intimidation","In recent years, there has been an increase in incidents of online harassment from outsiders targeted at the academic community. Students, faculty, staff, postdocs, and other academic appointees who publish articles, provide expert commentary, or are active on social media can become targets for online harassment. Online harassment can take different forms: “Trolling” occurs when individuals deliberately follow and provoke others online, often with offensive content. While most trolling is merely a nuisance, occasionally trolling attacks can escalate to threats or to the point where numerous individuals are engaged in harassing the target and/or target’s organization. “Doxing” (sometimes “doxxing”) occurs under Harvard’s policies when a community member publicly shares an individual’s personal information without their permission with the intention and effect of intense harassment. (Full definition of doxing) “Cyberbullying” is the willful and repeated harm inflicted through using computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices. These situations can be very intense, alarming, and disruptive to an individual. Online targeting can also have real consequences for livelihoods and careers. Harvard provides this information as a resource for community members who have been identified and targeted for online abuse, harassment, and intimidation. Please note the following guidance contains resources and information on reporting incidents of cyber-bullying, doxing, or trolling. It is not the process for reporting conduct that violates or may violate the University’s harassment/discrimination/bullying policy. You can find information about that policy here.

Steps you can take to combat online abuse and harassment include (1) requesting takedowns of false statements that may have been made in error, (2) requesting that platforms and web domain registrars remove abusive content, (3) documenting the abuse (i.e., preserving evidence), (4) reporting threats and other criminal misconduct to law enforcement, and (5) obtaining legal advice regarding consequences to you and possible civil actions against abusers. Legal action may be of limited utility in these matters. We discuss this in more detail in the sections below. Requests to Take Down False Statements If an organization has posted false or misleading statements about you on its website, social media accounts, or elsewhere, and these statements are causing you to suffer harm, you may consider sending a written request to the organization to remove or correct the statements. In such a communication it is important that you (1) identify yourself, (2) identify the statements that are false or misleading, (3) explain why the statements are false or misleading, and (4) describe how the statements are harming you. Not all such requests will be successful, but longstanding organizations with financial resources and credibility in the broader community may see that correcting false, harmful information is in their self-interest. Takedown requests directed to individual user accounts on social media platforms may not be as well received—especially if the accounts are anonymous or pseudonymous. An example of a request to take down false information is attached below (“Sample Request To Take Down False Statements”). If the recipient of your initial request ignores or declines it, you may consider engaging an attorney to write a follow-up letter on your behalf. In cases where a user account has posted false or misleading statements about you on a social media or other publishing platform, you may have the additional option of reporting the content to the platform. See the next section below. Generally speaking, social media sites are reluctant to referee disputes over whether the content of a particular post is true or false. Indeed, you are likely to find that the applicable community standards or guidelines do not prohibit false statements (as opposed to, say, impersonations). Accordingly, while the platform may seem to be a more rational and objective actor than the user account, you may find that the platform does not act on the report. Note: Before you submit a request to take down harmful content, you should save a copy of the content in order to preserve evidence of the abuse. See below (“Document What’s Happening”). Requests To Take Down Abusive, Harassing, or Threatening Posts/Web Content If a user account has posted abusive, harassing, or threatening statements about you or directed at you on a social media or other publishing platform, you may submit a takedown request to the platform, in accordance with the platform’s rules and requirements, several of which we have linked here: Blogger/ Blogspot: Content Policy, Report a Community Violation. Facebook: Community Standards, Report Something. Instagram/ Threads: Community Guidelines, How to Report Things. Sidechat: Community Guidelines. Users may report a post for removal by emailing support@sidechat.lol. Substack: Content Guidelines (“If you encounter content that may be in breach of these guidelines or have any questions about them, you can email us at tos@substackinc.com.”). TikTok: Community Guidelines, Report a Problem. Truth Social: Terms of Use § 7 (“Prohibited Activities”). We were unable to find a reporting function on Truth Social, but § 32 of the Terms of Use document states as follows: “In order to resolve a complaint regarding the Service or to receive further information regarding use of the Service, please contact us at support@truthsocial.com. “Users may report ‘hateful conduct,’ as defined by New York law, to legal@tmtgcorp.com.” Wordpress: User Guidelines, Report a Site. X/ Twitter: The X Rules, Report Violations. YouTube: Community Guidelines. To report content on YouTube, you can click the “Report” button underneath the video frame on each video’s webpage. To reveal the “Report” button, click the icon with three dots on it, just under the right-bottom corner of the video. In cases where abusive content is posted on a website operated by the speakers themselves (rather than, say, Facebook or Substack), you may still be able to request that it be taken down. Many companies that provide web hosting services have their own community standards/acceptable use policies and allow visitors to websites to report abuse. We have included some prominent web hosting vendors in the list below: DreamHost: Acceptable Use Policy, Report Abuse. GoDaddy: Universal Terms of Service § 5 (“General Rules of Conduct”), Report Abuse. Hostinger: Universal Terms of Service § 5 (“General Rules of Conduct”), Report Abuse. WP Engine: Acceptable Use Policy. Users may report violations of the Acceptable Use Policy to abuse@wpengine.com or (512) 273-3906. Each social media platform or web hosting service applies its own standards and principles in reviewing and acting on requests to take down content. As noted above, platforms are reluctant to referee disputes over whether the content of a particular post is true or false. They are far more likely to take action against communications that are abusive, harassing, or threatening or that impersonate you or seek to mislead or defraud the viewer. You can find more details on each site’s rules and reporting pages. We generally do not recommend that you engage directly with a social media account or website that is targeting you with abuse, harassment, or threats. If you see content on a social media platform or website that is directed at you and violates the site’s community standards, you should report the content to the platform or web host. An example of a request to take down abusive, harassing, or threatening posts is attached below (“Sample Request To Take Down Abusive, Harassing, or Threatening Posts/Web Content”). Note: Before you submit a request to take down harmful content, you should save a copy of the content in order to preserve evidence of the abuse. See below (“Document What’s Happening”). Requests To De-Register Abusive Domain Names We are aware of instances in which an online harasser has registered the names of individual persons as web domains and established websites at those domains to host online attacks on the named persons. It may be possible to have these domain names de-registered. The first step is to conduct a “whois” search to identify what domain registrar company (e.g., Domain.com, GoDaddy) has registered the domain. Requests To Domain Name Registrars. To perform a “whois” search, go to https://lookup.icann.org/en and enter the domain name into the search window. The search results will display, among other things, “Domain Information,” “Contact Information,” and “Registrar Information.” The Registrar Information block identifies the domain registrar. The Contact Information block displays the contact information for the person who registered the domain, which may be a proxy company that has been paid to register the domain name on the actual user’s behalf, so that you cannot tell who is really operating the website. In any case, several links will appear in the Contact Information block that, if clicked, will take you to the domain registrar’s website. The landing page on the domain registrar’s website should display a phone number and email you can contact to report abuse to the registrar. In addition, the registrar’s website will likely provide information about community standards for its registrants and how to report violations of its policies. Links to this information can usually be found in the footer of the website behind links that say “Legal,” “Terms of Use,” or “Terms of Service.” We have collected below the community standards policies and reporting information posted by several popular domain registrars. The first link in each line is to information about the registrar’s content standards: i.e., what is allowed on their registered websites and what is not. The second link is to information about how to report abuse. Domain.com: Acceptable Use Policy, Report Member Violations. DreamHost: Acceptable Use Policy, Report Abuse. GoDaddy: Universal Terms of Service § 5 (“General Rules of Conduct”), Report Abuse. Hostinger: Universal Terms of Service § 5 (“General Rules of Conduct”), Report Abuse. Namecheap: Acceptable Use Policy, Report Abuse. Porkbun: Product Terms of Service (“Acceptable Use Policy” section), Report Abuse. If you use the registrar’s abuse reporting function and the registrar agrees that the website registered under your name has violated its content policies, the registrar may de-register the domain name. De-registration of a domain name is a big step for a registrar to take, and it will be more likely to take that step if the domain name contributes to violations of the registrar’s rules. In cases where the site posts abusive content but the domain name itself is not objectionable, a takedown request to the web hosting company is more likely to be successful than a request to decommission the domain name. (In many cases the domain registrar also provides web hosting services for the site.) An example of a request to de-register domain names is attached below (“Sample Request To De-Register Abusive Domain Names”). You can use the same template to submit a de-registration request to a domain name registry. The fact that one domain registrar company has taken steps to de-register a domain does not mean that the harasser cannot go to another registrar to re-register the name. Accordingly, you may need to visit the domain name periodically to see if it has been re-registered and is posting the abusive content again. If so, you will need to do another whois search and report abuse to the current registrar. Alternatively, you can register the domain name yourself, so that you can exclude others from using it. Note: Before you submit a request to de-register a domain name, you should save a copy of all the content posted on the website in question in order to preserve evidence of the abuse. See below (“Document What’s Happening”). Requests To Domain Name Registries. In addition to reporting abuse to a domain name registrar, you may also try reporting abuse to a domain name registry. A registry is an organization that controls the registration of all domain names within a top-level domain (“TLD”) like “.com” or “.org.” The registry for .com and .net domains is Verisign, and the registry for .org domains is the Public Interest Registry. We have gathered the following information about reporting abuse to these organizations: Verisign: “For any inquiries related to malicious conduct in the Verisign managed TLDs please contact Verisign at … abuse@verisign.com.” Public Interest Registry: Anti-Abuse Policy (generally disfavoring suspension of domain names, except in rare cases, such as “credible and specific incitements to violence” and “credible threats to human health or safety”), Report Abuse. Our sense is that it may be more difficult to persuade a domain-name registry to de-register than to persuade a registrar to do so, so you should first try the applicable registrar. Note: Before you submit a request to de-register a domain name, you should save a copy of all the content posted on the website in question in order to preserve evidence of the abuse. See below (“Document What’s Happening”). Document What's Happening If you are experiencing online abuse, harassment, or threats, you should take steps to preserve evidence of the communications. Save any emails, voicemails, or text messages you receive. Take screenshots or photos of comments on social media; because such comments can be deleted, screenshots are often useful to help document them. While it may seem counterintuitive to hold onto messages or posts that are upsetting, it can be helpful down the line to have retained evidence of an attack, particularly one involving threats. Create a folder separate and apart from your live accounts and store copies or 5 screenshots of the abusive communications inside it. This way you can keep the evidence without having to see the communications again and again as you use these systems. Reporting Criminal Conduct States, including Massachusetts, have written criminal laws to protect their residents against harassment and intimidation. The Massachusetts criminal harassment statute makes it a crime to “willfully and maliciously engage[] in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person, which seriously alarms that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.” The Massachusetts antistalking law makes it a crime to “(1) willfully and maliciously engage[] in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person which seriously alarms or annoys that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, and (2) make[] a threat with the intent to place the person in imminent fear of death or bodily injury.” Either of these criminal offenses may be accomplished online, if the online communications satisfy the elements of the crime and the conduct consists of true threats unprotected by the First Amendment. If you or those close to you are in imminent physical danger or there has been a direct threat of physical violence, you should immediately call the Harvard University Police Department at (617) 495-1212 if you are on the Harvard campus. If you are not on campus, call 911. If there is no immediate physical threat, but you have received a credible threat to your personal safety or feel you have been criminally harassed, you may call HUPD at (617) 4951212. You may wish to ask HUPD what is involved in seeking a Harassment Prevention Order. Seeking Immigration Help Some members of the community may have questions about how abusive or harassing online conduct may affect their immigration status or prospects. International students can reach out to their advisor in the Harvard International Office with concerns related to their immigration status. Harvard Law School’s Harvard Representation Initiative (“HRI”) may also be able to answer your questions. HRI’s main phone line is (617) 495-6648, and its emergency line is (857) 242-6755. You may also reach out directly to HRI by emailing hri@law.harvard.edu for a free consultation. Legal Consultations You may wish to explore whether to pursue a legal complaint for online harassment. In doing so, be sure to explore with your lawyer the benefits and risks of pursuing a legal claim, the cost of doing so, and the barriers to a successful claim. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Massachusetts state constitution accord considerable legal protection to expression on matters of public interest. This does not mean, however, that the right to free speech bars all lawsuits based on the defendant’s expression. Rather, courts factor First Amendment considerations into their review of civil 6 claims. For example, a person who is the subject of untrue statements injurious to their reputation may bring a lawsuit for defamation, but the First Amendment accords some space to speakers who make a false statement, based on their level of fault. When evaluating whether to pursue a civil claim against a doxer or other person or entity engaging in online abuse, harassment, and intimidation, ask your counsel what you can expect in litigation. Because civil cases are public proceedings, they may have the effect of amplifying the doxer’s message to a broader audience—or at least prolonging your exposure to public attention. Civil discovery can be an intrusive proposition, as the other side may be entitled to access and review private communications or documents that could relate to the subject of the lawsuit. This means that your emails, texts, and social media posts may be disclosed to the opposing party. Finally, litigation can be expensive, so you may wish to explore fee arrangements. Will your counsel take your case on a contingency basis, where they are awarded a percentage of fees if you are successful in getting money damages? Is the matter of such interest to them that they would consider representing you on a pro bono basis? What Else Can I Do to Protect Myself? Managing Abuse and Harassment on Social Media Online harassment of any kind can be extremely stressful. In addition to support that is available through your School or law enforcement, the following actions may help individuals respond to a difficult situation occurring online: Consider temporarily disabling your social media profiles or switching them to private. This will ensure that only your close connections can post or comment in your feed. Ignore the communications. Although your first instinct may be to respond and defend yourself online, responding to harassing messages can tend to prolong and inflame incidents. Often the objective of social media agitators is to elicit a response, which they can use to raise their profile still further. In addition, your response may provide more opportunity for harassment: i.e., the online abuser will find a way to mischaracterize, take out of context, and cast what you say in the worst possible light. Trolls may—but do not always—move on to other targets if you ignore them long enough. Stick to the facts. If you do feel that a response is necessary, try to adhere to the following guidelines: (1) stick to facts that are not open to interpretation; (2) keep your response short, concise, and above all factual; (3) correct inaccuracies and move on; (4) avoid adopting an aggressive or defensive tone and resist the temptation to “fight fire with fire.” Mute the attacker. Most social media platforms allow users to “mute” particular accounts. Muting another user means that user’s communications are not viewable to you. The muted party ordinarily is not notified that you have muted them and may still comment on your social media posts, but you will not need to see those comments. If you are worried a muted user’s comments may become threatening, ask a friend or colleague to check your feed on your behalf. Block the attacker. Several social media platforms allow you to “block” other accounts, meaning that they can longer follow you, see your posts, or comment on your content. Unless you have also muted the account, you will still be able to see a blocked user’s posts. Social media platforms ordinarily notify users when another account blocks them. Accordingly, they may choose to attack you elsewhere on the platform. Delisting from University Directories If you are concerned that online harassers can find you on campus or use your Harvard email or phone number to direct harmful communications to you, you may request that some or all of your personal information be removed from University directories. Students may adjust the settings for their profiles in Harvard directories by following these instructions. Faculty and staff can follow the instructions here. Note that University faculty and staff will need to provide a brief explanation for their request. Note: Members of the community should be aware that these instructions may not result in the delisting of all Harvard-related programs and activities. Reach out to your Harvard affiliations (academic department, extracurricular activities, etc.) if you wish to make a similar request. Requesting a FERPA Block Students may also direct their Schools not to disclose information that their Schools have designated as “directory information” under FERPA, the federal student privacy law. Under FERPA, Schools may disclose a student’s directory information to any person, unless the student opts out of such disclosures. Click here for more information about what qualifies as “directory information” here at Harvard. We call these opt-outs “FERPA blocks.” To institute a FERPA block, please contact your School’s Registrar’s Office.

Information Security,InCommon Certificate Manager FAQs,"InCommon Certificate Manager FAQs What is the InCommon Certificate Manager Service? The InCommon Certificate Service, created by and for the higher education community, provides unlimited SSL/TLS and client certificates for one low membership fee. This includes unlimited Organizational Validation (OV) SSL/TLS certificates, Extended Validation (EV) SSL/TLS certificates, client (or personal) certificates, and code-signing certificates. Do I have to use this service to create or manage my SSL Certificates? No. Although University schools and administrative units are encouraged to take advantage of the unlimited SSL Certificate service, these groups may use other Certificate Authorities (CA) for issuing SSL Certificate(s), if desired. Which domains are eligible for certificates? All hostnames within the harvard.edu domain are eligible for certificates through the enterprise InCommon agreement. How do I request access for myself or for a colleague? Please fill out the request form found here: https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=54fac1af1bb5bc105b1d3333cc4bcb53 Where can I find Certificate Manager user guides? View the https://sectigo.com/knowledge-base/product/admin_guides page for certificate manager documentation, including the Sectigo® Certificate Manager (SCM) Administrator's Guide I've been granted administrator access to the InCommon portal. What is my role and scope? Certificate administrators are granted the Department Registration Authority Officer (DRAO), which allows you to perform specific certificate management related duties scoped to domains or sub-domains associated with your department or organizational area. What if I need to transfer my DRAO role to someone else? If you are vacating your duties as the DRAO, or know of someone that is no longer in that position, contact ithelp@harvard.edu to updated. Can I assign a backup DRAO? Yes. It is highly recommended for business continuity that you have at least one designated backup certificate administrator for your department/organization. I'm having trouble logging in. How do I get user support? If you use Harvard Key for InCommon federated login, ensure that you are using your unique IdP URL and your federated credentials to log in. If your Harvard Key credentials have changed, account maintenance may be needed. For this or other login assistance book a HUIT Service Desk request for assistance. I am having trouble with InCommon. How do I get user support? HUIT does not directly support the InCommon/Sectigo Certificate manager platform. For product or technical support, book a helpdesk request directly with the vendor, following the on-page instructions for correct routing to either InCommon or to Sectigo. If the user support that you receive from the vendor does not resolve your issue, you may book a HUIT Service Desk ticket and request escalation assistance from HUIT. Is there an InCommon user community that I can join? Yes! The cert-users email list provides a forum for subscribers to the InCommon Certificate Service. List members share relevant information and can ask questions. Sign up here. What kind of turnaround time can I expect from InCommon? The information security concept of ""segregation of duties"" is enforced within InCommon for certain certificate management activities. What this means in practice is that some activities may be initiated by a DRAO but must be approved by a RAO or MRAO before the process can be completed. While most approval requests can be met within 24 business hours, the vendor guarantees a 48-72 business hour turnaround time on all certificate management requests. NOTE: Administrative approvals are not issued outside of normal business hours. Therefore, please plan accordingly. Why do I no longer see a three year renewal option for my certificates? In accordance with the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, effective March 1, 2018, Certificate Authorities (CAs) will no longer be able to issue SSL Certificates with a validity period longer than 27-months. Certificate FAQs Where can I re-download my certificate? Go to https://cert-manager.com/customer/InCommon/ssl?action=download You will be prompted for: Your Certificate ID (which was in the e-mail received when your certificate was issued) SSL certificate format desired (Binary, Base64) What are Wildcard certificates? A Wildcard SSL Certificate secures your Web site URL and an unlimited number of its sub-domains. The Wildcard SSL Certificate works the same way as a regular SSL certificate and undergoes the same validation processes. The difference is that the Wildcard SSL Certificate extends to all of the sub-domains of your domain that you want to secure. Are there any risk concerns on the use of Wildcard certificates? Yes. Wildcard certificates, when compromised by attackers, have the potential to be far more damaging to Harvard University and affiliate organizations than standard SSL certificates, since they could be used to spoof any host in the domain of the Wildcard. Placing copies of the Wildcard certificates and their accompanying keypairs on multiple machines also increases the attack surface of the certificates. What is an ""Intermediate"" Certificate? An intermediate certificate is the certificate(s) that go between your site (server) certificate and a root certificate. The intermediate certificate(s) completes the chain to a root certificate trusted by the browser. Using an intermediate certificate means that you must complete an additional step in the installation process to enable your site certificate to be chained to the trusted root, and not show errors in the browser when someone visits your web site. Can I get a certificate for a host in a non-harvard.edu domain? To ensure the University's compliance with the InCommon agreement, requests for certificates outside of harvard.edu domains are subject to extra vetting and approval, by both the University and possibly InCommon."
Information Security,Configure external storage media securely,"This guide is for Harvard FAS/CADM students, faculty, staff, contractors, and consultants with an active Harvard affiliation, who want to ensure the security of confidential and sensitive data on external storage media. Steps to take Storage Media Selection Use 256-Bit AES encrypted and PIN/password protected external hard drives, solid state drives (SSDs), USB, or flash keys. For data subject to international regulations, HIPAA, CUI, FCI, or L5 research data, select external storage media certified to meet FIPS 140-2/FIPS 140-3/FIPS 197 standards. Reference: NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program. Manage Passwords Store passwords and PINs in a reliable password manager to avoid loss. Be cautious, as loss of a password/PIN results in loss of access to your data. Note that certain encryption-enabled devices may auto-erase data after several failed attempts to access. Physical Security Keep physical possession of external devices and lock them when not in use. Protect devices from environmental conditions and shocks that might cause damage. Be sure to use the devices as per the manufacturer's instructions for optimal maintenance. Data Backups Regularly back up data to safeguard against device failure. Stay Updated and Upgrade Upgrade storage media as industry standards evolve or technology advances. Ensure that archival or legacy media containing confidential or sensitive data is securely managed according to its risk classification during its retention period. Secure Disposal Ensure the device is securely destroyed at the end of its lifecycle to prevent unauthorized access to data. Best Practices: Always ensure alignment with the latest industry standards and institutional guidelines for handling sensitive and/or confidential information. Regularly review and refresh protocols to maintain security. Get help Chat: Log in to chat live with a HUIT technician Submit a ticket Call: (617) 495-7777"
Information Security,How to create a strong password,"This guide is for Harvard students, faculty, staff, contractors, and consultants with an active Harvard affiliation, who would like to create a strong password. For more information about protecting systems and data, use the Information Security and Data Privacy team website. How to Create Strong Passwords & Passphrases Stay Safe with These Simple Tips Protecting your online accounts starts with a strong password. Fortunately, secure passwords don’t have to be complicated or hard to remember. By following a few best practices, you can create strong, memorable passphrases that keep your information safe. What Makes a Password Strong? A strong password or passphrase should meet these guidelines: Use both uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) Include at least one number (0-9) Add a symbol (such as !, #, or %) Be at least twelve characters long—the longer, the better! Passphrases with eighteen or more characters offer optimal protection. Avoid using personal details like birthdays, names, or common words—and never use “password” or any version of it. Tips for Creating a Memorable Passphrase Instead of using a hard-to-remember jumble of characters, you can create a passphrase from a series of random words. This is easy to remember and much harder for others to guess. Try this method: Pick four or five random letters as your guide (for example: C D F T). Create a phrase using words that start with those letters (e.g., Curious Dolphins Fly Together). Combine the words into a single passphrase: CuriousDolphinsFlyTogether (don’t use this exact example—make your own unique phrase). Add numbers or symbols if needed: Curious1Dolphins!FlyTogether Aim for length: The more characters you use (over 18 is ideal), the stronger your passphrase becomes. If you struggle to manage multiple passwords, consider using a password manager. Harvard community members have access to 1Password at no cost. Extra Security Steps Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Always turn on MFA for important accounts (like email, financial systems, and social media). MFA adds another layer of protection by requiring something you know (your password), and something you have (like your phone), or something you are (like a fingerprint or your face—called biometrics). Use biometrics if available: Many devices and apps now offer fingerprint or face recognition as part of their security. When combined with a password or passcode, biometrics make your accounts and devices even more secure and convenient. Keep passwords private: Never share your passwords with anyone. Official support services will never ask for your password by phone or email. Try a password manager: A password manager like 1Password can securely store all your passwords in one place. What About Phones, Tablets & Device Passcodes? Many smartphones, tablets, and computers use shorter PINs or passcodes for quick access. Here’s what you need to know: Shorter passcodes: Devices may allow 4-6 digit PINs. Choose random codes that aren’t easy to guess—avoid simple patterns like 123456 or your birthday. Biometric authentication: Most devices now support fingerprint scans or facial recognition. This makes it convenient to unlock your device securely, but you’ll still be asked for your passcode occasionally (for example, after restarting or if biometrics don’t work). Best practice: Enable biometric features when available, and set a strong, unique passcode as your backup. For any apps or accounts containing sensitive information (like banking or email), always use a strong, unique password or passphrase in addition to device-level security. University Standard If you are setting a password on a university system, always follow the official password and security policies about password complexity and password sharing (such as those required for HarvardKey or other university systems). By following these best practices, you’ll help keep your online accounts, devices, and personal information much more secure—easily and effectively!

Assignments: The delegate can view and work on tickets assigned to you. Tickets assigned to you will appear in your delegate’s “My Work” queues. CC notifications: The delegate receives a copy of email notifications sent to you, except those marked Meeting Invitation. Meeting invitations: The delegate receives a copy any meeting invitations sent to you by the ServiceNow system (for example Change calendar invitations). Click Save or Submit to enter your changes. Save will record the transaction and keep you on the same form, while Submit will save the Delegate record and transfer you back to the main navigation form. Things to keep in mind Be sure delegates know up-front that they are assuming responsibility while you’re away. Delegates should only be active system users. You may delegate different responsibilities to different people. It is important to note that delegation is NOT system retroactive. Delegates do not own your tickets or approvals, delegates work on your behalf while you retain ownership of those records. Users to whom you delegate responsibility see all pending tasks and approvals regardless of the delegation period. Delegation does not cascade. When a user acts as a delegate for another user, the delegate cannot in turn delegate to a third party. The original delegate is the only user who receives assignments and notifications. Need help? If you need help setting a delegate in ServiceNow, submit a ticket to ITSM."

IT Provider Services,HUIT Change Management: What are the key components of a change request ticket?,"QUESTION: What are the key components of a change request ticket? ANSWER: The key components of a change request ticket are lifecycle, planning, and the implementation rating. Lifecycle: Initiate - Initiate a ServiceNow Change Request ticket. Assess - Determine change type and assess Risk as necessary Assign - Identify Services and Configuration Items potentially affected. Develop and document Implementation, Communications, Testing, and Backout plans. Schedule - Identify responsible support group and assignee. Submit - Submit the change request for approval as necessary. Implement - Initiate the communications plan as necessary and implement the change. Complete - Complete the Change Request ticket and additional tasks as necessary Planning: All Change Requests require a detailed accounting of all services impacted or potentially impacted by the change implementation, and the degree to which their functionality will be affected or interrupted. Include any change or impact to the user experience. Communications Plan: All Change Requests require that communications be addressed. At a minimum, the following questions need to be answered by the communications plan for each Change Request, unless no communications are necessary: Who is the target audience? What is the message? What is the notification method? When will notification(s) be sent? Back-out Plan: All Change Requests require that back-out measures be addressed. A plan summary should be included in the Change Request ticket. Back-out plans should seek to minimize organizational impact of a failed Change. When possible, it is beneficial to predefine a “trigger” condition that initiates the back-out plan, or identify a specific point in the implementation timeline at which a back-out decision is made. In circumstances in which no back- out plan is feasible, every effort should be made to mitigate the potential risk of organizational impact if the change is unsuccessful. The primary accountability for defining and, if necessary, engaging a back-out plan resides with the requester or implementer of an individual Change Request, or of the project with which the Change Request is associated. Testing Plan: All Change Requests require that testing be addressed. Change Management is responsible for confirming that a test plan, where feasible, exists. As a rule, testing should be conducted whenever possible; it may include functional, QA, and user acceptance testing, or other testing as appropriate. Additionally, testing should be conducted as possible after a change has taken place as part of a typical implementation plan to ensure that impacted services are fully functional. Ideally, the following information should be included in the Change Request ticket: Staff member(s) responsible for testing Dates during which testing occurred Details of testing environment, as appropriate Outcome of testing, with details as appropriate Implementation Rating: Upon completion, all Changes receive an Implementation Rating that assesses the overall quality of the change implementation. The change is rated using the following criteria: Rating (→) Successful Problems Encountered Change Failed Criteria (↓) Rollback Unnecessary True True False No Unplanned Service Interruption True Either Is False N/A Completed All Work Within Change Window True False N/A The Implementation Rating should be documented in the Change Request ticket, with additional information attached as necessary to provide details that explain the reason for the rating."

IT Provider Services,"HUIT Change Management: When is Change ""Freeze""?","QUESTION: When is Change ""Freeze""? ANSWER: To ensure the availability of services when they are most critical, the Change Management process adheres closely to the academic calendar. The weeks surrounding term startup events have been identified as “change freeze periods” – time periods during which additional caution and scrutiny of changes are warranted. During term startup change freeze, no significant changes to critical services or major project deployments should be scheduled. Exceptions are permitted with approval from at least three of five operational Managing Directors. For each term startup event, HUIT identifies services considered critical to the success of Startup. The overall list of critical services is focused on, but not limited to, services that are essential to: on-boarding students, faculty and staff, course delivery, communications and support. Change Freeze Periods Business Event Event Duration Event Start Event End Fall Term Startup 4 weeks Monday 2 weeks prior to first week of classes Friday 1 week after first week of classes Spring Term Startup 2 weeks Monday 1 week prior to first week of classes Friday of first week of classes Summer Term Startup 2 weeks Monday before move-in weekend Friday of first week of classes HUIT's Change Freeze periods and Major Maintenance Windows schedule are determined per Harvard's academic calendar and they are published in ServiceNow under Change > Business Events (through 2025). Purpose of Change ""Freeze"" Provide a smooth academic term start-up experience for students, faculty, and staff Ensure availability of academic and supporting services when they are most critical (e.g., HarvardKey and Wireless Networking) Focus staff time and effort on service delivery (vs. firefighting) at times of increased activity during academic year Supersede regular maintenance windows In Scope Out of Scope Applications and services deemed critical for Term Start-up (Enterprise) Release Management* No high-risk changes No major project deployments *Enterprise releases are planned based on business partners’ calendars Term Startup Exception Guidelines Exception requests should be made via email to Patricia Boyle-McKenna, Emily Bottis, Steph Gumble, Jason Shaffner, and Courtney Harwood using the change freeze exception mailing list (and the exception request template per KB0013586).

IT Provider Services,Application Authorization using HarvardKey and Grouper,"Please note: Harvard will be retiring support for CAS in 2026 and will stop accepting requests to integrate with HarvardKey using the CAS protocol effective October 1, 2024. Web applications using the CAS or SAML protocols that register with HarvardKey for SSO are also provided with some level of default authorized access. Implemented by applying an Application Authorization Filter in the application’s HarvardKey registration. See below for more details. Can alleviate the need for applications to implement authorization measures, as it is all done by HarvardKey, or it can be an initial layer of authorization on top of authorization done by the application itself. Is specified by application owners in their HarvardKey Application Integration Registration Form with additional consulting if necessary. An optional Group MemberOf Attribute Release may also be requested in the HarvardKey registration, which provides a person’s group membership information via the CAS/SAML assertion response when they log into the application. This group information can be used by the application to assign finer grain authorization (e.g., admin permissions). See below for more details. How an Application Authorization Filter works with HarvardKey An application authorization filter is a single group in Grouper containing individuals who are authorized to access the application. Policy Note: Newly integrated or updated applications with HarvardKey are required to use an Application Authorization Filter unless an exception is granted by IAM. The Grouper group name is included in an application’s HarvardKey registration. After HarvardKey authenticates a user, it checks to see if the person is in the Grouper group. If they are in the group, then HarvardKey passes the user onto the application, where the application itself may have additional authorization in place. If they are not in the group, then HarvardKey issues a Sign In error message ""User is not assigned to this application."" Application owners may request that HarvardKey directs users to an alternate error page hosted by the application. Types of Application Authorization Filters Each application integrated with HarvardKey has only one Application Authorization Filter which can be either a generic authorization filter, or an application-specific authorization filter. Generic Authorization Filters General purpose groups that can be used by multiple applications for authorization. May include affiliations across the university that align with affiliation and assurance tiers, or be specific to a school or unit. Auto-updated daily from an authoritative source of data, because they are populated using Grouper reference groups. Can be viewed by Grouper users in the harvard:apps:hkey-authz folder. Can be viewed by others on the IAM site - HarvardKey Generic Authorization Filters Additional generic filters may be requested by application owners by emailing iam_help@harvard.edu Application-specific Authorization Filters Contains people that are to access a specific application. Resides in a school or department’s apps folder in the harvard:org structure. Can only be viewed by the school/departments delegated group administrators or group membership managers. Appropriate to use when a generic filter cannot be used, such as when: Access is limited to a custom list of people Access requires people added individually by name, in addition to reference groups Access is a mix of specific schools and departments across the university Created by Grouper delegated group administrators, or with assistance from IAM, according to a documented convention. Request assistance by emailing iam_help@harvard.edu See Understand application-specific authorization filters in Grouper for more details. Optional Group MemberOf Attribute Release An Application may request the Group MemberOf Attribute Release in their HarvardKey Application Integration Registration Form. Provides a person’s group membership information via the CAS/SAML assertion response when they log into the application. Usually used by the application to assign finer grain authorization (e.g., admin permissions). Never returns all the Grouper groups a person is a member of. Is limited to the groups in a specific folder, usually the folder where the Application-specific authorization filter is. Suggested convention is to start the group with “role-”.

IT Provider Services,Guide to create and administer managed Grouper groups,"These instructions are a self-paced training guide for people who want to become a Delegated Group Administrator in Grouper, or as a refresher for those who have already taken the training. It contains links to Grouper knowledge articles (KBs) on the IT Help Portal that guide you on how to become proficient with the basic Grouper features. After completing the training you are eligible to become a delegated group administrator for your school or department by Requesting access to Grouper. There are two parts to the training: Create and administer managed Grouper groups (covering in this KB) Create application authorization filters in Grouper It is expected that you fully read each linked knowledge article and follow the tasks below in sequence to progress logically through your training. Access Grouper Email iam_help@harvard.edu and request access to Grouper for training purposes. You will be granted access to Grouper for 3 months in the harvard:training:practice folder where you will perform the steps in this guide. Important! Your access to the Grouper platform requires that you understand the Harvard Information Security Policy as level 3 data is visible within the application. Navigate folders and groups Read Understanding different Grouper group types. Log into Grouper Use the Navigate groups and folders in Grouper KB to explore the groups that you are able to see and to perform the next tasks. Navigate to a folder and view its information. Navigate to a reference group and view its information. Click on a person in the reference group to view their Information. Find a reference group that has over 50 people and navigate to the last page of members. Search for yourself using your HUID Search for HUIT reference groups by typing “ref: huit” in the search box. Note the space between ref: and huit. Create and edit a folder Use the Create, edit, delete groups and folders in Grouper KB for instructions on how to perform the following tasks: Navigate to the harvard:training:practice folder. Create a new folder in the harvard:training:practice folder. Name it using your first name, followed by a dash, and your last name, in all lowercase. Give it a description. Edit the folder Change the Folder name to your first name, followed by a space, and your last name, using initial capital letters. This is a more readable display name for the folder. The same thing can be done for groups. Modify the description to include today’s date, in any format. Show details about the folder. Create another folder within your training folder, and then delete it. Create a managed group A managed group is a custom, or ad hoc, group created as necessary by delegated group administrators for a particular purpose. Use these KBs for instructions on how to perform the following tasks: Create, edit, delete groups and folders in Grouper Add and remove people in Grouper groups Add and remove people in bulk to Grouper groups using import Navigate to your harvard:training:practice folder. Create a folder called “managed” within your training folder, with the description “Folder for the creation of managed groups pertaining to (your name).” Note - by convention we create managed groups in a folder called “managed” Create a group called “members-my-team” within your managed folder, with the description “A group containing members of my team, before removing inactive members.” Add yourself to the group, plus some of your colleagues, and several people outside of your organization. Add them to your group using their name, email or HUID. Show and then hide details about your group. Import additional members to your group using a list of HUIDs or NetIDs, or a .csv file containing them. Create another group within your managed folder, and then delete it. Add people from another group to your group Use the Add and remove people in Grouper groups KB for instructions on how to perform the following tasks: Navigate to your “members-my-team” managed group. Add the reference group “HUIT Employees” by entering “ref: huit employees” in the Member name or ID: field and select “harvard:ref:affiliations:ca:huit:employees:HUIT Employees” from the list. Note the space after ref: and huit in your entry. This will add approx. 700+ indirect members to your group. Scroll to the bottom of the member list to see how many people are in the group. Search for yourself in the group. Filter for direct members of the group. Remove one of your colleagues from the group. Remove the HUIT Employees reference group from the group. Create a composite group If a managed group contains people listed by name, you want to ensure that the managed group is automatically updated whenever the affiliation of a person in the group becomes inactive. To do this, create a composite group which intersects the “members-” group with either a reference or a bundled group. The resultant membership of the composite group are individuals who exist in both groups, and since reference and bundled group only contain members with a current affiliation (e.g. student), once anyone in the “members-” group becomes non-current (e.g. they graduate) they will automatically be removed from the composite group. Use the Create composite groups in Grouper KB for instructions on how to perform the following tasks: Create a group called “my-team” within your managed folder, with the description “A group containing members of my team, after removing inactive members.” Create a composite group using the intersection operation: Select your “members-my-team” group as the first factor. Select a reference group that contains employees in your school or organization for the second factor (e.g. harvard:ref:affiliations:ca:huit:employees:HUIT Employees). View the first and second factors, and the membership of the composite group. Compare the members of your “my-team” composite group to the original list of members in your “members-my-team” group. Note: you can duplicate the grouper tab on your browser to make this side by side comparison easier. Notice that in your “my-team” composite group that any members that were not also a member of your second factor reference group have been removed. Edit the composite group and change the second factor to a reference group that has either a broader or smaller population Compare the memberships again of your “my-team” and “members-my-team” groups. Remove the composite on the group. What's next Join the IAM Group Services Announcement List View the Getting Started with Grouper KB and browse the list of other Grouper Knowledge Articles.

IT Provider Services,Guide to create application authorization filters in Grouper,"These instructions are for school/department Delegated Group Administrators who are looking to create and manage application authorization filters in Grouper for their applications that use HarvardKey. Conventions The instructions below follow the IAM conventions to use when creating authorization filters. Please follow these conventions unless your application has requirements that warrant a customized setup. IAM is available for consultation or to review your application authorization filter. Send requests to iam_help@harvard.edu Create an application folder Navigate to your school or department's apps folder in Grouper. If none exists then create a folder called “apps” in your school/department’s folder in the “harvard:org” hierarchy. By convention all application authorization filters should be in your apps folder. Create the application-specific folder. Use the application name as the folder name and ID, according to the following Grouper naming convention: All lowercase alphanumeric characters. Separate application words with a hyphen (e.g. survey-tool). Do not use spaces or any other special characters. Use the following description for the application folder. Omit the brackets and substitute your application’s information. A folder containing authorization filter groups for the [my-app] application. Contact is [app contact name]. [ServiceNow INC Ticket #] Note: the ServiceNow INC ticket number is usually the ticket used to request the application registration and has the HarvardKey Application Registration attached. Create the application authorization filter groups Use the naming conventions, composite requirements and sample descriptions in these instructions when creating the application authorization filter groups. Substitute your application name for [my-app] and omit the brackets. See Understand application-specific authorization filters in Grouper for more information about these groups. In the application folder create the members-users group. Name it members-users-[my-app] Use the description: People who are intended to access the [my-app] application, before removing any inactive or excluded users. This is the group that application owners will edit in Grouper in order to add/remove people from their final authorized-users group filter. It will be used later in the eligible-users group. In the members-users-[my-app] group add people, and/or IAM reference, bundle or other managed groups containing the user population intended to access the application. In the application folder create the eligible-users group. Name it eligible-users-[my-app] Use the description: People who are intended to access the [my-app] application, after removing any inactive users. It will be used later in the authorized-users group. Make the eligible-users-[my-app] group a composite intersection group. Use the members-users-[my-app] group as the First factor group. Select the “and (intersection)” operation. For the Second factor group, select an appropriate reference or bundle group that contains a superset of the population intended to access the application. Since reference and bundle groups contain only those with an active Harvard affiliation, intersecting the members-users-[my-app] group with them ensures that only those with an active Harvard affiliation will remain in the eligible-users-[my-app] group. In the application folder create the authorized-users group. Name it authorized-users-[my-app] Use the description: People who are intended to access the [my-app] application, after removing any inactive or excluded users. This is the final group of people who are authorized to access the application and is considered the application authorization filter. It is used in the application’s HarvardKey registration to control access via the HarvardKey group authorization service. Make the authorized-users-[my-app] group a composite complement group. Use the eligible-users-[my-app] as the First factor group. Select the “not (complement) (minus)” operation. For the Second factor group, enter the university excluded users group “etc:excluded-users”. This composite removes access for persons as determined by the HUIT Information Security and Data Privacy Office which is required by policy for all application authorization filters. When submitting your HarvardKey Application Integration Registration Form. Include the full ID path of the authorized-users-[my-app] group in the User Authorization section. Create an optional excluded users group if needed If you require excluding specific individuals or groups from accessing an application, then create an excluded users group that is specific to the application as instructed below. In the application folder create an excluded-users group. Name it excluded-users-[my-app] Use the description: People who are excluded from accessing the [my-app] application. As per IAM policy, this group should include the university excluded users group. Add the university excluded users group “etc:excluded-users” as a member of the excluded-users-my-app group. Add any other people or groups who should be excluded from accessing the application as members of the excluded-users-my-app group. Edit the composite in the authorized-users-[my-app] group. For the Second factor group, replace the university excluded users group with the excluded-users-my-app group.

IT Provider Services,Understand Grouper department reference groups,"This article is for Delegated Group Administrators and Group Membership Managers looking to utilize Grouper reference groups based on Harvard HR Department affiliations for employees or Harvard Sponsored Roles. About department reference groups Read-only Grouper groups managed by HUIT. Available to all Grouper users. Employee and Sponsored Role groups for each of the ~3,500 active HR departments. Each group is a rollup of all individuals within the department and any of its sub-departments. Includes only those with an active Harvard Employee or Sponsored Role affiliation. Dynamically updated daily from an authoritative source of data. Partitioned into top level folders for each school/unit, such as CADM, FAS, HLS, etc. School/unit folders also have a rollup group for each Employee Classification and most Harvard Sponsored Role types. Used as building blocks for inclusion in other groups, providing group owners flexibility in defining their group populations. Browse department reference groups Navigate to the harvard:ref:dept folder using the navigation pane, and click on it to bring it up in the main window. See Navigate groups and folders in Grouper if you are unfamiliar with how to generally navigate within Grouper. Click the employees folder to browse the employee department reference groups. Click the sponsored folder to browse the Harvard Sponsored Roles department reference groups. Beneath the employee and sponsored folders are folders for each of the top level schools/units, such as CADM, FAS, and HLS. Click on the school/unit folder to view all the department reference groups for that school/unit. In the employees folder, each school/unit folder also has an empl-class folder. Click on it to view groups containing a rollup of all active employees in that school/unit for each HR employee classification, such as Admin & Professional, Support Staff, and Senior Faculty. In the sponsored folder, each school/unit folder also has a role-type folder. Click on it to view groups containing a rollup of all people in that tub that have an active Harvard Sponsored Role for most Sponsored Role role types, such as Consultant, Contingent Worker and Collaborator. Department reference group naming conventions Employee department reference group names begin with EMPL- Harvard Sponsored Role department reference group names begin with HSR- Following EMPL- or HSR- is the school/unit acronym, such as CADM, FAS, or HLS, followed by an underscore character (e.g., EMPL-HLS_, or HSR-HLS_). Following the school/unit acronym is the short version of the HR department name followed by a dash and then the department ID (e.g., EMPL-HLS_Clinical Prog-100593). The long version of the HR department name, which is more descriptive, is included in the reference group description. For sub-departments, any parent departments in the HR department hierarchy are part of the group name, separated by an underscore character (e.g., EMPL-HLS_Clinical Prog_Clinical Prog Admin-100592). In this example the “Clinical Prog Admin” department is a sub-department of “Clinical Prog”. This convention informs the user as to where the sub-department exists within the HR hierarchy. Search department reference groups Use the Grouper search bar to search for department reference groups using a variety of methods: By Partial Department Name: Limit your search to just the department reference groups by entering ref:dept: followed by a space, and then enter all or part of the department name, such as “ref:dept: campus services”. (Note: folders in Grouper are separated by colons.) In this example the search will return all department reference groups containing the words campus or services in their name or description. Further limit to just departments in a specific tub by adding the tub folder followed by a colon and a space to the search criteria, such as “ref:dept: CADM: campus services”. By Full Department Name: Cut and paste the department specified in various Harvard sources, such as the Harvard Web Directory, into the Grouper search bar (e.g., CADM^HUIT^TPS^IAM) Since descriptions of department reference groups contain the department short and long names, including the carat characters, these groups are returned in the search results. The search will return both the employee and the Harvard Sponsored role department reference groups. By Department ID: Quickly find a single department’s reference groups by entering the six character department ID (e.g., 100593).

IT Provider Services,Request a dynamic Grouper group for use in M365 SharePoint access,"These instructions are for SharePoint users who are looking to use dynamic Grouper groups to manage access to SharePoint. Dynamic Grouper groups contain reference and bundle groups that are updated daily based on current affiliation information from systems of record, helping departments automate changes to access privileges as a person’s role changes over time. Some examples of dynamic groups are all employees in a specific department, all faculty and students in a specific school, or all paid employees across the University. As individuals are added to a group (e.g., a new employee in a department) they gain access to all resources granted to that group. Similarly as individuals leave a group (e.g., an employee is terminated or transfers), access is removed from resources granted to that group. These dynamic groups are selectable in SharePoint and may be used to control access to sites, folders, and files. The group names begin with DYN and as such are easily searchable in the M365 people picker (e.g. DYN All Admin and Professional Employees). Any Dynamic group is visible and selectable by any M365 user. See ""Grant SharePoint access to a dynamic group"" KB for instructions. Before submitting a request Look to see if there is an existing dynamic group in M365 SharePoint that meets your needs. Review available reference and bundle groups in Grouper, to see if they meet your population criteria. Check with your local Grouper administrators to find out who has current access to Grouper. Consider your group’s size. Requested groups should contain 10 or more individuals. To submit a request Use this request form to request a Grouper group for use in M365 SharePoint access. The request requires the following information: School / Business Unit Department How do you plan to use the group(s)? What specific populations would you like included (e.g. students, class participants, employees, faculty, staff, Harvard Sponsored Roles, alumni)? What specific schools or departments is the population limited to, if any? Are there existing reference or bundle groups in Grouper that meet your population needs? If Yes, please note the reference or bundle groups. Do you have a deadline to have the group(s) in place (e.g., launch date for new site)? After submitting your request you will be given an estimate for the creation of the new dynamic group(s).

IT Provider Services,Quick Guide to Creating a Library Borrower in MIDAS,"DESCRIPTION: Guide to Creating a Library Borrower in MIDAS Click here for the Guide (PDF) This guide describe the steps for a MIDAS user to on-board a new library borrower or to renew a patron’s library borrower privileges as of the MIDAS 3.7.0 release, and ensures that patrons can use their permanent HUID and ID card for library access and borrowing activities. It applies to all library borrower types including special borrowers, research assistants, and library donors. All MIDAS users who on-board and manage library borrowers of any type should familiarize themselves with the process described in this Guide so that the use of HUIDs beginning with 02 will phase out as library patrons renew their borrowing privileges. This diagram summarizes the revised library borrower process which is explained step-by-step in the guide. Need help? This guide is meant to be a self-service document requiring no additional training, however if you have questions or suggestions please email IAM_help@harvard.edu"
IT Provider Services,Getting Started with Change Management at HUIT,"QUESTION: What is Change Management? ANSWER: HUIT, like any IT organization, has to make changes to its applications and infrastructure. Change Management reduces the risk of those changes by creating standardized methods and procedures that are effective (ensuring the necessary analysis, planning, coordination, testing and documentation to reduce risk) as well as efficient (provide the necessary benefit as quickly and simply as possible). Objectives: Establish a standard change management process and tool for all HUIT changes Ensure that approvals are aligned with risk level Support successful internal and external communications Capture metrics and lessons learned to continuously improve the Change Management process Scope: Change Management begins when the need for the change is identified, not when it is ready to be implemented. Requesting review and approval of changes early provides for: Better visibility, prioritization and planning More realistic impact analysis and resource allocation Reduced delays and rework Improved communication For more information, see KB0012679 ""HUIT Change Management: What does ""scope"" mean?"" Roles and Responsibilities: There are three main roles: the Change Requestor, Change Implementer, and Assignment Group Approver. The Change Requestor is the person submitting and owning the Change Request, the Change Implementer/Assignee implements and monitors the change, and the manager (or designee) of the functional group implements the change. For more information, see KB0012680 ""HUIT Change Management: What are the roles and responsibilities of those in change management?"" Change Types There are four different change types, each with different criteria and requirements. They are as follows: Pre-Approved (Standard) Normal Emergency Major For more information see KB0012681 ""HUIT Change Management: What are the different change types?"" Change Request Key Components The key components that make up a change request are lifecycle, planning, and the implementation rating. Lifecycle is the full process that is done in order to complete a change request ticket. Planning is a key component before beginning the lifecycle process that evaluates the potential impact of the ticket. The implementation rating is an evaluation of the success of the change after it is done. For more information, see KB0012682 ""HUIT Change Management: What are the key components of a change request ticket?"" Change Freeze and Term Startup Exception Guidelines During term startup change freeze, no significant changes to critical services or major project deployments should be scheduled. Exceptions are permitted with approval from at least three of five operational Managing Directors. For more information on Change Freeze Periods, see KB0010641 (public) ""HUIT Change Management: When is Change ""Freeze""?"" For more information on Exception Guidelines and services considered critical to term start up, see KB0013586 (internal) ""HUIT Change Management: What are Change Freeze and Term Startup Exception Guidelines?"" Business Events & Maintenance Windows In addition to Change Freeze, HUIT teams are encouraged to exercise Heightened Sensitivity when implementing changes during semester Reading and Exam Periods, and Commencement activities in May. HUIT observes four Major Maintenance Windows to perform necessary updates to Harvard’s IT systems, times when we expect IT services may not be available. Unless noted otherwise, these time frames apply to all services: Change Freeze Periods Heightened Sensitivity Major Maintenance Fall Startup (4 weeks) Reading & Exam Periods Severity 3 (6-hour Window) Spring & Summer Startup (2 weeks) Commencement Severity 2 (12-hour Window) Severity 1 (18-hour Window) For more information on HUIT's Major Maintenance Windows, see KB0013877 (internal) ""HUIT Change Management: When are HUIT's Maintenance Windows?"" HUIT's Change Freeze periods and Major Maintenance Windows schedule are determined per Harvard's academic calendar and they are published in ServiceNow under Change > Business Events."
IT Provider Services,Add and remove people in Grouper groups,"These instructions are for Delegated Group Administrators or Group Membership Managers who are looking to add and remove people in groups in the Grouper application. Add a person to a group Navigate to or search for your group in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. On the Members tab, click the +Add members button. In the Member name or ID: box enter the first and last name of the person you want to add to the group. You will see spinning ellipses as Grouper searches, and then a list of one or more matches. Do not press the “enter” button on your keyboard after typing the name. If you do then Grouper will give a “No matches found” error message. If this happens, simply backspace over the last character in the name and type it again to restart the search. The match list shows the person’s preferred name, official email address, NetID, HUID, and other unique identifiers. Use this information to select the correct person from the list. People who have left Harvard will normally not display an email address. Keep the Default privileges selected. To automatically start or end a person’s membership in the group at a future date, enter it in the Start date: and End date: boxes. If left blank, the person’s membership will start immediately and end when they are removed from the group. Use the format of yyyy/mm/dd hh:mi am/pm for the date and time. The expected time zone is Eastern Time (ET). E.g., enter 2022/10/12 9:00 AM, for October twelfth 2022 at 9 o’clock AM Eastern Time. Click the Add button to add the person as a member of your group. Repeat this process to add additional people as members of the group. A person’s HUID, NetID, email or just a portion of their name can also be entered in the Member name or ID: box to start a search. View people added to the group in the Members tab. People added to your group in this way will show as having a Direct Membership in your group. Click the +Add members button again to close the Add members section.

The tab will list only members that match. Note: You can only search for members of the group by their name, not their HUID or NetID. Their name is their Preferred Name in the IAM Identity Registry. To view only members that have a direct membership in your group, go to the Filter for: dropdown on the Members tab, and select Has direct membership, then click the Apply filter button. This is useful if there are many people in your group that were added indirectly as part of another group. Filtering for only direct memberships will show the group, or groups, that indirectly added all the people.

IT Provider Services,Format fonts and images in knowledge articles,"This guide is for anyone authorized to edit articles in the HUIT Knowledge Base. For a full guide detailing spelling, abbreviations, and preferred terminology, see the HUIT Style Guide on the HUIT Intranet. Format text Always apply a template by selecting an Article Type. This automatically adds the sections you'll need, in the correct styles. If you need to add additional sections with headings, follow these guidelines: Do not use Heading 1; it is reserved for the short description (article title). Use Heading 2 for top-level headers (e.g. ""Getting started""). Use Heading 3 and subsequent headings for next level headers (i.e. subsections). The short description field is your title. Don't replicate the short description in the article body. Write the short description in Sentence case. Capitalize the first word, and any proper nouns. Use the default font. In the editor, don't change the Font Family or Font Sizes. Your entire article should be set as ""Paragraph,"" except for any headings. Use the default font color. Don't add color to the text or its background. Use B (bold) text when describing interactions in instructions, like button titles or tabs to click. Don't copy content directly into the article body from another website or word processing software. Instead, first copy it into a plain text editor and then copy and paste it from the text editor into the article body. This will clear all unintended formatting.

IT Provider Services,How to add groups and permissions to Azure AD on the Soliant FileMaker Servers,"Azure AD user authentication can be added to FileMaker databases hosted on the Soliant servers. This allows authorized users to login to their FileMaker databases using their Harvard Key email address and password. How it Works HUIT and Soliant Consulting register each FileMaker Server with the Harvard University Azure AD system. After this work has been done, users can add the Azure AD user groups and access rights to each of their databases. The conversion from FileMaker user accounts to Harvard Key accounts is usually done in several steps. A department's FileMaker admins add the appropriate Azure user groups and permissions to each database, as described in this document. In conjunction with HUIT and Soliant Consulting, the Azure group access is tested. When all testing is completed for all users of the FileMaker server, Azure AD logins to the FileMaker databases is enabled. Preparation for Azure AD Authentication The first step in preparing for the Azure AD integration is to decide which users should have what level of access to each of your databases. For each of your database files, please prepare up to three lists of users: • Admin Full Access Required Can modify the databases, select users and privileges. Full read-write access to data • Read/Write Optional Full read-write access to the data. • Read-Only Optional Can open the database and can read the data. If any of your FileMaker databases require different sets of users and permissions, you will need to prepare the user lists for each database file. Maintenance of Users and Privileges From time-to-time you may need to add or remove users from your FileMaker databases' user groups. To do this, submit a ticket to HUIT. Add Azure AD to FileMaker Databases The following steps need to be done to every FileMaker database your group uses. The process is not complicated, but it needs to be done carefully. Requirement: The person making the changes must have [Full Access] privileges to the FileMaker database being changed. If there are no known Full Access users for your database, Soliant Consulting may be able to help. STEP 1: THE MANAGE SECURITY WINDOW Using FileMaker Pro, open your FileMaker database file. Select File > Manage > Security When the Manage Security opens, make sure the [Guest] and the Admin account are both unchecked. Next, click on the Authenticate via menu. Choose Microsoft Azure AD STEP 2: ADD THE AZURE AD GROUPS AND PRIVILEGES In the FileMaker Manage Microsoft Azure AD view, you will add one Azure AD User Group at a time for each of your databases. HUIT will give you • an Azure AD User Group Name (for example: HUIT-FileMaker-mygroup-ReadWrite-dgs) • an Azure AD User Group ID (for example: f7716a6e-1fb1-4e80-b680-a444-2b) You will need to add this information to your databases. Press the [+New] button to add a new User Group and privileges. Enter data in the right side of the window as shown above. Click [x] Group and [x] Active. Put the Group ID you are given into the Group Name (Object ID) field. Put the Group Name into the Description field. Set the Privilege Set field to the correct privileges for that group Press [OK] when finished. Repeat these three steps for each User Group to be added to this database. After each User Group has been added, continue to STEP 3 on the next page for this database. STEP 3: MAKE ""FILE OPTIONS"" CHANGES Now, open the File Options window. File > File Options Uncheck the ""Log in using"" and the ""Show sign-in fields"" boxes. Other fields do not need to be changed. When complete, press [OK]. STEP 4: NOW REPEAT FOR EACH DATABASE FILE This completes the changes for this particular FileMaker database file. Repeat STEP 1 through STEP 4 for each of your FileMaker database files. Login to a FileMaker Database with Azure AD Authentication When the FileMaker Server and your FileMaker databases have been configured to use Azure AD authentication, the normal FileMaker login window will change. Press the [ Microsoft] button. This will lead to the familiar Harvard Key login screens. Enter your Harvard Key credentials. FileMaker Pro will open your FileMaker database(s) with the privilege set you specified for this user's group."

IT Provider Services,Understand application-specific authorization filters in Grouper,"This information is for Delegated Group Administrators who are looking to create an application authorization filter in Grouper that is specific to their application. Application authorization filters An application-specific authorization filter is a single group in Grouper containing individuals who are authorized to access a specific web application using HarvardKey. Any web application using the HarvardKey group authorization service will have either an application-specific authorization filter or use a HarvardKey generic authorization filter which multiple applications can use. The name of the authorization filter group in Grouper is used in the HarvardKey registration for the application. Simply put, if a person is a member of the application-specific authorization filter, or the generic authorization filter group, then HarvardKey will grant them access to the application when they log in using their HarvardKey. Application-specific authorization filter Grouper delegated administrators may create their own application-specific authorization filters in Grouper following the Guide to Setup Application Authorization Groups in Grouper, and IAM can assist as needed by emailing iam_help@harvard.edu Application-specific authorization filter groups As per IAM convention, the Authorized User group is a final resultant group which is derived from three other application authorization groups within Grouper. The following explains the set of Application Authorization Groups and how they are used to derive the final Authorized Users group. Members Users Group – this group contains the raw list of people, and/or IAM reference, bundle or other managed groups who are the intended users of the application, before removing any inactive and excluded users. This is the group that application owners will edit in Grouper in order to add/remove people from their final Authorized Users group. It will be used by the Eligible Users group. The form of the Members Users group name is “members-users-”. Eligible Users Group – this group is created as a Grouper composite group which intersects the Members Users group with an IAM Reference group. The result is a group with only members that have an active Harvard affiliation, as defined by the Reference Group that is used in the composite (e.g. All Employees). Any people listed in the Members Users group whose Harvard affiliation ends will automatically be removed from the Eligible Users group when the Reference group is updated daily from the IAM Identity Registry. The Eligible Users group is not normally edited by the application owner, unless the intersecting Reference group needs to be changed. It will be used in the final Authorized User group. The form of the Eligible Users group name is “eligible-users-”. Excluded Users Group – this group contains a list of people who are excluded from accessing the application. The membership list includes the University Excluded Users group which enables immediate termination of access to all applications for persons as determined by the security office. This Excluded Users group is rarely edited by the application owner unless extenuating circumstances warrants adding someone to immediately prohibit their access to the application. It will be used in the final Authorized User group. The form of the Excluded Users group name is “excluded-users-”. Authorized Users Group – this is the final group of people who are authorized to access the application. It is created as a Grouper composite group which subtracts the Excluded Users group from the Eligible Users group. The Authorized Users group should not be edited by the application owner since it is resultant group derived from the other three application authorization groups described above. It is used by the HarvardKey AuthorizationFilterAttribute option for controlling access to applications through the HarvardKey group authorization service. The form of the Authorized Users group name is “authorized-users-”. Application-specific authorization filter location in Grouper As per IAM convention, all of the application authorization filter groups for a specific application, including the Authorized Users group, should exist in an application-specific folder in Grouper which is named for the application. Since a school or department may be responsible for multiple applications, all their application folders should exist beneath a folder named ""apps"" which exists somewhere beneath their school or department folder hierarchy in Grouper.

IT Provider Services,Create a CSV file of members of a Grouper group using export,"These instructions are for Delegated Group Administrators or Group Membership Managers who are looking to create a .csv file of all members of a Grouper group. This can be useful in comparing Grouper group memberships to group lists in other systems. Export members of a Grouper group into a .csv file Navigate to or search for your group in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. Click the Group actions button and select Export members from the dropdown. In the What data would you like to export option, select All member data. Click the Export button. Grouper will export the group membership into a .csv file called “groupExportAll_” followed by your group name. Clean-up the .csv file to just members of the group These instructions are for Microsoft Excel, but other spreadsheet tools could also be used. Open the .csv file that was created by the Grouper export in Microsoft Excel. If your group contains other groups in its membership, then the group names will be included in the export. These groups will list first in the spreadsheet and the first column will have g:gsa as the sourceID. Delete these rows if any exist. Delete all columns except column E, which has the heading “description”. Delete the first row, which has the column heading. All that should remain is a list of people in the group, one per row, and each row has a person’s data as it exists in Grouper (e.g. name, HUID, NetID, email) Name:, is a person’s “preferred name”, and Email: is a person’s “official email” as identified in the IAM Identity Registry. Convert the member data into separate columns in the .csv file Select the column that has all the member data, which would be column A if the above instructions were followed. In Excel, select Data on the menu ribbon to display the Excel data features. In the Data Tools section select Text to Columns to bring up the Convert Text to Columns Wizard. In the option “Choose the file type that best describes your data:” keep Delimited selected, and then click Next. In the “Delimiters” section check the Space box. In the ""Data Preview"" window you should see a sampling of how the data will be separated into columns. Click the Finish button, and each row of member data should now be separated into multiple columns. Check the list of members to make sure all data is aligned in the right columns. If a person has a double first or last name separated by a space (e.g. Lisa Smith Gomez) then their data will be misaligned in the columns. Manually fix these so all member data is aligned. Important Security Considerations Delete any columns that are not required for your data needs such as EPPN or HUID. A person’s HUID is considered level 3 data and should only be kept in the .csv file if absolutely necessary. If the .csv file has both the name and HUID of people in the group you must send it securely over email.

IT Provider Services,Create composite groups in Grouper,"These instructions are for Delegated Group Administrators who are looking to create composite groups in the Grouper application. Composite groups either intersect the memberships of two groups to ensure members exist in both groups, or composite groups complement two groups to remove members in one group who do not exist in another. Uses: By intersecting the membership of a managed group with a reference or bundle group, the composite group will contain only members of the managed group that have a current Harvard affiliation. A composite complement group is used to exclude the University exclude users group, which by policy must be removed from any application authorization filter to prevent unwanted access to applications. Create a composite intersection group Navigate to or search for your folder in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. Create a group that will be the composite group. By convention, the managed group used in the first factor begins with “members-” and the composite group uses the same name without the prepended “members-” (e.g. members-my-group is the managed group, and my-group is the composite group). From the Group actions drop-down menu, select Edit composite. In the Composite option select Yes to open the composite selections. For the First factor group enter the name of the managed group that will be used in the intersection. By convention, this will be a group that starts with “members-” (e.g. members-my-group). In the Operation option select “and (intersection)” from the dropdown. Intersection means the resultant members of the composite group will be those who are in both the first and second factor groups, also referred to as an “and” function. For the Second factor group enter the name of another managed group, a reference group, or bundle group that will be used in the intersection. Intersecting with a reference or bundle group ensures the resultant composite group will contain only members of the managed group that have a current Harvard affiliation. Click the Save button to create the composite group and display it in the main window. Create a composite complement (minus) group Navigate to or search for your folder in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. Create a group that will be the composite group. From the Group actions drop-down menu, select Edit composite. In the Composite option select Yes to open the composite selections. For the First factor group enter the name of the managed group that will have members removed if they are not in the second factor group. In the Operation option select “not (complement) (minus)” from the dropdown. Complement or Minus means members are in the first factor group but not in the second factor group, also referred to as a “not” function. Complement is usually used for exclude lists, particularly in the construction of an application authorization filter to prevent unwanted access to applications. For the Second factor group enter the name of another managed group, a reference group, or bundle group that will be used in complement. Click the Save button to create the composite group and display it in the main window. View factors and membership of a composite group The First and Second factor groups, and the Operation of the composite group, are shown as a Note on the Members tab. Click on either the First or Second factor group to be taken to that group in Grouper. Use your browser’s back arrow to return to the composite group. The members of the composite group are listed under Entity name, the same as non-composite groups. However, these members are a result of either intersecting two groups, or subtracting one group from another. Note that you cannot add members directly to a composite group. All members have an Indirect Membership to the composite group because they are the result of performing an operation on two other groups. Edit a composite group Navigate to or search for your composite group in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. From the Group actions drop-down menu, select Edit composite. Change the First or Second factor groups, or the Operation. Click the Save button to apply the edits and display it in the main window. To edit the composite group name, ID or description, simply edit the group as you would any other group in Grouper. Members of a composite group cannot be deleted because they have an Indirect Membership in the composite group. If they are removed from the First Factor group however, they will be automatically removed from the composite group. Remove the composite on a group Navigate to or search for your composite group in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. From the Group actions drop-down menu, select Edit composite. In the Composite option select No. Click the Save button to remove the composite. Members can now be added directly to the group.

Get started Install the software: The desktop version of Zoom will give you the best results and functionality when hosting a meeting. Coach your students to install it as well. Students who plan to join Zoom meetings from a mobile device should also download the Zoom mobile app. Learn more about Zoom: Get to know your host controls Read up on running a smooth meeting in Zoom Sign up for training (offered by Zoom) Test your audio and video Visit zoom.us/test to check your internet connection, audio, and video. Do you need a headset? Which camera angle is best? If multiple meeting attendees are in the same physical space, in order to avoid feedback only one person should join the meeting with audio. Find your light! Make sure there is a light source (including windows) in front of you, not behind. Schedule your class sessions You can schedule Zoom meetings in a few different ways. Zoom can be enabled in your Canvas course navigation, which will be the easiest place for your students to find your meetings. You can schedule a Zoom meeting in your Canvas course and choose recurring meetings when appropriate. This way the URL will remain the same throughout the course. Remember to give your meetings a meaningful name! If you schedule from within Canvas: Course meetings appear to students within the Canvas course site Course meeting also appear to class participants as events in the Canvas Calendar Cloud recordings of meetings can be made available through the Canvas course site You can separate course meetings from other meetings Notes: By default, the meeting host is the only one who can view and edit details about a meeting. If the host assigns scheduling privileges to another person, that person will then be able to edit and schedule meetings on the host’s behalf. Only use your personal meeting ID and personal Zoom URL for unscheduled meetings. These meetings won't be available in Canvas as mentioned above and cannot be co-hosted. If your course cannot use Zoom from within Canvas, you can schedule meetings in the Zoom web portal (harvard.zoom.us) or desktop app (and share the join link with your students) or add Zoom to an Outlook meeting. Already have meetings scheduled within your web portal that you need to add to Canvas? You can import Zoom meetings into your Canvas course. Requiring your participants to register before joining the meeting will ensure that you will be able to download a list of participants once your meeting has concluded. Plan roles for students: don't host alone You’ll have a less stressful classroom management experience if you deputize someone else to manage aspects of the online space. By default, your TAs and any other teaching staff will be automatically added as alternative hosts for your meetings, and you can also add co-hosts during your meeting. Consider asking a TA or student to monitor the chat and another to help their peers with technology issues. That way, you can focus on teaching, and you’ll give students some extra digital skills practice. Encourage a sense of community The sense of presence will be enhanced when everyone shows their face via their webcam. Consider requiring students to turn on video as a key part of participation, since it is easier to engage with the class if you can see them. Students are more likely to pay attention if they know they’re on camera. Also, coach students on how to toggle to the Gallery view (this is the “Brady Bunch” view where everyone is visible to each other at the same time). Tips to share with your students: Make eye contact with the camera (the camera is the class!) Mute mics when you’re not contributing Find your light! Make sure there is a light source in front of you, not behind Speak in a conversational tone - you won’t need to raise your voice Headsets or earbuds can be very useful to improve sound quality For more tips, read up on running a smooth meeting in Zoom Prepare for technical issues Host a low-stakes introductory online meeting, with the sole purpose of having everyone log in, troubleshoot technical issues, and get used to the Zoom interface. Arrive early enough to work out technical difficulties. Have a backup plan in case of unexpected issues or difficulties (i.e. phone conference, using Canvas to facilitate the class, group discussions, or independent learning activities.). Inform students of the backup plan ahead of time so they can remain on task if technical issues occur. If using slideware, review how to share your screen with your PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides presentation. If you are using Google Slides Speaker Notes, your notes will open in a new window that is not shared with the Zoom participants. However, meeting participants will be able to see your browser URL and your open tabs. Create an agenda Plan for a synchronous online course session just like you would plan for an in-person class. Share your agenda with students ahead of time so students have a clear idea of how the class will progress, what will be covered, and the activities they’ll engage in. Periodically cover online etiquette and expectations of the students, or consider providing a ""best practices"" document that outlines the expectations. Record your session In the case that someone has a technical issue, you may want to offer them future access to the class material. To address this, you can record the class session. Record to the Cloud, rather than on your computer: It's convenient to record to the cloud, as you can receive both a URL to the video and an interactive transcript. There is no storage quota on Zoom recordings, and recordings of meetings scheduled via Zoom in Canvas appear within a few hours. Start recording in the right layout: The recording layout is based on your view when you begin recording. Therefore, remember to share presentations before recording, and switch to the active speaker view rather than the gallery view (or don't use your webcam at all), otherwise the video of you will be superimposed over the top right corner in the recording. Notes: If you set your meetings to record automatically, make sure to uncheck the ""Enable join before host"" option in your meeting's settings. This will ensure no students join early and start the recording from their screen. Let students know you're going to record the session. Offer students the option to mute their audio and/or turn off their video during the recording. If meetings are recorded to the cloud and you are using the Canvas integration, you can find the recordings right in Canvas. These recordings may be subject to different retention policies than other class session recordings. Contact your local academic technology support for additional guidance on where to store the recordings and how to display them to your class. Engage students You can use the features of Zoom to guide different types of interactive activities. These activities offer variety to break up a long class session, and they offer different means of expression. Chat Using the chat tool can encourage engagement by allowing more students to interact with the live activity, rather than just listening. There are even advantages of Chat over the traditional classroom: Get large numbers of responses to a question immediately, and use these responses in real-time or archive them for later. See exactly where students are on a particular issue or debate, informing who to call on next. Think about how, when, and where you want to allow students to engage in chat. For example, are you comfortable with comments in Chat throughout the class, or only at particular moments? If you have a TA who can filter comments, you might allow students to use Chat continuously; if you don’t, you might encourage its use at discrete times. Notes: Chat allows posts to the whole class or to one other person. You can download the full chat history at the end of class if you want to keep a record. Chat can be overwhelming for some students. It is recommended you offer this type of interaction as an option, but do not require it for all students. Chat can also be overwhelming for you to monitor while you’re also trying to teach. Have a student or TA to monitor the chat so you can focus on teaching. Screen annotation Zoom has basic annotation tools (text box, free form draw/pen, shapes, and highlighter) that you can use to guide students or explain a concept. Access these tools by selecting the Annotate option when you're sharing your screen. Note: Screen annotations are not accessible for screen reader users. If you use this feature, be sure to use accessible presentation best practices: say what you're doing while you're doing it, e.g., ""I'm drawing a big red circle around the login button on this web page."" Polling Set up polls in advance and launch them during your class session. Non-verbal and verbal feedback Activate the non-verbal feedback feature for your meetings to allow students to communicate with the teaching staff without interrupting the meeting. Routinely check in with students to address any non-verbal feedback. This feature also allows you to manage verbal feedback, as you can instruct students to use the ""raise hand"" feature to indicate when they'd like to speak. Remember to keep the students muted until you call on them to avoid extraneous background noise. Breakout rooms You can use Zoom’s breakout rooms functionality to have students do group work. As the instructor, you can join breakout rooms, broadcast messages to the breakout rooms, and end the breakout sessions when it is time to regroup. Self-select option for breakout rooms: hosts can create breakout rooms with the option for participants to self-select which breakout room they would like to join. If enabled, participants can move freely between breakout rooms, without needing the host’s help. Deliver accessible online class sessions If you have someone designated to take notes (an accessibility best practice), you can enable closed captions and live transcription. Live transcription transcribes the meeting automatically and allows real-time viewing of the full transcript in the in-meeting side panel. You can even use closed captioning in breakout rooms. If you require live captioning beyond what's provided through the live transcription feature, Zoom easily integrates with providers such as 3Play Media. Note: the cost of this service is not covered centrally. All students may not see or make sense of the visual display as you intend. Get in the habit of describing whatever is happening visually on the screen. Dive into specific teaching scenarios Host office hours or small group discussions Code review: You can use screen sharing to meet with an individual or group of students to review code. Authorizing remote screen control enables one to take control of the other's shared application and allows for navigation, text entry, etc on the remote computer. Note that when remote screen control is enabled, your Breakout Room setting will be disabled. Collaborative problem solving and brainstorming: Use the shared whiteboard feature to digitally annotate a whiteboard. Allow others in the session to annotate on the same board to share ideas and problem solving methods. A tablet is useful for handwriting. Consultation: You can use Zoom's high-quality audio and video to simply have a discussion with an individual or group of students. Easily share documents or anything else on your computer via screen sharing. Control who joins your session: The waiting room allows you to provide a single Zoom session ID and the ability to invite only selected individuals into the discussion. You can also set a custom message in your waiting room that lets students know you will be with them shortly. Pre-record video You can present slides to further explain a topic that was only touched upon in class or if several students ask the same question. Sessions can be recorded and shared for later viewing. Write on the board If you usually do ""boardwork"" as part of a class session, you have a number of options. Try the Annotation Tools (text box, free form draw/pen, shapes, and highlighter) to guide students or explain a concept. Screen share a camera input so that two cameras can be used at once during a Zoom meeting, with one focused on your writing. You can also join your Zoom meeting on your phone to be able to use its camera as a second camera. Use the Whiteboard feature, which works best when used with a tablet and a stylus. Create a PowerPoint slide or other simple backdrop file on which you can type notes, and share those notes using Screen Sharing. Create a ""shared board""--perhaps managed jointly with teaching fellows--using Google Drive. Prerecord the illustration as a video, then play it during class. As you think about these options, keep in mind whether you need the boards to persist and be distributed to the students after class. Host an interactive review session Host online review sessions leading up to a midterm or exam or an entire lecture. Use Zoom's polling feature to gather feedback on problems or topics to cover and private breakout rooms for discussion. Record the session, and share it for on-demand viewing. We advise muting all remote students and asking a TA to monitor questions in chat."

Teaching & Learning,Adjust settings to look your best on Zoom,"While you shouldn’t stress about how you look on a video call – after all, what you say is more important than your appearance – a little bit of prep work can make a big difference. With Zoom and other technology, you can meet with anyone from anywhere. But just because you’re joining a meeting from home or another remote location doesn’t mean you can slack on professionalism – especially if you’ll be on camera. Use these tips to appear more polished and make a great impression the next time you meet on Zoom. Be aware of your surroundings Strive to provide a plain background so viewers can focus on you instead of personal photos, wall art, or other distractions. To further avoid visual clutter, tidy up the areas of the room that will be seen on camera. Make yourself ""screen ready"" Take a minute to put on a nice shirt and comb your hair. If using a headset (which helps participants hear you better!), make sure it isn’t tangling your hair up. You may discover that getting ready for your work from home day is energizing – and your coworkers will appreciate not having to see your bedhead. Light up your face Make sure the light is in front of you, not behind. If you’re using a lamp, place it behind the screen. Turn off overhead lights, which can cast unflattering shadows. Natural lighting works well, too, but be sure you’re facing the window. Another trick: turn up the brightness on your screen so it illuminates your face. Position the camera at eye-level Many people place their webcam too low, which creates an awkward angle. Set your device on a few books or a box so that you’re looking slightly up to the camera for a more flattering angle. Back away from the screen Experiment with moving your webcam a little closer to your face and a little further away to figure out what works best. Aim to make sure most of your upper body — not just your face — is visible in the camera area. Create a video conferencing space in your home Once you’ve figured out your background, lighting, and web camera placement, you may want to create a permanent space that you can always use for video calls. If you regularly participate in video calls from home, this will make your life much easier!

Teaching & Learning,Submitting large files for Canvas assignments,"There is a 500MB file size limit in Canvas. Since some files (especially media files) exceed this limit, here are a few options for supporting large file assignment submissions. Note: While we list platforms and their maximum file size below, your ability to share large files is also affected by other factors. These include the device you're using, the type and bandwidth of your internet connection, and whether your browser is up to date. We recommend allowing extra time to test uploading and sharing large files. For Instructors Set up an assignment where students can submit a link to a large file: Create a new assignment in your Canvas course. Set the Submission Type to Online and check the box for Website URL (See the Panopto section below for alternate Submission Types that may be used).

Teaching & Learning,Improve Audio Quality in Zoom,"These suggestions are for Harvard Zoom users who would like to improve their audio quality during Zoom meetings. Log into your Zoom account, and see Getting Started with Zoom for more information. Use earbuds or a headset Ensure your meeting participants can hear you by using earbuds or a headset; computer microphones may be too far away to pick up your voice clearly. Computer microphones also can pick up room noise and vibrations from your desk. Rustling papers in front of a laptop mic or tapping on your desk is enough to drown out other speakers in the meeting. If you are having trouble using your Bluetooth headphones with Zoom, see the support article Using Bluetooth headphones with Zoom. Work from a quiet location To the extent possible work from a quiet location where you will not be interrupted. Even when using a headset, loud background noises can interfere with your speaking voice. Avoid echoes We all occasionally repeat ourselves, but if every one of your words echoes in a meeting it will be hard to understand you. To prevent echoes, make sure you join your meeting via a single audio source, i.e. computer audio or a phone line but not both. Similarly, when a group attends a meeting make sure only one member is providing the audio for the meeting. Don’t call from the road Joining a meeting while on the road is not a good idea, not only for safety reasons! Road noise or transit announcements are enough to make you hard to understand. Don't overload your device Close any unneeded applications and browser tabs during your Zoom meeting. Change Advanced Audio settings for professional audio uses Certain situations, like musical performances, benefit from disabling the automatically-added audio filters like noise suppression and echo cancellation. See Configuring professional audio settings for improving audio quality. Make sure your device meets the system requirements for using Zoom Review the requirements for PC, Mac, and Linux or iOS, iPadOS, and Android. In particular, ensure you have sufficient internet or cellular bandwidth: Try switching from cellular to Wi-Fi or from Wi-Fi to a wired internet connection to increase the bandwidth available to you. Turn off video and/or screen sharing in your Zoom meeting to preserve bandwidth for audio. After you have made adjustments, you can check your internet connection, audio, and video at zoom.us/test."

Under the Teaching/Advising tab, navigate to the My Courses section and click the Class Roster button. Step 2: In the Term Reporting column, click Mid-Term Progress Report. The Term Reporting column will only appear once mid term reporting is open and only populates for applicable students. Step 3: Enter the Mid-Term Progress Report. Click SUBMIT when you are ready to submit your report. Note: When you click SUBMIT, your note becomes part of the official student record. It cannot be edited. A copy of your mid-term report will be emailed to you. Additionally, a copy may be sent to other members of the student's academic team. Your mid-term report will also become an advising note, which will display to the student's direct advisors via the advising journal. Step 4: View Mid-Term Progress Report. Click the Exclamation mark icon next to the Mid-Term Progress Report. A new window will popup to view note. Please contact your FAS Registrar's Office with questions about mid-term reporting including inquiries about which students will require mid-term reports and how the reports will be shared: registrar@fas.harvard.edu Step 5: Resident Dean Communicates With Student The appropriate Resident Dean will review the report and set up a meeting with the student to address these concerns and connect them with resources. The Resident Dean will reach out to faculty directly if they need any further information. As part of those meetings, Resident Deans advise that students connect directly with course staff to determine how best to move forward. These meetings also review College resources, such as the Academic Resource Center, peer tutoring, the Writing Center, and the Disability Access Office, in addition to others. The student's adviser is a source of support for them as well. If you remain concerned about a student and do not hear from them directly, you can find the Resident Dean's contact information in the student's advising network (or here)."
Teaching & Learning,Harvard University Security Guide for Qualtrics,"Qualtrics is a powerful tool available to the Harvard community that enables a user to efficiently collect and analyze data. Understanding safe and effective use of Qualtrics is crucial to achieving its users’ desired results. This article is an important guide for general security; please contact HUIT Security to receive detailed advice for specific needs. Planning The Survey A well thought-out security plan is important for the success of your project. When planning your Qualtrics survey, make sure to consider the following questions: What type of data is being collected? Who will have access to this data? Where will the data be collected and accessed? When will the project conclude? What Type of Data is Being Collected? Harvard classifies data in five categories based on the effects of its potential disclosure. The full data classification table and examples can be found at privsec.harvard.edu/classify-risk. When planning a survey, you should consider the data you are collecting. The best way to prevent data from being disclosed is not to collect it. Once collected, protection of the data becomes the your responsibility. Limit the data collected to information required for the research or study. Pay special attention to identifiers such as names and social security numbers. Using Qualtrics to collect high risk confidential level 4 data With proper controls set, Qualtrics surveys can be used to collect responses that contain high risk confidential level 4 administrative data. Please submit this form to receive a short consultation with a Harvard IT staff member, who will help to configure your survey to meet IT Security guidance. Note: De-Identified Data, or data that cannot be directly linked to an individual, is intrinsically less risky to maintain. For guidance relating to the effective use of de-identified data, contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Research at http://vpr.harvard.edu. Who will have access to the data? Qualtrics users are provided many options for collaboration. Individuals from inside and outside the Harvard community can be granted access to a survey, its responses, and its results. Collaborators can be granted very specific permissions, and it is not likely that a survey would require all collaborators to have full rights for the duration of a project. With that in mind, tailor the permissions by considering the following questions: Should this collaborator be able to change, add, or delete questions from the survey? Should they be able to remove any results? Is it necessary for the collaborator to see individual responses at all, or would the aggregate survey results be sufficient? When is input or insight needed from the collaborator? Consider filling out a Collaboration Matrix, similar to the sample provided below. NAME Area of Expertise Permissions Granted Permission Timeline Purpose Joe Smith Information Security View Questions View Survey Revoked at survey launch Provide support in creating a secure survey J.R.R Tolkien Elven Languages View Responses Granted for two weeks after survey closed Translation of Elven Responses to English J.P. Morgan Investing View Results Granted at launch until study completed Provide insight into economic implication of results Once you have chosen your collaborators, make sure they understand their responsibilities. Accounts should never be shared. If survey creators wish to bring in the opinions of others, the other users should be added as collaborators with their Harvard Qualtrics account, a Qualtrics account supported by their institution, or a free Qualtrics account. Accounts should use Harvard credentials for identification and authentication whenever possible. Accounts for non-Harvard users should require complex passwords. See security.harvard.edu for specific guidance on passwords. Now that the collaborators have been informed of their roles and responsibilities, they can be granted specific rights within Qualtrics. Collaborating Inside Your Organization Collaborating Outside Your Organization and with New Users Click ""Details"" to further customize the Edit and View Reports permissions. Where Will the Data be Collected and Assessed? Though Qualtrics provides security for your data when it is stored on their servers, they cannot protect it before it gets to them or after it has been delivered to a collaborator’s web browser. Securing those parts of the process is known as “endpoint” security. Consider creative alternatives in situations where weak endpoint security is suspected. For example, smartphones and tablets offer higher levels of endpoint security than most desktop or laptop computers. Improve endpoint security by following this guide. Bad Idea Good Idea Why? Clicking links from people you don’t know, or weird links from people you do know. Assume links in email are bogus. Use your browser’s address and search options to get you where you need to go (e.g. https://www.paypal.com or https://www.facebook.com) Links can point one way and take you another. This is one of the most common ways accounts are stolen. You don't need to follow the email link to check on your accounts. When in doubt, type it out in the web address bar. Ignoring Updates from Microsoft, Adobe, Java, or other sources. Set up an automatic patch schedule. Most common attacks are carried out using bugs that have patches available because attackers know many people don’t update. Accessing sensitive information in public places such as a coffee shop. Limit use of laptops in public settings. Use password protected screen locks. Stepping away for even a few moments provides enough time for a stranger to be ""you"" on the internet. A locked screen protects your reputation and data. Uninstalling or disabling antivirus software. Use up to date antivirus software on your system. Antivirus is your last line of defense against being hacked. Find one that works for you and keep it up to date. Submit a ticket for assistance. When Will This Project Conclude? Create a timeline for the Survey. Make sure to cover the following milestones. Survey Created Survey Open for Responses Survey Closed for Responses Data Analysis Project Closed Each of these milestones will represent a possible trigger for the Survey administrator, from adding a collaborator to locking results. Plan the schedule so that data isn’t present for longer than needed. When the project is completed, there are several options for handling the data. It can be deleted, downloaded, or maintained on the Qualtrics servers. No matter what path is taken, the survey should be deactivated and all collaborators no longer requiring access should be removed at the conclusion of your project. Maintain with Qualtrics Delete Download PRO Easily access results for reference or further study. Most secure way to prevent data loss. Save the data in a format that can be manipulated by third-party tools. CON Potential for a data breach. The data cannot be retrieved for further reference. Some projects require ongoing access to data or data retention. Burden of data protection is on the user. Depending on the data, there may be regulatory requirements. Collecting Data With your project planned and survey published, it is time to solicit responses. Qualtrics surveys can be distributed through several channels, described on this support page. Use the option that best targets your particular sought after respondents. Limiting the publicity of the survey is a good way to limit risk. For example, if you don’t need feedback from the general Internet, don’t tweet the distribution link. Tips at a Glance Remember these tips to building a secure survey in Qualtrics. Tips for a Secure Survey Ask Yourself… 1. Collect only the data you need. What data am I willing to be accountable for? 2. Only Access Qualtrics From Trusted Devices. Would I do online banking on this device? 3. Collaborate with People You Trust. Would I trust this person with my personal Information? 4. Give the appropriate rights to the appropriate collaborators. Do I want an opinion on everything from everyone? 5. Use Calendar Reminders to remember to add, edit, or remove collaborators. Will I remember any of this six months from now without help? 6. Share your Survey Link responsibly. Do I really need respondents from my second cousin’s Facebook page? 7. If you have a concern, bring it to HUIT Security. Isn’t that what they are there for in the first place? In conclusion With proper planning and execution, Qualtrics can be a secure and effective way to carry out information gathering and collaboration for most any project. Specific support and assistance is always available by contacting HUIT Security."

Teaching & Learning,Add videos to Canvas,"Question: How do I add videos to Canvas? Answer: There are five ways to add instructional videos to Canvas. Note that these recommendations are for instructional videos only. View this article for information about lecture videos. Record a video directly in Canvas Upload video files Link to YouTube videos Link to videos hosted elsewhere Add video files to course Files area -- not recommended Note it’s also possible to add captions to videos hosted in Canvas or to videos hosted outside of Canvas. (See instructions for Instructors or Students.) 1. Record a video directly in Canvas This approach is good for creating brief “talking head” videos to make announcements to the class or provide context for an assignment. Step-by-step instructions on how to record video directly into Canvas: For instructors For students 2. Upload video files This approach is good for uploading existing individual video files. When using this approach keep in mind: The maximum file size is 500mb. This cannot be changed. There is no limit to the number of files you can upload to a course as long as each file is smaller than 500mb. Video files uploaded uploaded into a course count against the course quota. Files uploaded directly to your user files or group files count against each specific quota. When video files are uploaded they are converted automatically to a format supported by your browser. It's the responsibility of the Canvas user to retain a copy of the original unconverted video file if desired. (More information about supported file types.) If a video file is uploaded to a course site, and the site is then copied, the link to the uploaded video will continue to work in the new site. Step-by-step instructions on how to upload video files in Canvas: For instructors For students 3. Link to YouTube videos This approach is good for linking to larger video files that exceed the 500mb size limit for uploading files directly to a Canvas course. Step-by-step instructions on how to link to a YouTube video. Note that Students and Instructors can also link to YouTube videos in discussion replies. 4. Link to videos hosted elsewhere This approach is good for linking to larger video files that exceed the 500mb per video size limit or for videos that are available from other hosting services besides YouTube. Use an iFrame to embed the video in the Rich Content Editor. Add video files to course Files -- not recommended While it is possible to upload video files directly to course files or to a Canvas user’s personal files, this approach is not recommended because the video files will use up storage quota. For example: If a teacher uploads a video file into the assignment description, or into the course Files section, that file counts against the course quota. If a student submits a video file assignment, or uploads a video file to their personal files, that counts against the student’s user quota."
Teaching & Learning,Search By My Requirements (SBR) in my.harvard (Students),"Search By My Requirements Search By My Requirements (SBR) allows you to search for course offerings that will satisfy unmet requirements on the Academic Advising Report (AAR). Please note that your course selection should not be based entirely on the AAR or SBR as these tools do not replace academic advising conversations between you and your advisor. Please view the quick 2-minute Search by My Requirements Video Tutorial. The video transcript is also available to reference. Step 1: Log into portal.my.harvard.edu Step 2: Click on the Course Search tab. Step 3: Click the Search By My Requirements button. Step 4: Click on the red requirement line with the Not Satisfied notation to generate course search results below that will satisfy that requirement. Please see additional information about this at the bottom of the page. In the example above, clicking on the Writing Requirement resulted in 150 courses being found that can meet that requirement. Scroll down the page to view and navigate the full list of course results. Filters will display in the left menu to drill into the course results further (i.e. term, session, school, subject, meeting pattern, course component, course level, divisional distribution, cross registration, and location). Select the appropriate term for which you are looking for courses before reviewing the results. Like in the standard Course Search feature in the my.harvard portal, the SBR will list all courses that are available via Course Search. This will include courses for the current term and the future term in an academic year. The academic year courses remain listed until the first week of June when the courses displayed will then switch over to the next academic year. Please Note: Courses that you have already completed will also show up in the SBR search results if it fulfills a requirement. Please reference the Academic Advising Report (AAR) to confirm which courses are fulfilling requirements. Foreign Language Requirements met through test scores, department placement exams and waived requirements do not display as “Satisfied” in the Search By My Requirements tool however they will show as “Satisfied” in the AAR. Additional Information: Like the Academic Advising Report (AAR), the SBR contains requirements that need to be met for degree completion (i.e. College Requirements, General Education Requirements, Divisional Distribution Requirements, etc.). The requirements that are displayed on the SBR page are taken directly from your Academic Advising Report (AAR). It is recommended that you view the Academic Advising Report (AAR) in tandem with the Search By My Requirements (SBR) by clicking on the red Advising Report button located at the top of the SBR page. Like the AAR, if a requirement is satisfied, there will be a green checkmark along with a Satisfied note by the requirement title in the SBR. In the following example, the Language Requirement and Quantitative Reasoning with Data Requirement are Satisfied. A requirement that is not satisfied will have a red (X) icon with a Not Satisfied notation. In the following example, the Writing Requirement is Not Satisfied. For additional information, such as the number of courses that are still needed to meet a requirement or to see which exceptions have been granted by the department, please review the AAR as the SBR tool does not provide this data. If you have any further questions, please contact your Registrar's Office."

Supported file types The following file types are supported: .txt, .text, .conf, .log, .md, .asc, .csv, .list, .ini, .diff, .py, .java, .c, .h, .cpp, .hpp, .pl, .pm, .pod, .js, .rb, .php, .php3, .phtml, .html, .pdf, .pdfa, .fdf, .xfdf, .pdft, .docx, .pptx, .ppt File Size The LLMs used in the sandbox can only digest a certain amount of content at a time depending on the LLM model selected. LLMs measure content in tokens, and the number of tokens in a file can vary a lot depending on the content of the file. In general, text-heavy files will reach the AI Sandbox token limit much faster. The current token limits by model are: OpenAI GPT-3o Mini (200k tokens, ~150k words) OpenAI GPT-4o (128k tokens, ~96k words) OpenAI GPT-o1 (200k tokens, ~150k words) Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku (200k tokens, ~150k words) Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet (128k tokens, ~96k words) Meta Llama 3.2 1b (128k tokens, ~96k words) Meta Llama 3.2 90b (128k tokens, ~96k words) Google Gemini Flash 2.0 (1m tokens, ~750k words) Google Gemini Pro 2.5 (2m tokens, ~1.5m words) Code Interpreter Beta GPT-4o (128k tokens, ~96k words) Image Generation DALL-E 3 (50 images per minute) Upload your file Click the upload icon to the left of the text input field to upload your file. Your file manager will appear prompting you to select a file to upload. Click ""Browse Files"", and select the file you wish to upload. It is possible to upload multiple files at a time. A message will generate displaying the uploaded file names. If necessary, you can hover over a file name to remove it by clicking the X. At this point, you can prompt the AI about your file(s). If needed, previously uploaded files can be located by expanding the sidebar on the right and selecting Attach Files. A list of files will display. You can add previously used files to your prompt by clicking on the file(s) you wish to use. 5. To remove files from the Sandbox, click on Manage Files to open a popup window. Check the box next to the file name and click the delete button. Under Manage Files, you can also filter previously used files by name, date, context, and size. Troubleshooting If you have a text-heavy file and encounter a time out error, this can sometimes be remedied by trying the Code Interpreter Beta model.

Teaching & Learning,Signing the Crimson Cart in my.harvard,"Signing the Crimson Cart in my.harvard Depending on your schools policies, advisors may be required to sign the Crimson Cart electronically. For some schools, the advising hold must be removed before a student is permitted to enroll in courses. Step 1. Sign in to my.harvard. Locate the Worklist icon in the upper right hand corner and click the icon. The Worklist icon will indicate how many outstanding to do items are on your list. Step 2. View the Crimson Cart. Click Sign to approve the Crimson Cart. A snapshot of the Crimson Cart is captured in the student's advising journal upon signature. Signing a student's Crimson Cart removes the student's advising hold. For some schools, the advising hold must be removed before a student is permitted to enroll in courses. Once a cart is signed, it will display in grey and list the name of the signer. Some students have multiple advisors. If a student obtains a signature from another advisor, that student will display on your list in grey, and you will see the name of the advisor who signed the student's cart. Likewise, you will see your name appear as the signer for every cart you sign. In the example above, Janet Harvard signed Jane Harvard's Crimson Cart. It is also possible to sign the cart from Crimson Cart section of the student's profile: FAQ: I accidentally signed a Crimson Cart. Please contact your Registrar's Office. FAS: College Advisors, please contact the student's Resident Dean of Freshman or Allston Burr Assistant Dean to discuss reversal. GSAS Advisors, please contact the Registrar's Office to discuss reversal."
Teaching & Learning,Migrate your workspace into the Harvard Slack Grid,"Workspace migrations are for users interested in bringing a standalone workspace on a Free, Pro, or Business+ plan into the Harvard Slack Grid. Workspaces that fit the criteria for Harvard Slack Grid access are approved for migration. It is not possible to export your workspace out of the Harvard Slack Grid once it has been migrated. Workspace administration Content retention and data User migration Billing and payment Coordinate a migration Privacy Workspace administration Owners of standalone workspaces that migrate into the Grid will become workspace admins. Workspace admins control settings and add/remove members. One key difference from ownership is that admins are not able to add apps to their workspace that have not already been vetted by HUIT for security, privacy, and accessibility. Learn more about pre-approved apps and the process of app approval. Harvard’s organizational settings and policies will override individual workspace settings. Depending on permissions, admins may be able to make some adjustments to their workspace settings. Once migrated, the workspace owner will appear as slack_owner or Slack Enterprise Owner. The Slack Enterprise Owner account is used by HUIT administrators to create workspaces and manage the Harvard Slack Grid. Content retention and data All messages and content are retained during the migration, and once you’re in the Grid, content is retained indefinitely. The name and url of the workspace will also migrate. HUIT admins can change the name/url post-migration. Free workspaces will retain 90 days of messages, content, and file history when migrating to the Grid. Paid workspaces will retain all messages, content and file history when migrating to the Grid. Workspace data Once a workspace is part of an Enterprise Grid, admins lose the ability to export public channels from their workspace. Slack does not support imports to Enterprise Grid organizations. As an alternative, you can import data to a workspace outside the Harvard Slack Grid. User migration All users: workspace owners/admins, full members and guests, are migrated. User roles may be changed during the migration process, but all content that they posted will continue to be attributed to them. All active Harvard affiliates must be members in the Grid, and all non-Harvard affiliates must be guests. Outside collaborators If you’ve added collaborators from an external organization, you may either add them as guests or use the Slack Connect feature to participate in the workspace: If outside collaborators do not already use Slack at their organization, they can be added as single or multi-channel guests. Multi-channel guests do incur a cost for your school. For collaborators from an organization that already uses Slack, the Slack Connect feature is recommended instead. Slack Connect users only have access to the Slack Connect channel. Using Connect means these collaborators won’t need to be added to your Grid workspace and therefore do not incur any additional cost for your school. Billing and payment Due to Slack's billing processes, it may take longer to schedule migrations for paid workspaces. Paid workspaces that are migrated into Grid are no longer billed directly. Users in the workspace are included in the active user count for the Grid. Participating schools contribute to the Grid payment based on their active users. Schools oversee how that payment is covered for their constituencies. Once the billing linking process to the Harvard Slack Grid starts, your workspace must migrate. The Academic Technology team will confirm when you are ready to move forward with migrating to the Grid. Coordinate a migration Before scheduling your migration, HUIT Academic Technology will ask you to help with a few administrative tasks: Submit the Slack workspace request form and mention in the Workspace Details that you are requesting a migration for an existing space. Once approved, invite the Slack administrator account to be the new workspace owner (you will be provided with instructions to do this). Academic Technology will install an app called MigrationBot. This Bot will determine which members need to update their email address to match their official email as listed in the Harvard directory. Emails can be changed all at once by any workspace admin. It will also identify any users without a Harvard affiliation that will need to become multi-channel guests in your space, or any active Harvard affiliates that will be upgraded to full members. Free spaces may be updated to a Paid Pro trial to facilitate members’ account changes. It will be your responsibility to communicate these changes to your users. You may feel free to make these changes on your own, or wait for Academic Technology to make them for you. Any outstanding changes will be made by Academic Technology shortly prior to the migration to ensure no one loses access to the space or their history. Academic Technology will discuss migration timing with you and will set a date for the migration. Please note, it may take longer to schedule migrations for paid workspaces. The migration process itself takes approximately 45-60 mins, so users should plan for 60 minutes of downtime for their space. Once the migration is complete, Academic Technology will let you know if everything has been migrated successfully. Users will need to sign in post-migration at https://harvard.enterprise.slack.com or the workspace url. Active Harvard affiliates will sign in using HarvardKey. Non-Harvard users will sign in using the ""I have a guest account"" option. Privacy Once in the Grid, your workspace will be protected by Harvard’s agreement with the vendor. Please ensure that you’re familiar with the Harvard Privacy Statement for Slack. Once you have joined Harvard Slack Grid, you will be searchable by anyone else within the Grid. Slack DMs (direct messages) appear across all workspaces and can be sent to anyone else who is a Harvard Grid member. This can be surprising for new users of the Grid, but it is expected behavior. The Harvard Slack Grid is approved for L3 data. The Harvard Slack Grid does not support Slack AI at this time and has opted out of contributing to Slack's global AI/ML model.

Teaching & Learning,Email your Canvas course members using the Course Emailer,"Send an Email Using the Course Emailer Email Your Entire Course Email a Specific Section of Your Course Configure the Course Emailer Verify Your Default Canvas Email Address Set the Course Emailer Permissions Get Help These instructions are for teaching staff in residential Canvas (https://canvas.harvard.edu/) at FAS, HDS, Harvard Extension School, GSE, HKS, HLS, the Library, Harvard Summer School, HSPH, and HILR that want to communicate via email with enrollees in their Canvas course. HUIT supersenders can also use the Course Emailer. These instructions do not apply to HBS, HMS, or HSDM programs in residential Canvas. Nor do they apply to the separate HBS, HMS, or ExEd Canvas instances. Send an Email Using the Course Emailer The Course Emailer allows teaching staff to send emails to their entire class or a section of their class using their default email client (e.g. Outlook). The Course Emailer also displays enrollees’ email addresses, a feature not available in the Canvas People page. The Course Emailer may be a good option for teaching staff who are more comfortable communicating via email, or who want to keep all of their correspondence within their own email client. It is an alternative to the native Canvas Conversations messaging system. When the Course Emailer is added to a Canvas site, only teaching staff will see it in the left-hand navigation. An email address, used as a mailing list, is created for the course; additional email addresses are created for any section that exists in the course. Membership in each list is automatically updated to reflect changes in course enrollment. Mailing lists use the following format: Entire course mailing list: canvas-xxxx@coursemail.harvard.edu where xxxx is the Canvas course ID from the course URL, e.g.: https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/xxxx/ Section mailing list: canvas-xxxx-12345@coursemail.harvard.edu where 12345 is the section ID Email Your Entire Course Note: Before using the Course Emailer for the first time, be sure to configure the Course Emailer to avoid unwanted errors. To email the entire course, click on the mailing list email address next to the ""Course Mailing List"" header; a window will open in your default email client (e.g. Outlook) with the mailing list address in the ""To"" field. You can also copy the mailing list address and paste it into an email. There is a 25 MB limit on the size of attachments sent using the Course Emailer. Emails sent with an attachment larger than 25 MB will not be delivered. Please upload large files to your Canvas course and include a link to them in your email message. You will receive a copy of any email you send to a mailing list. (This does not apply to HUIT supersenders.) Note that emails sent to mailing lists from concluded courses will receive an error. Email a Specific Section of Your Course If your course has any sections in it, an additional tab will appear labeled “Email Specific Sections.” A mailing list for each section allows teaching staff to email only members of that section. Sections can be created with the Manage Sections tool or with the Student Information System (SIS) (e.g. My.Harvard). The section mailing list can send to either: members of that section and to all staff in the course, even if all staff members are not included in the section being emailed. members of that section only. Teaching staff will not see the email unless they are included in the section the email is sent to. If your course is jointly-offered, cross-listed between schools, or consolidated to share one Canvas site, a new tab will appear labeled “Email Registrar Enrollments.” (See more details in “How do I use the Course Emailer in a jointly-offered or cross-listed course?”) Configure the Course Emailer Before using the Course Emailer for the first time, you should verify your default Canvas email address and set the Course Emailer permissions you need. Verify Your Default Canvas Email Address When using the Course Emailer, you must send or reply to messages from the default email address in your Canvas account. Otherwise your message will not be delivered and you will receive an error. You can change the default email address in your Canvas account if needed. Instructors and students can also add an email address to their Canvas account. Note that if you have two different email addresses and you are sending a message from your first address but have changed your From Address in the email client to be your second address, you must: Add both addresses to your Canvas account, and Set your From Address as your default in Canvas. Set the Course Emailer Permissions Each Course Emailer email address has a permission set on it. The permission determines who can send emails to that particular list. The default permission setting is “Course Access” and can be changed for each list by clicking the gear icon. Permissions options are: Staff Access: For staff to email members of the course; students and guests cannot send or reply to the mailing list. Course Access: For all members of the course to email each other; students and guests can send and reply to the mailing list. Section Access [only available for sections]: For members of the section and all staff to email each other; students and guests in the section can send and reply to this mailing list. Disabled: The mailing list is disabled. Set the permissions as follows: ""Staff Access"" if you want only teaching staff to be able to send to a mailing list. “Course Access” or ""Section Access"" if you want students to be able to send emails to a mailing list. Note that Students cannot see the Course Emailer in the Canvas navigation. However, if the mailing list address is shared with students (for example posted on a Canvas page or if the teaching staff have sent an email to the list) and the permissions for that list have been set to either “Course Access” or ""Section Access"" students will be able to send emails to that mailing list and reply to emails sent from that list. If someone tries to send an email to a mailing list that they do not have permission to send to, they will receive a bounce-back email stating that message wasn't delivered.

Teaching & Learning,Add people to a Canvas course site,"These instructions are for teaching staff and course administrators who want to add people to courses in Canvas. Before trying to do this in Canvas, always try to add people to courses through my.harvard, or your Registrar's office. The steps below are for adding users to courses in Canvas when those options aren't possible. The steps below use the Manage People tool in Canvas, located in the left navigation of your course under Manage Course. Not all Schools have this tool enabled. If you don't see it and think you should, contact your School's academic support staff. Before you add users to a course in Canvas using this process, be aware of the following: Courses with large enrollments (1,000+) will break the Manage People tool. If you have any courses that exceed that enrollment limit, we would strongly suggest breaking them up into cohorts. People added to a course through the Manage People tool will have access to the Canvas site and other tools that use the course groups, but they will not be added as members of a course in my.harvard and its associated tools. You will have to assign each person a role. Roles have been pre-approved by your School and will appear in a menu for your selection. If a person has already been added to the course by the Registrar's office or Admin Console, you cannot use this process to add them in a different role. If you need to add a person to a course with two roles please contact your School's academic support staff for assistance. Users without an appropriate Harvard appointment cannot be added with staff or instructor roles; they can only be added with the Guest role. Only Canvas administrators can add people to concluded courses. Contact your School's academic support staff if you need someone added to a concluded course. Any instructor documentation on adding/removing users from a Canvas course site are not relevant to Harvard users. If you need help, contact your School's academic support staff instead of Canvas's instructor support. Add people to a course site in Canvas Select Manage Course from the left navigation and click on the tool card for Manage People Click Add People to course Use the search bar to find a person using their official Harvard email address or their HUID. If you don't know either, you can search the Harvard Directory to find a person's official email address. The system will return one or more matching user account records. Select an account record for the person you want to add, and choose a role from the drop-down menu. Click Add to course. You should then see a message that the user has successfully been added in the role. If the person you have selected is already in the People list for the course, a message will display showing the person's name and their associated role in the course. If you need to add a user to a course with two course roles (e.g. Student and TA), please contact your school's academic support staff for assistance. Remove people from a course site in Canvas People added using Manage People will be displayed with a red trashcan icon indicating they can be removed from the course. To remove users who either don't appear on the list, or appear with a gray trash can, contact your School's Registrar. People removed from a course will be removed from the primary course section as well as any secondary section they may have been added to using Manage Sections. Select Manage Course from the left navigation and click on the tool card for Manage People. Under Name / ID Type, review the list of course people and find the one(s) you want to remove. Click the red trash can adjacent to the name. Need help? If you need help adding or removing users, please contact the academic support team at your School."

Teaching & Learning,Use breakout rooms in Zoom,"Breakout rooms allow you to seamlessly split your Zoom meeting into separate sessions for small group discussion, and then bring those sessions back together to resume the large group meeting. As the meeting host, you can group participants into these separate sessions automatically or manually, and can switch between sessions at any time. Quick facts: There can be up to 50 breakout rooms per meeting, with up to 200 participants per breakout room Breakout room participants have full audio, video and screen share capabilities Hosts can move between breakout rooms Hosts can allow participants to select and enter breakout rooms as they please Participants can request help from a host while in a breakout room Note: Participants must be using the Zoom application to join breakout rooms; it is not possible to join via a web browser or in-room video conferencing system. As a workaround, these participants can use the main meeting room as their breakout session space. Getting started: Enabling breakout rooms Using breakout rooms Participating in breakout rooms Managing breakout rooms Advanced options: Pre-assigning breakout rooms Self-selecting breakout rooms Breakout rooms and recording Tips Video: breakout rooms Things to know about pre-assigning breakout rooms As a meeting host, you can split your meeting participants into breakout rooms when scheduling the meeting. This can be useful if you already know how you want to split up your participants. Pre-assign participants in the web portal This method is recommended for meetings with less than 20 participants. Pre-assign participants by csv file upload If you have more than 20 students in your class, and/or you will be using breakout rooms several times through the semester and wish your students to be assigned to the same breakout group each time, we recommend you pre-assign breakout rooms with a csv upload. You should NOT use the students' email addresses that are listed in Canvas to populate the csv file. You MUST take students' official Harvard email addresses found in the my.Harvard roster (or from the Registrar's office for schools that don't use my.Harvard). Students can change their preferred email address in Canvas, so using a list of those email addresses would break the csv upload. Once you have created a csv with students' official email addresses from my.Harvard or the Registrar's office, you can pre-assign breakout rooms with a csv upload. Before your meeting, instruct students to sign in to Zoom via SSO (HarvardKey), with the domain name/URL “harvard.zoom.us”. This ensures that students will be recognized by Zoom when they sign in, and they will be automatically assigned to their breakout rooms. Note: If a student arrives late to class and breakout room sessions have already begun, Zoom will now automatically send them to their assigned breakout room. Self-selecting breakout rooms Hosts may give participants the ability to self-select which room they would like to join without needing intervention from the host. Both the meeting host and participants need to be on Client 5.3.0 or later to self-select breakout rooms. Click Breakout Rooms once you have started your meeting Select the number of rooms you would like to create and Let participants choose room: Click Create. Your rooms will be created, but will not start automatically. You can manage the rooms prior to starting them, then you may click Open All Rooms once you are ready: Now that the Breakout Rooms are in progress, all participants can hover over the number of people in each room to select the Join button, which will assign them to that room: Breakout rooms and recording If the meeting is being recorded to the cloud, the recording will only record the main room, regardless of what room the meeting host is in. If the meeting is being recorded to a computer, the recording will include whatever breakout room the person recording participates in. Multiple people can record locally if allowed by the host. The host can designate one person in each breakout room to record locally and then share that file with the host after the meeting. This way, the host can have a record of what transpired in each room. Tips Practice using breakout rooms before trying it for the first time as a meeting host. Plan ahead: How many breakout rooms do you want to have? How many participants do you want in each room? Do you prefer to manually assign participants to rooms, or have Zoom randomly assign the rooms? Video: breakout rooms Need help? If you need help with breakout rooms in Zoom, please contact your school's local academic support staff."

This will indicate class seat or waitlist availability: Waitlisting Example: Beginning class capacity and total enrollment = 40 Dropped students = 2 Current total enrollment = 38 Open seats = 2 Waitlist Position Waitlist Program Runs New Waitlist Position Student A 1 Time conflict – remains waitlisted 1 Student B 2 Already enrolled in max credits – remains waitlisted 2 Student C 3 Enrolled in class N/A Student D 4 Enrolled in class N/A Student E 5 Waitlisted 3 Student F 6 Waitlisted 4 How to determine if a course offers a waitlist In my.harvard you can either search for all courses that offer a waitlist, or you can check the course details of an individual course. 1. To do a general search for all courses that offer a waitlist: Enter an asterisk in the course search. Select the term. Select “Yes” to view courses that have waitlists. 2. To review the waitlist details for a specific course, select a course of interest: If Waitlist Class indicates “No” there is no waitlist for the course. If Waitlist Class indicates “Yes”, then there will either be a limit on the number of students that can be on the waitlist or no cap on the waitlist. When there is a cap on the number of students, it will display as a ratio (ex. 1/3 - the waitlist allows a maximum of 3 students and there is already 1 student on the waitlist). If there is no cap, it will just show the number of students currently on the waitlist. A course may not appear full due to reserve caps; however, if you do not meet the reserve cap criteria, you can join the waitlist if the course offers one. If you meet the reserve cap criteria but the course is already in waitlist status, you will be added to the waitlist first by default, and then you will be given a reserved seat if one is available. You will receive automatic notifications of these updates. If you meet the reserve cap criteria but have a registration related error, you will not be able to enroll in the course. How to enroll in a waitlist Waitlists for FAS courses are only available during the add/drop period. 1. Resolve any registration related holds/errors. If you have a hold, you will not be able to enroll in a course’s waitlist, however you will still be able to submit a petition to the instructor. 2. If you have already submitted an instructor petition during the November/April registration week, you can skip to step 8. 3. Add the course to your Crimson Cart, by selecting “Add to Crimson Cart”. 4. Waitlist checker will be selected by default. Click “Next”. 5. Select the course and then click “Enroll”. 6. Select “Finish Enrolling”. 7. Select “Submit Petition”. You may enter optional comments in the next section. 8. Once the petition is approved, you will see a green check mark under the permissions column. Select “Enroll/Validate/Delete”. 9. Select the course and then “Enroll”. 10. Select “Finish Enrolling”. 11. You will receive a confirmation message that you have been placed on the waitlist. 12. A new section Waitlisted Courses will appear that displays your waitlisted courses. If you select the red exclamation, you can view your waitlist position. Waitlist notifications/course enrollment 1. If the next seat on a waitlist opens and you are eligible to be enrolled, you will be automatically enrolled and will receive a confirmation email. The course will now appear in the Enrolled Courses section in your my.harvard Student Home page. 2. You will not be enrolled and will remain on the waitlist if: You have a hold You have a time conflict (based on home school’s policy) You are already enrolled in the max number of credits You are repeating the course You will receive an email notifying you of the first enrollment error identified by the waitlist process. The error email notification is sent once per student, per class, therefore if you have multiple errors you will not receive subsequent notifications. It is your responsibility to address and resolve any errors that may prevent enrollment in the course when the waitlist process runs. Review the Holds in my.harvardknowledge article for an overview on how to view information about any holds you have may left to resolve. 3. Be sure to keep your waitlist status up to date. If you change your mind about a course, select “Drop from Waitlist” before you are automatically enrolled. Drop if Enrolled Option Students are encouraged to use the “Drop if Enrolled” feature to avoid being skipped by the waitlist process when a seat becomes available if a currently enrolled course will cause a time conflict or max unit/credit errors. 1. In your Waitlisted Courses section, you can select “Drop if Enrolled” option if you would like to be automatically dropped from a course of your choosing once you are enrolled from a waitlisted course. 2. Once you click on “Drop if Enrolled”, you will be prompted to select the course that you wish to drop should you be enrolled in a specific course from your waitlist cart. Waitlisting for Timed Sections If you choose to enroll in a waitlist for a closed timed section, you will receive an alert that “you will be waitlisted for all sections of the course,” which means you will also get waitlisted for the primary lecture/course. A seat must be available in the primary lecture/course and the timed section for you to get off the waitlist. That is why you may notice some courses will show as having a waitlist even if there is an open seat, indicating that a student may lose their seat due to being waitlisted for a timed section. There are three scenarios that can result in your timed section being waitlisted. Scenario 1: Enrolling in a primary/lecture course that is open, but the timed section is in waitlist status: The student is put on the waitlist for both the primary/lecture course and discussion/lab. If there is a time conflict between the open primary/lecture course and a currently enrolled class, then you will get a time conflict error and will not be able to enroll in the course’s waitlist. Scenario 2: Student is currently enrolled in an open primary/lecture course and discussion/lab but wants to change to a discussion/lab that is in a waitlist status: If you select “Edit” or “Swap” under your Enrolled Courses, you will be able to edit your timed sections. If you select a section that is in waitlist status, you will be waitlisted for both the primary/lecture course and discussion/lab. If there is a time conflict between the open primary/lecture course and a currently enrolled class, then you will get a time conflict error and will not be able to enroll in the course’s waitlist. Scenario 3: The primary/lecture course is in a waitlist status: You will be waitlisted for the primary/lecture course and the timed section (regardless of if the timed section is open or not). If both the primary/lecture course and timed section are in waitlist status, or if the primary/lecture course is in waitlist status and the timed section is open, you will be able to enroll onto the course’s waitlist even if you have a time conflict with a currently enrolled course. However, you will not be able to get off of the waitlist unless you resolve the time conflict. When waitlisting for the primary/lecture course, it is recommended that students register for the open TBA placeholder section for the class to have the best chance to be enrolled off the waitlist for the primary/lecture course."

Teaching & Learning,Add and manage alternative hosts for Zoom meetings in Canvas,"Overview Roles that can be alternate hosts Editing alternative hosts Changes to course teaching staff Extra help Overview This article explains how Zoom meeting schedulers can use the Zoom LTI in Canvas courses to add and manage alternate hosts when scheduling meetings. Teaching staff who have visited the Zoom page in their Canvas site are automatically added to Zoom meetings as alternate hosts when the meetings are created in the LTI. The person scheduling the meeting may not see all of the teaching staff appear as alt-hosts right away, but rest assured that teaching staff will be granted access to host course meetings once they access the Zoom tool in their course. Note: For cross-listed courses, if the primary course has the automatic alternative host function enabled it will be used for the course. Roles that can be alternate hosts Any Canvas course role based on the Teacher, TA, or Designer roles can serve as an alternative host. In the University residential Canvas instance this includes the roles of Faculty, Teaching Staff, Course Support Staff, Course Librarian, Instructor, Primary Instructor, Secondary Instructor, TF/TA, Faculty Assistant, and Preceptor. Note that in courses with multiple teaching staff, the first teaching staff member to start the Zoom meeting will become the meeting host. All other teaching staff who join the meeting later will be co-hosts. If necessary, the host can pass the host controls to a co-host or another meeting attendee. Editing alternative hosts Add a user with a teaching staff role to a course and have them click on the Zoom LTI page in the Canvas course. Add someone to the ""alternative hosts"" field when editing the meeting details in the Zoom LTI page in the Canvas site. Once a meeting begins, the host can enable a co-host for the meeting or pass the host controls to another meeting attendee. Changes to course teaching staff Any teaching staff added to the course after a Zoom meeting was originally scheduled will be added as an alternative host when they click on the Zoom LTI page in the Canvas course. The first time new teaching staff join a Zoom meeting they will see a Join button to enter the meeting and be added as an alternative host. For all future meetings they will see a Start button they can use to start the meeting as a host. Need help? Contact your local academic support staff if you need additional help managing the hosts for your Zoom meeting."
Teaching & Learning,How do I set permissions on files to restrict them to students?,"Question: How do I set permissions on files to restrict them to students? Answer: You can edit permissions for files, which includes setting the state of the file (published or unpublished), making files available to students who have the link, or scheduling availability dates for files. When you set a link restriction on a file, the file can only be viewed if students are given the link to the file. However, this option only allows files to be hidden from students in Course Files. This functionality is not valid outside of the Files feature. For instance, if a file with a link restriction is added to a Module or Assignment, the file can always be viewed by students. When the student availability date restriction is set, students can view the name and information for the file. In addition to Course Files, files with an availability date restriction can be viewed anywhere in Canvas (such as when the file is added to Modules or Assignments), but the file will be locked and students cannot view the actual file until the specified date. Note that when you link files to a public course syllabus, files restricted by link or date become available (using a verifier code added to the URL) not only to people enrolled in the course, but also to other logged in Canvas users and to people not logged in Canvas at all. In essence, the files become publicly available permanently, even if you restrict them later on. Similarly, if you make your entire course publicly visible, files restricted by link or date become available not only to people enrolled in the course, but also to other logged in Canvas users and people not logged in to Canvas at all. If you want to maintain tighter control over files in your course, do not make your course publicly available. It is recommended that you change course visibility settings to ""Institution”--this means all users associated with Harvard can view the course. For even tighter control, change the visibility setting to ""Course,” and deselect the option to make the syllabus public. Doing this limits your course access to enrollees. (For step-by-step instructions for course visibility options visit https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10436 .) Note: If your course visibility is set to ""Institution"" it is not possible to create a file link that will only work for enrolled students. For links to files in course syllabi and course pages, Canvas cannot differentiate if the link is being clicked by an enrollee in the course or by another logged in member of the Harvard community. For step-by-step instructions on how to restrict files, visit: https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10035 Get Help If you have additional questions, please contact your school's local academic support staff."

Teaching & Learning,Best practices for using Slack in a course,"These best practices are for teaching staff who are interested in using Slack with their courses. Organize your workspace Establish etiquette and community guidelines Embrace informality Try out a successful use case Get help Organize your course workspace Students, instructors, and teaching assistants can organize themselves into groups quickly. Channels can mirror real-world functions like lecture halls and classrooms, offices, and even areas for socializing. In terms of coursework, some of the most common and successful examples of channels are set up for: Online office hours: An #office-hours channel, where students can drop in with questions just as they would during in-person office hours, is a great resource teaching staff can offer students. Be sure to set and follow expectations around availability -- note that questions posted outside of office hours will be addressed at a later time, or a similar policy. Small group discussions: A private channel between an instructor and a small group of students may be just the thing to help you create a safe space to ask questions and share thoughts, ideas, and assignments. You can also use DMs (direct messages) to privately communicate with up to 8 workspace members. Project-based learning and lectures: Gather students, instructors, and TAs into project- or lecture-based channels, and you’ll be opening up a space for discussion. Thanks to features like search and pinning messages to channels, students can learn from the questions their peers have posted before them, saving educators time while ensuring that students are getting the information they need. Create successful channels Structure channels in a simple way. If students can't tell what a channel is for by reading the name, it's too complicated. Consistently name and provide topics for your channels, for example: #course-info: course information #q-and-a: general Q&A #assignment-1: discussion of assignment 1 section-1: private channel for section 1 section-2: private channel for section 2 teaching-staff-only: private channel just for teaching staff Broadcast announcements in a read-only channel Ensure critical info reaches the intended audience Limit posting permission to those who need it Allow students to reply (in-thread only) or just to ""react"" with emojis Create an #office-hours channel. You can start a Zoom video call by typing /zoom slash command in the message field of a channel or direct message. Establish etiquette and community guidelines Prompt students to: Be good citizens of Slack: answer questions, assume best intent, try not to sidetrack conversations. Understand public and private channels, and try to communicate with the proper audience. Use threads to organize smaller group discussions around specific topics. Format messages so that they’re easier to read. Use emoji reactions liberally to acknowledge messages while keeping channels from becoming inundated with reaction messages. Use the search function to try to find an answer, reducing duplicate questions. Manage notifications to reduce information overload and maintain focus. Remember that there are situations when it's best to move the conversation off of Slack messaging. Students can meet face-to-face using Zoom or Slack huddles. Embrace informality! Students want to communicate with professors, but traditional office hours often don’t meet their needs. They have questions, but the formality of email creates a barrier, deterring students from reaching out. Introduce Slack early and have students use it often to build familiarity. Encourage students to create their own channels, which may lead to more engagement. Try out a successful use case Here are a few setups for Slack that have been successful at Harvard and beyond: Create a virtual classroom community, with students supporting each others' learning. Alert classes about assignments and schedules. Interact in real-time or asynchronously, including everyone in the discussion regardless of different time zones. Create a live channel during a synchronous class for group note-taking and discussions. Give students a space to touch base after a course meeting. Support teaching staff by creating a space to discuss course structure and technical details. Reduce email use by communicating in open channels and building a shared searchable archive. Support students Steps: Create a channel specifically for students’ questions (e.g. #q-and-a), and one for #office-hours Add the Zoom for Slack app to start virtual meetings right from Slack Emojis may be used to “second” a question or show support Benefits: Students and teaching staff will know exactly where to go to receive and give support, respectively Students may help out their classmates if they know the answer to a question, too Communicate casually Steps: Give your community some guidelines and resources for getting started Let your community build out the workspace organically Benefits: Students will feel more comfortable building relationships with fellow classmates and teaching staff members in a low-stakes environment Students in different time zones may have an easier time catching up on conversations that happened earlier Support teaching staff Steps: Create one or more channels to use as back channels to communicate with course staff only Benefits: Teaching members will have the space to collaborate effectively Students will experience a more streamlined classroom environment Create a live channel during class Steps: Create a channel for in-class discussions Create a channel for synchronous note-taking If participation points are used in the course, offer points for organizing or moderating sets of group notes Benefits: Students have the opportunity to ask questions as they are fresh in their minds A notes channel pushes students to rely on their learning community for support, rather than depending on the instructor Debrief after a course meeting Steps: Create a channel for post-class-session discussions Benefits: Students will be able to clarify any questions about course content or next steps with assignments Students will be able to engage with the material further Announce assignments and scheduling Steps: Set the expectation for where students will find course announcements—will it be in Canvas, Slack, or elsewhere? Make sure everyone is aware of what they need to keep an eye on Guide your students to configure their notifications in Slack Set norms: if you are using an #announcements channel, you may want to guide your workspace community to create a channel-specific notification so students may be notified when anything is posted in that channel Note that email notifications may be set up to notify you of mentions and direct messages when you are not active in Slack Benefits: Students will not have to figure out setting up notifications on their own Students will know that they are receiving all important pieces of communication Teaching staff will be assured that students are receiving notifications Use Slack as part of a set of streamlined course tools Steps: Ask yourself and other course staff members a few questions to determine whether Slack may be a good tool to try out: Is there already a discussion tool in place for this course that fits our needs? Are there a number of other course tools that students need to learn? Would Slack add another learning curve for students to overcome? Are the students already familiar with Slack or other tools from other parts of their lives? If you decide to implement Slack, consider: Providing some light training for students to learn this platform Create a required assignment prompting students to log in to the workspace and orient themselves Set aside a few minutes during class time to show students the workspace and how it will be used Surveying your students throughout the course to see whether Slack has been a useful tool for them Benefits: Students will only need to learn the course tools that will be beneficial to their learning Students will feel that their opinions are being heard Get help If you need help using Harvard Slack in your courses, please submit a ticket or call 617-495-7777."

Teaching & Learning,Principles for use of online third-party resources in instruction of Harvard-enrolled students,"This document suggests principles to guide Harvard faculty, course instructors, and their support staff in their use of third-party websites, online tools, and digital platforms (“Resources”) in aid of instruction. Evaluation Considerations Green Light Resources Yellow Light Resources Red Light Resources Additional Policies and Guidelines Contact Information Evaluation Considerations When evaluating a Resource for use in connection with a course, instructors need to consider the following factors, in addition to the Resource’s value as an instrument of pedagogy: Does use of the Resource, either by the instructor or by students, necessarily result in the Resource gaining access to personally identifiable information (“PII”)[1] about students? If the answer to this question is yes: Does the Resource apply administrative and technical measures adequate to the task of securing Harvard students’ PII? Has the Resource adopted policy and practices sufficient to protect Harvard students’ privacy, in accordance with applicable law and Harvard values? Does the Resource conform to the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, level 2.1 AA? The framework set forth below presents principles instructors should follow when they make Resources available for use by their students. If a Resource has a green light treatment, it is appropriate to present the Resource to students as a required resource. If a Resource has a yellow light status, the Resource should be presented only as an optional resource. If a Resource is assigned a red light designation, instructors should not recommend the Resource for use even at the student’s option. For assistance in evaluating Resources for use in courses, instructors can also contact ithelp@harvard.edu or their school's local academic technology support. Green Light Resources Applies when: The Resource meets both the Privacy Standard and the Accessibility Standard. Privacy Standard A Resource may meet the Privacy Standard in one of five ways: The Resource does not require user registration or credentialed login. The Resource is entirely passive/informational or does not store PII about users and will not be used to store PII about students. The Resource has been acquired subject to Harvard’s Personal Data Rider. Sufficiency of Privacy Policy/HUIT Security Review. — The Resource has posted a Privacy Policy by which it commits at least to reasonable administrative and technical measures to secure PII and provides privacy assurances at least as stringent as the following: The Resource will not sell access to student[2] PII. The Resource will not use student PII provided for purposes of accessing the Resource, except as needed to provide the Resource to the student or instructor. The Resource will not disclose within or outside the Resource organization any student PII provided for purposes of accessing the Resource, except as needed to provide the Resource to the student or instructor, And in the case of disclosure to outside contractors, the outside contractors agree not to disclose the PII to third parties and to use the PII only as needed to provide the Resource. The Resource allows students and instructors to delete or remove PII. PII Avoidance Strategy. — In a case where a Resource only requires users to register and does not otherwise collect PII, an instructor may advise/ encourage students to create accounts using pseudonymous information. Accessibility Standard A Resource meets the Accessibility Standard in one of two ways: The Resource has been acquired subject to Harvard’s Accessibility Rider. Accessibility Review + Accommodations The Resource has been reviewed by School or central accessibility staff for adequate levels of conformance to applicable accessibility guidelines and to the extent an exception is required, accessibility staff is satisfied that accommodations may be made to students to provide appropriate access. If instructors are unsure whether a Resource fits either of these criteria, they should contact ithelp@harvard.edu or their local school level academic technology support. Treatment Instructors may freely introduce the Resource to students and require them to access and use it. Examples Examples of green-lighted Resources include YouTube and Google Books. Yellow Light Resources Applies when: Instructors or supporting personnel post PII about students to the site/tool/platform, or Students post their PII to the site/tool/platform, or Students must register as users in order to access and use the site/tool/platform. Treatment Instructors may make the Resource available to students only on an optional basis — i.e., use of the Resource is not required in the course, and a student’s decision not to use the Resource will not affect the student’s grade. In addition, instructors or their Schools may undertake the following steps to move a yellow-lighted resource to green: Harvard-Specific Contractual Commitments Instructors and their Schools should work with Procurement and/or HUIT to get a signed contract in place with the Resource provider. At a minimum, the contract should: Apply to all use of the Resource by Harvard instructors. Include the Personal Data Rider with the Rider’s optional FERPA language included. Include the Digital Accessibility Rider. Include appropriate language restricting the use of Harvard names. Override any terms of use that purport to apply to Harvard based on a Harvard instructor’s clickthrough agreement. Student clickthroughs will not affect the enforceability or applicability of the terms imposed by Harvard. Upon execution of a contract that meets these requirements, the Resource could be considered a green light status. Other Pathways to Green Absent a written contract with the Personal Data Rider included in it, a Resource may meet the Privacy Standard if it meets the conditions set forth above for “Sufficiency of Privacy Policy/ HUIT Security Review.” In such cases, OGC should review the applicable Privacy Policy to confirm that the above requirements are met. In addition, an instructor may meet the Privacy Standard by advising students consistently with the provisions set forth above in “PII Avoidance Strategy.” Absent a written contract with the Accessibility Rider included in it, a Resource may meet the Accessibility Standard if it meets the conditions set forth above for “Accessibility Review + Accommodations.” Instructors should be aware that some tools are not accessible to students who require accommodations. If a student with such needs is part of the class, then instructors must consult with their Local Disability Coordinators to identify alternate approaches and set in motion necessary support steps. Compelling Exceptions In the event that Harvard is unable to assign a green light designation by any of the means listed above, an instructor may petition HUIT and VPAL for green light designation (an “Exception Petition”). An instructor should submit an Exception Petition only after exploring all options to meet the Privacy and Accessibility Standards, including by negotiating an appropriate contract with the Resource provider and engaging OGC and HUIT for Privacy Policy and security reviews, respectively. The instructor must be able to state a compelling case in the petition for why the pedagogical benefits of using the Resource significantly outweigh any security or privacy concerns the Resource provider has declined to address. The absence of a green light designation makes a Resource presumptively unsuitable for required use by students. Accordingly, only the rare compelling case will warrant the grant of an exception. In no event may Harvard instructors use a Resource if its use would cause Harvard to violate applicable law. Red Light Resources Applies when: The Resource provider sells access to user PII or otherwise discloses (or allows or asserts a right to disclose) PII to third parties, except as needed to facilitate operation or improvement of the Resource. Treatment Instructors should not require or advise students to use the Resource, even on an optional basis. Additional Policies and Guidelines In their dealings with Resource providers and vendors, instructors should be mindful of the following Harvard policies and guidelines: Policy on Use of Harvard Names and Insignias Use of Harvard Names and Insignias in Electronic Contexts Guidelines for Responding to Requests from Third Parties for Endorsements Contact Information Please contact ithelp@harvard.edu with any questions or concerns about these principles for use of online third-party resources. [1] For these purposes, “personally identifiable information” means a student’s name; the name of the student’s parent or other family members; the address of the student or student’s family; a personal identifier (such as the student’s Social Security number, HUID number, or biometric record); other indirect identifiers (such as the student’s DOB, POB, and mother’s maiden name); other information that alone or in combination is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty; or information requested by a person that Harvard reasonably believes knows the identity of the student. [2] For these purposes, “students” includes graduate students who are assisting with instruction, e.g., as Teaching Fellows or pursuant to a similar appointment."

Teaching & Learning,Quizzes in Canvas,"Question: What are Quizzes in Canvas? Answer: Quizzes in Canvas are assignments that can be used to challenge student understanding and assess comprehension of course material. The quiz tool is used to create and administer online quizzes and surveys. Quizzes can also be used to conduct and moderate exams and assessments, both graded and ungraded. Canvas has four different types of quizzes: A graded quiz is the most common quiz and rewards students points based on their quiz responses. A practice quiz is a learning tool to see how well users understand course material without providing a grade. A graded survey rewards students with points for completing a survey but grading is not based on right or wrong answers. An ungraded survey obtains opinions or other information without providing a grade. You can use Quizzes to: Create new quizzes with individual questions and question groups Set up question banks Import external quizzes Show one quiz question at a time Create quizzes for all students, individual students, or course sections For step-by-step instructions on how to use Quizzes visit: https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/tkb-p/Instructor#Quizzes"

Teaching & Learning,Using Discussions in Canvas,"Canvas provides an integrated system for class discussions, allowing both instructors and students to start and contribute to as many discussion topics as desired. Discussions allows for interactive communication between two or more people; users can participate in a conversation with an entire class or group. Discussions can also be created as an assignment for grading purposes (and seamlessly integrated with the Canvas Gradebook), or simply serve as a forum for topical and current events. Discussions can also be created within student groups. Discussion topics can be a focused or threaded discussion. Focused Discussions are relatively short-lived interactions that tend to ""disappear"" as the course progresses, such as a weekly forum for questions related to that week's activities. Use a Focused Discussion for single posts and related comments. One discussion leader typically posts a message and multiple learners comment on it. Participants may leave a side comment to a reply, but cannot develop the conversation beyond two layers of nesting. Threaded Discussions allow replies within replies and may persist for a longer period of time throughout the course. They lend themselves to the refining of complex ideas. Responses and different lines of inquiry can be quickly navigated due to their hierarchical structure. One or more discussion leaders post a message and multiple learners comment on it with the freedom to create any number of related discussion topics and comments (infinite layers of nesting).

Teaching & Learning,Instructional contingency recommendations,"These recommendations are to help faculty plan for technology disruptions while teaching remotely. Be Prepared What if there is a Zoom outage? During the class In the event of a long-term outage What if my class gets Zoom Bombed? What if there is a Canvas outage? During the class In the event of a long-term outage Be Prepared Teaching remotely means being prepared in different ways than in-person teaching. Have a clear plan for both global outages and interruptions to your individual Internet connection that you share in advance with your students, and tell them where you will communicate in the event of an issue. Download your class roster from my.harvard or ask for it from your registrar. Determine how you will contact your students if the technology you normally use is not available. For example, you can use the my.Harvard Faculty Center to email your students. Other methods might include Canvas announcements, the course emailer, Slack, etc. Choose a backup strategy: Applying a low-tech alternative to the class meeting (see the minimal bandwidth options below). Scheduling a make-up class session. Using an alternative/backup technology such such as Microsoft Teams or Slack. Ensure you have class materials available to you outside of Canvas. Be ready to send readings, assignments, or slides by your selected technology. If you use the Gradebook, save a copy as a spreadsheet to another location. Communicate your backup strategy to your students so that everyone knows what will happen in case of a global or individual outage. Minimal-Bandwidth Class Alternatives There are several modifications you might make to your course if network bandwidth becomes an issue. Here are some ideas based on the type of course: Lecture-oriented: If the instructor will almost exclusively be talking over slides, etc., turn off student video streams. This can be done ahead of time, or during a class session itself. Students do not need to have their own video turned on in order to use the raise hand feature, or to ask questions in the chat dialog. Case-based (and small- to medium-sized lecture courses emphasizing student participation): If the engagement afforded by seeing student video streams is needed, instructors can break the class sessions into chunks with different groups of students turning on their video feeds at different times. For example, students with last names A-M are turned on for the first half of class, and N-Z for the last half of class. This ensures equity in this more interactive class format. Second, classes can make use of the chat platform in Zoom, which requires relatively little internet bandwidth. Small group discussions, seminars, etc: In this setting, the same strategies outlined above can be used. It may be straightforward to ask students to individually turn on their camera when speaking, and then turn it off once done. It is important to remember that when a student turns on their video it puts additional pressure on their own connection to Zoom. Be understanding if some students need to turn off their video because of bandwidth limitations. What if there is a Zoom outage? During the class If you encounter an unexpected interruption to your Zoom session: Wait 90 seconds -- Zoom will try to reestablish your connection. Leave and rejoin the meeting. Verify with HUIT that Zoom is experiencing issues. If you have local network issues, you may need to connect with an available mobile device. Use Canvas announcements to share next steps (for example, that students should rejoin the meeting). In the event of a long-term outage Go low(er) tech. Assign readings and have students submit response papers or other alternative assignments via Canvas, Google, or email, in lieu of a lecture or seminar discussion. Use Assignments and Quizzes in Canvas to assess student understanding. Use discussion tools for one-on-one or group communications using Canvas, Microsoft Teams, or Slack. Use text messaging for group chat or quick questions. Schedule a make-up class session. Record your classes for student download Pre-record your first lecture and have it on stand-by in case you need it. Use Zoom or Panopto to share the recording in Canvas. Use the narration feature in Powerpoint or Keynote to record over a slide deck to also share in Canvas. Consider recording remaining lectures in advance and have them ready to go. Use an alternative technology Use supported video conferencing tools in Microsoft Teams or Slack, as recommended and supported by your school IT staff. Note the following considerations: Microsoft Teams allows all users except DCE students to create meetings, can support up to 300 participants, and does not have break-out rooms or a dial-in option. Slack is available to the College and GSAS, and is in pilot at other schools. It can support video for small groups of up to 50 participants. Review more information about specific tools and resources. What if my class gets Zoom Bombed? Zoom bombing is when meetings are purposefully (and often offensively) disrupted. We have enabled default security settings in Harvard Zoom accounts to help secure your Zoom meetings, but if Zoom bombing does occur you should end the Zoom meeting immediately and move to your contingency plan. Talk to your students in advance about resuming your class meeting in the event of a disruption. Let them know: Where they should look for information from you (Canvas announcement, email, etc.) How you'll plan to resume (another Zoom meeting, online discussion in Canvas or elsewhere) That it may take a bit of time to regroup and that you thank them for their patience. After class, report the incident. Make a note of the meeting ID and send an email to ithelp@harvard.edu. What if there is a Canvas outage? During the class Verify with HUIT that Canvas is experiencing issues. Use your alternative method of communication to let your students know about next steps. HUIT and your school academic technology groups will keep you and the entire community informed. In the event of a long-term outage Communicate the plan to transition to alternative means of sharing content and interacting. Communicate your expectations of your students -- will you extend deadlines, utilize email for submissions, etc. Place the materials you previously downloaded in your alternative platform."

Drag, and drop a workspace name to reorder on the list. To remove a workspace, hover over a workspace name and click Remove. Click Save & Reload when done. There are a number of Home preferences you can set to tailor how Slack is organized. Learn more about adjusting your Sidebar Preferences. Tips for Organizing Channels Star channels and direct messages. All your most important conversations will appear in the Starred section of your sidebar. Create custom sections for channels. Using custom sections can help organize your channels, direct messages (DMs), and apps within your sidebar. Mute the channel, if there’s too much chatter. Muted conversations will appear grayed out in your channel list. You will only receive a notification if mentioned. View unread messages. In the All workspaces channel view, it’s helpful to have unread channels appear at the top of your sidebar. Switching between Harvard Grid and External Workspaces If you’re signed in to an external workspace (workspaces outside the Harvard Grid), use the workspace switcher to move between spaces. Use ⌘+Shift+S (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+S (Windows) to access the workspace switcher. If you would like to always see your external workspaces, select Show workspace switcher. For more tips and tricks with shortcuts, visit Slack keyboard shortcuts webpage. Slack Navigation Bar Your Slack sidebar is the access point for different parts of your workspace. Users can rearrange tabs to prioritize the tools they use frequently in the Harvard Grid. Learn more about adjusting your sidebar preferences in Slack. Direct Messages Slack added a new Direct Messages (DM) notification view with its own icon. You can still access your DMs in the bottom of your sidebar where channels live. Users can DM anyone in the Harvard Grid: Confirm you have the right user. Users across the Grid do not automatically have access to your workspace. Activity Area The Activity icon in the Slack sidebar is where you can quickly review all of your notifications. When you open Activity, you’ll land in the All tab — a chronological feed of your notifications. Click each tab to switch between the different types of notifications, like mentions, replies to threads or reactions to your messages. You will see a badge on the Activity icon every time you receive a notification. Reactions to your messages won't trigger a badge, but you will be able to view which messages have new reactions as they happen. As a reminder, you can configure your Slack notifications and manage your notifications for specific channels and DMs. Later The Later section is where your saved messages and files in Slack are stored to easily refer to them later, or you can set yourself a reminder to come back to something at a more convenient time. Profile Icon Your profile and preference menu is located at the bottom left in the new Slack UI. The Create New (+) button above your profile allows you to start DMs, channels, huddles, and canvases, as well as inviting new members to your workspaces. You can still compose DMs using the New Message icon at the top of your sidebar. Templates Slack templates bundle canvases, lists, and workflows together in a channel. Choose a template and fill in key details instead of creating a channel to manage a process from scratch. Themes Slack created a variety of pre-made themes in addition to color swatch selectors for the app. You can choose only one theme for Harvard Grid workspaces. You can customize different themes for workspaces external to the Harvard Grid. Learn more about changing your theme or importing a custom theme.

Teaching & Learning,Is Piazza available in Canvas?,"Question: Is Piazza available in Canvas? Answer: An institutional agreement has not been reached with Piazza because they have not addressed Harvard's business concerns. The way in which Piazza wants to use the Harvard channel to market its ""Careers"" services to students is the primary concern; such marketing to students through a Harvard-provided facility conflicts with Harvard policy. Therefore the app has not been added to the list of External Apps available in Canvas. Faculty and students individually subscribing to Piazza should be aware that this marketing to students will occur, on an opt-in basis for the students. Students should be sure they understand what they will be signing up for and, in particular, should be cautious about what personal information they provide to Piazza for this purpose."

Teaching & Learning,Privacy guidance for LTI tool development,"Privacy guidance for LTI tool development Software that integrates with Canvas via LTI, or that uses OAuth tokens to interact with the Canvas API on behalf of users, can have access to information that is governed by FERPA and by University privacy and data security policies. It’s important that all software and systems that handle and store this data operate in a manner consistent with University policy. Software developers and technical staff can find more details on the Harvard University Information Security website. Generally speaking, this means ensuring that sensitive data is transmitted and stored securely, and that proper controls are in place to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the information. You can find helpful guides on how to assess your own information security practices on the Information Security website. All HUIT groups complete this security assessment every year, and it’s a good practice for people who have access to sensitive data to review their local practices as well. If your application will use OAuth tokens to operate on behalf of (impersonate) users, it’s extremely important that these tokens are stored securely and used properly. One user’s token must never be used to read or write data in Canvas on behalf of a different user."

Teaching & Learning,Using the Course Info Tool in Canvas,"Question: What is the Course Info Tool in Canvas? Answer: The Course Info Tool pulls data about a course from the Registrar's Office via the student information system (e.g. my.Harvard) and embeds it within a rich content editor box in that course's Canvas site. The Course Info Tool may already appear on your Canvas site if your school has chosen to include it in the course template for your school. Who can use the tool? Anyone who has access to use a rich content editor will be able to embed the Course Info Tool. Where can I add the tool in my Canvas site? Teaching staff most commonly choose to include the Course Info tool in their Syllabus or Home page. It may be embedded in any page that has the rich content editor, for example: Syllabus, Pages, Announcements, Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions, etc. How do I add the tool to my Canvas site? Navigate to a rich content editor. Within the editor, select Tools>Apps>Course Info tool A box will pop up to allow you to select which information you'd like to include. Click on the checkboxes to select the categories of information you want to appear. Choices include the school and course code, term, instructors, location, meeting time, exam group, course description, and a notes section that allows you to enter text.

As Registrar information is added or updated, new information will be displayed. Click on the ""Save"" button. The editing pop-up box will close, and you will then see a large gray box, which indicates that the Course Info Tool was successfully embedded in the page. You can save the page as is or add text before or after the embedded Course Info tool. If some of the course information changes, does the tool update? Yes, the tool updates automatically. If the registrar alters any information related to the course, the information displayed in the tool is updated. Can I change which categories of information the tool displays? You can't change the categories of information the tool displays. Instead, you will need to delete the tool and add it again. Can I change the information displayed in the categories? The information displayed in the tool is fed from the Registrar's Office or student information system (e.g. my.Harvard) and is the same information displayed in the course catalog. If information is incorrect, please go through the normal channels as you would when updating course information for the catalog. Why aren't all the selected categories of course information being displayed? If a category of information you selected to include isn't appearing, it means there is no information being fed from the registrar for that category. If this is occurring, you will see a message underneath the course information box stating ""Additional Information will be shown if available from the Registrar."" Once the registrar begins feeding the information, it will appear in the tool. Please contact your Registrar if any information that’s displayed needs to be changed. Who do I contact for help using the tool? Contact your local school support with any questions."

Teaching & Learning,About my.harvard Ideas,"About Ideas my.harvard Ideas was established to gather feedback and suggestions for improvements from the Harvard community. Over the years, the my.harvard team has listened to concerns from students, instructors, advisors, and staff about the challenges they encounter when using my.harvard. We aim to address many of these issues with future updates. The first phase of these enhancements is the introduction of the new Course Search BETA. We encourage you to explore it if you haven't already! How Do I Submit an Idea? To begin, we ask you to review existing Ideas. You can do this by using the Search Ideas feature on the Ideas homepage to browse through current submissions. If you come across an Idea you support, you can show your approval by clicking on it in the search results and then selecting the upvote button. If you have a unique suggestion that isn’t already listed, start the submission process by clicking the Submit an Idea button on the Ideas homepage. When describing your Idea, please provide as much detail as possible to ensure we fully understand your suggestion. What Kind of Ideas Can I Submit? You can submit Ideas of any kind! We are particularly interested in suggestions for enhancing major components of my.harvard, such as Course Search, Student Search, Student Home, or Instructor/Advisor Home. We also welcome feedback on workflows like enrollment, cross-registration, and lifting holds. At the same time, we value suggestions for minor improvements, such as noting if an icon, error message, or other element is confusing, difficult to locate, or not quite right. What Happens After I Submit an Idea? Once you submit an Idea, it will initially have a Submitted status. Ideas in this status are not yet included in the search results nor are they available for upvoting. Shortly after your submission, we will review your Idea and update its status. Some of the potential statuses your Idea may receive include: In Review Ideas with this status are currently under review by the my.harvard team. If your Idea is deemed unique and aligns with our Community Standards, its status will be updated to ""Published."" Published Ideas with this status have been approved for inclusion in the search results and are available for upvoting. Other members of the Harvard community can view the details of your Idea and have the opportunity to upvote it. Selected Ideas that have reached this status have been chosen for future enhancement of my.harvard. Although your Idea is planned for implementation in an upcoming update, we may adjust some details during the development process. Complete Ideas in this status have already been implemented. Thank you for your valuable contribution! Declined Ideas in this status are generally not feasible from a technical or policy standpoint. Occasionally, an Idea might be viable but is outside the scope of my.harvard, such as suggestions for improving other Harvard systems or services like Canvas. Removed Although not technically a status, we reserve the right to remove your submission from Ideas if it contains inappropriate content or language, is unrelated to my.harvard, or otherwise fails to meet our Community Standards. How Can I Track the Status of the Ideas I Submit? Once you've submitted an Idea, you can track its progress on the My Ideas page. To access this page, click on your name in the toolbar and select My Ideas from the dropdown menu. Community Standards Ideas are constructive and specific. Rather than simply expressing complaints, submissions must include clear descriptions of how they aim to improve my.harvard. While you don't need to provide technical details such as code or configurations, it’s important to offer enough information for a basic understanding of your Idea's concept. Ideas that lack sufficient details may be removed. Ideas are respectful and do no harm. Ideas should not negatively target or criticize members of the Harvard community or its policies. Submissions containing inappropriate or offensive language, or those deemed harmful, will be removed."

Web Publishing & Hosting,Apply a custom domain to your HarvardSites website,"What is a Custom Domain? A custom domain is a URL for your site that differs from the default URL assigned at site creation. When you create a website on the HarvardSites platform, it receives a default URL, such as: sitename.scholars.harvard.edu (for academic profile sites on HarvardSites Drupal) sitename.hsites.harvard.edu (for all other site types on HarvardSites Drupal) sites.harvard.edu/sitename (for sites on HarvardSites WordPress) However, when your website goes live, you might want to use a custom domain such as: sitename.fas.harvard.edu Applying Your Custom Domain Please note: If this is a new domain, be sure to read Get a Harvard domain for your website before submitting your request. You must first obtain written approval to use a new 3rd or 4th level Harvard domain before it can be applied to your site. Before you start this process make sure your site is ready to launch.

Web Publishing & Hosting,Pantheon Managed Web Hosting for WordPress and Drupal,"What is Pantheon? Pantheon provides managed hosting optimized for custom Drupal and Wordpress sites. Harvard has partnered with Pantheon to offer web hosting packages to accommodate a wide range of site types and needs. Pantheon’s hosting services are available to internal Harvard teams building custom sites or those working with a third party developer/outside vendor. See also: Getting started with Pantheon Why host your site with Pantheon? Harvard Web Publishing’s platform offerings (OpenScholar and CampusPress) cannot address every use case for Harvard websites. In some cases, internal Harvard teams may build or work with a third party to develop a custom site, which, once launched, will require hosting. Pantheon hosting is a great option for web developers and website administrators who will be managing their sites independently. In June, 2020 Harvard established a Master Services Agreement (MSA) that brings contractual consistency, reduced pricing, and a dedicated team at Pantheon to on-board and support site owners. Pantheon’s hosting packages are designed to accommodate a wide range of site types, from simple/low traffic to complex/highly trafficked. Benefits of Pantheon Vetted: Harvard terms and contract riders already account for PII, GDPR, and accessibility. Pantheon will assess your needs then capture in an Order Form that references the MSA. Pricing: A standard Harvard price book which includes 30% discount off platform and value-added services Support: Diamond Level support for all Harvard sites with a dedicated account and support team On-boarding and migration services are provided at no cost HarvardKey integration w/ the Pantheon Dashboard Who is Responsible for Support? Pantheon provides on-boarding and migration support for new sites. Once a site is launched, Pantheon’s role is to provide the infrastructure and hosting management platform. See the Pantheon site for technical details. Please note: Custom sites built by internal Harvard teams or third party agencies will require specific Drupal or WordPress expertise to successfully setup and maintain the site.

Web Publishing & Hosting,Video Hosting Options,"DESCRIPTION: Currently, Harvard Web Publishing recommends two options for your video hosting needs: the Harvard Youtube channel, or your own individual channel on Vimeo. If you need assistance with video production, the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning has created a list of groups and resources that can help you produce and edit instructional video. STEP-BY-STEP Guide: The Harvard Youtube Channel The Harvard Youtube channel features videos about life and learning taking place at Harvard – from lectures by faculty to vignettes about student life. The channel reaches a worldwide audience, with some videos receiving millions of views. You are encouraged to submit videos for consideration for the central Harvard Youtube channel, provided they meet the criteria listed below. You will then be able to embed the video into your OpenScholar website. Hosting is free. Vimeo If your video is not meant for wide public viewing, or if you only want the video to appear on your website, Vimeo may be a better option. Vimeo offers a free version that allows you to upload videos and use the embed code on your website. For $84 a year, the Vimeo Plus option provides the ability to completely hide the video so that it only appears on your website, along with more storage. Choosing the best option The suggested option depends upon the content of your video, production value, and intended audience, as detailed below. Follow the steps below to determine how to best host your video: 1. Content – Is your video: a. Of interest to a wide audience, and/or academic in nature? Examples include Harvard faculty lectures or research, panel discussions, or a showcase of student work. Yes, go to #2. b. Administrative, or for a very small audience. Examples include videos intended only for Harvard employees, training videos intended for a specific group of people. Yes, go to #5. 2. Visibility – Is your video: a. Content intended for a large audience, meaning anyone can watch it, including people outside of Harvard. Yes, go to #3. b. Content that is not intended for a large audience (should not viewable except on your website). Yes, go to #5. 3. Production value – Does the video have: a. High production value: video file is at least 640 x 360, audio is sync with the video, subject can be seen clearly (not pixelated), and lighting is adequate. Yes, go to #4. b. Lower production value: video size is smaller than 640 x 360, audio is out of sync, video is noticeably grainy, dark, or washed out. Yes, go to #5. 4. Video Format – Is the video: a. In a web-ready format (.MOV or MP4)? Yes, submit for consideration on the Harvard Youtube channel. b. In another format? Yes. First convert the video to .MOV or .MP4 following the compression guidelines, then submit for consideration on the Harvard Youtube channel. 5. Consider using Vimeo for your department’s video hosting needs. Try to consolidate the number of accounts if possible. For example, if your department has multiple websites with video, try to host the video in one central account. This will make it easier to keep track of your department’s videos. Keep in mind that in order for your video to meet accessibility guidelines, it should have captions. Read more about video captions and preferred vendors on the Harvard Online Accessibility site's Media Accessibility Resources and Vimeo’s documentation for creating captions. See more about accessibility in general on the Harvard Guidelines site."

Web Publishing & Hosting,Tracking Google Analytics (GA4) on your OpenScholar Website,"Starting July 1st, 2023, Google Analytics will stop tracking web traffic on Universal Analytics (UA), which is the old version of Google Analytics. They have instructed all users to migrate to the newest version, GA4. OpenScholar at Harvard is running on Drupal 7, which is not natively compatible with GA4. However there is a manual workaround to track your OpenScholar website traffic using GA4, before you transition away from OpenScholar. Instructions Creating the GA4 Property & Data Stream Sign in to your preferred Google account here: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web Create a Google Analytics Account if you do not already have one, or do not have permissions to add more Properties to your current account. Navigate to Admin in the bottom left: then Create Account in the upper left: Give the Account a name based on your group or department and select your data sharing preferences Click Next Create a new Property.

Web Publishing & Hosting,How to launch your CampusPress site,"Guide of items to consider when launching your CampusPress website. Before Launch Quality Assurance Reviewing every page on your site before launch is helpful for catching last minute usability and accessibility issues. Here is a common, non-exhaustive checklist for common content quality and digital accessibility items to check for. There is also a built-in accessibility checker plugin that is enabled on your CampusPress site by default called Accessible Content, which will help catch some of these items–however manual review is also required. Broken links. Tip: use Ctrl/Cmd while clicking to open links in a new tab to more efficiently check for broken links. Using Siteimprove (see below) can scan for broken links after your site is live. Clear, specific link text. Do not use “read more” or “click here” for link text, or have repeating link text on the same page. Writing helpful links Links should not open in a new tab. This causes mobile and accessibility issues. The exception is if the link is a form or another interactive function. Alt text. Provide visual description of images for non-sighted site visitors. Write good alt text to describe images Heading structure / semantic markup. Use logical heading structure (e.g., Heading 2, Heading 3), mark bulleted or numbered lists, use tables for tabular data (not layout) and have proper heading rows/columns. Identify headings, lists, and tables Text formatting. Remove underlines from non-linked text and avoid use of italics (harder to read in a digital format) Content inaccuracy / misspellings Reading level. Website content should be written in clear, plain language. A common bar to aim for is a Sophomore in high school reading level Site structure. Breadcrumbs navigation / parent pages and menu item labels should be consistent / accurate Mobile view. Check a subset of pages to ensure proper stacking on mobile devices Read more about accessibility best practices on the Digital Accessibility Services website and sign up for the Digital Accessibility for Content Creators and Writing for the Web trainings. Make a copy of your old site Search to see if there is already a recent archive taken of your site on the Harvard University Archives. If not, request a scan from the library archives of your old site by emailing archives_wax@harvard.edu. You can also take advantage of tools like the Wayback Machine or Site Sucker to save html copies of your site, or simply copy over important content into Word or PDF documents. Domain For most sites, you can launch with the default URL, sites.harvard.edu/site-title. For some sites, such as for departments, labs, or other groups, you may want to request a new harvard.edu subdomain. For sites with an existing custom domain, you can submit a ticket to schedule the repointing of your domain to CampusPress. Request a new domain or use an existing domain During Launch Account for possible downtime for sites with existing domains Sites that are already live could have some downtime when switching the URL. It could be as little as 15 minutes, but could be a couple of hours. A new website could take up to 48 hours to fully propagate across the world wide web. Plan ahead by scheduling your site launch when you don’t anticipate higher than usual traffic. Change site visibility to public By default when your site is provisioned, it is set to “Discourage search engines from indexing this site”. For sites intended for the public, you should change your site visibility to “Allow search engines to index this site”. This will let Google and other search engines know that your content is ready to be indexed. If you are using the default URL or have a new domain requested, this can be done at any time after the domain is applied. If you are scheduling a site launch for an existing domain, HUIT will typically change this setting for you at the time of launch. This setting is found in the Dashboard > Settings > Reading. Read more on site visibility in CampusPress. Briefly review your site after domain is applied Do a brief click-through on the public facing view of your site to make sure the site is functioning as intended and links are working properly. If there are high trafficked pages that are broken (you can check immediately after launch on Google), you can request to enable the Safe Redirects Manager plugin to aid in the domain transition of your new site. After Launch / Maintaining Your Site Send out an announcement after a “soft launch” If you would like to announce your new website in an email blast or social media post, wait at least two days for the site to fully propagate. It is a good idea to wait at least a week to use as a “soft launch”, so issues can be caught before distributing to a wider audience. Siteimprove Siteimprove is a third-party service that scans your website for accessibility issues, broken links, misspelled words, and more. Request a Siteimprove account (HarvardKey required) and your site will be scanned periodically (roughly every few days). This tool helps with actively maintaining your site over time, particularly when you set up monthly reports. Setup Google Analytics Google Analytics can help you track web traffic to your site, and in CampusPress, some of that data can be pulled into the Dashboard of your site. Follow these instructions to set up Google Analytics for your CampusPress site. Submit to Google Search Console If your site is on the larger side, and you want to speed up the process of Google indexing or reindexing your site, you can submit your site to Google. Setup a new property in the Google Search Console and reach out to the CampusPress help desk to enable the plugin to verify site ownership. This step will not make a noticeable difference for small sites, and usually search engines index sites within two weeks. Managing Site Administrators It is the responsibility of the site owner or administrators to add and remove users who will manage the content of their websites. The site owner is the point of contact for the university about the website and this should be kept up to date as well. The site owner in CampusPress is labeled as the Site Administration Email Address, and can be found under Settings > General as found in this article. Please update this as there are staff transitions."
Web Publishing & Hosting,FAQ: Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use Site Removals for HMS-affiliated Site Owners,"What are the Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use? Why is my website not in compliance with the Terms of Use? Following a recently completed audit of all Harvard OpenScholar websites, Harvard University Information Technology (HUIT) has identified websites that do not meet its Terms of Use. HUIT has sent email notifications to site owners for one of the following reasons: You are a benefits-eligible Harvard employee or currently enrolled, degree-seeking student and it’s been over a year since your site was last updated. Under the Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use, sites that are not updated for more than 12 months are subject to removal. These sites are scheduled to be removed on Friday, January 20, 2023. OR Under the Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use, websites are available only to benefits-eligible Harvard employees or currently enrolled, degree-seeking students. Harvard web creation services are not available to individuals employed by hospitals or research institutions affiliated with Harvard Medical School. For those who are not eligible for a Harvard-managed website, these sites are scheduled to be removed on March 31, 2023. Additionally, please note that site owners who are not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar website are also not eligible for an hms.harvard.edu domain name, and it will be removed when the site is removed. What should I do if my site is not in compliance with the Terms of Use? Per #1 above, if you are eligible for a Harvard-managed website and your site has not been updated for more than 12 months, please review these options carefully and take the appropriate action: If you still need this site to remain active or if you believe this email has been sent in error, please complete this form as soon as possible. You will receive an immediate confirmation that your request has been submitted, and final advisement will be sent in the coming weeks (response time will depend on the volume of requests). If you no longer need your site but want to keep some of the site’s content, create a backup copy of files and other site content. If you no longer need your site and don’t want to keep any of the site’s content, you don’t need to take any action. We’ll remove the site and its content on Friday, January 20. Per #2 above, if you are not eligible for a Harvard-managed website, please review these options carefully and take the appropriate action: If you believe this email has been sent in error and you are a benefits-eligible Harvard employee or a currently enrolled, degree-seeking student whose site is still required for Harvard use, please complete this form as soon as possible. You will receive an immediate confirmation that your request has been submitted, and final advisement will be sent in the coming weeks (response time will depend on the volume of requests). If you want to keep any of the site’s non-proprietary content, you can manually copy and paste it to another website service or explore web hosting options at your current institution. This transition must be completed before Friday, March 31. For a list of web creation services contacts at each HMS-affiliated institution, visit the Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Affiliate/hospital-based community” + expansion. If you don’t want to keep any of the site’s content, you don’t need to take any action. We’ll remove the site and its content on Friday, March 31. Has Harvard changed its OpenScholar eligibility requirements? The Terms of Use, including eligibility requirements, specify that site creation is available only to benefits-eligible Harvard employees and currently enrolled, degree-seeking students. When users signed-up for an OpenScholar site they were required to attest to these terms of use. However, given the self-service nature of the Harvard OpenScholar platform, no gating mechanisms were put in place to prevent those who had a Harvard ID but did not meet the eligibility requirements from creating a site. I have updated my site and meet the eligibility requirements for site ownership. Do I still need to complete and submit the Terms of Use Site Removal Response Form? Yes, you still need to complete this form. This will help ensure your site is taken off the list of those scheduled to be removed, assuming that you are a benefits-eligible Harvard employee or you are a currently enrolled, degree-seeking student. You will receive an immediate confirmation that your request has been submitted, and final advisement will be sent in the coming weeks (response time will depend on the volume of requests). I’m employed at an HMS-affiliated hospital/institution. Are there web creation services available at my primary institution? Please reach out to your primary institution’s IT and/or communications team to determine what resources are available locally for website creation. For a list of appropriate contacts at each affiliate institution, visit the HMS Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Affiliate/hospital-based community” + expansion. Is Harvard able to export my OpenScholar website for me? Unfortunately, OpenScholar does not have an export capability. This is a limitation of the platform. If I am not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar site, can I keep my hms.harvard.edu domain name? If you are not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar website, you are also not eligible for an hms.harvard.edu domain name and it will be shut down when your site is removed. Visit the HMS Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Requesting an HMS domain” + expansion for eligibility criteria for HMS domain names. Is Harvard able to redirect my OpenScholar URL to a new location? Harvard is able to offer a temporary redirect of your old URL to a new URL for a period of 60 days. Note that this is only available at the top level. That is, any URL of the form https://youroldsite-url/some/sub/page would be redirected to https://yournewsite-url/. Please complete this form and use the Request Additional Assistance field. If I am not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar site, can I transfer my site to someone who does meet the eligibility requirements? Generally, no. In addition to the site owner needing to be eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar site, the content has to be relevant to the site owner’s individual academic pursuits at Harvard. For example, a faculty member employed at an HMS-affiliated institution would not be permitted to transfer their lab or project website to a currently-enrolled, degree-seeking student because the purpose of the site is broader than that student’s individual academic pursuits at Harvard. In addition, there is no ability to move an OpenScholar website in its entirety to another site. Therefore, if you are employed at an HMS-affiliated hospital/institution, please reach out to your primary institution’s IT and/or communications team to determine what resources are available locally for website creation. For a list of appropriate contacts at each affiliate institution, visit the HMS Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Affiliate/hospital-based community” + expansion. If I am not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar site, can I use the Harvard University or Harvard Medical School logo on my new externally hosted website? Please refer to the Policy on the Use of the Harvard Names and Insignias, as well as the HMS Identity Guide. For those faculty and staff who are paid by and whose labs/programs are based at an HMS-affiliated hospital or research institute, websites should follow the branding guidelines of your primary institution. Please see the HMS Affiliate Identity Guide webpage for more information. If you have questions about the affiliate identity guidelines or design specifics, email design@hms.harvard.edu. Inquiries regarding proposed uses of the HMS name and/or logo must be shared for advance review by the HMS Use of Name Committee at UseofName@hms.harvard.edu. I was able to create an OpenScholar site, so does that mean I am eligible to keep it? The Terms of Use, including eligibility requirements, specify that site creation is available only to benefits-eligible Harvard employees and currently enrolled, degree-seeking students. When users signed-up for an OpenScholar site they were required to attest to these terms of use. However, given the self-service nature of the Harvard OpenScholar platform, no gating mechanisms were put in place to prevent those who had a Harvard ID but did not meet the eligibility requirements from creating a site. As part of a recent Harvard OpenScholar audit, Harvard University IT identified websites that are not in compliance with the Terms of Use and, therefore, whose associated costs and resources cannot be covered by the University. Notification emails were sent to site owners who do not meet the eligibility requirements, along with a timeline for removing these sites. I have had my OpenScholar website for quite some time. Can it be grandfathered in? There is no provision in the Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use that “grandfathers” in any websites. Does Harvard need my consent to remove my site? Harvard reserves the right to remove sites that do not meet the Terms of Use. Please refer to the Termination and Changes section of the Terms of Use. I can’t access my site. What should I do? If you do not need to keep your site or any of its non-proprietary content, you don’t need to take any action. If you need to access your site to copy and paste any non-proprietary content, please complete the Terms of Use Site Removal Response Form. You will receive an immediate confirmation that your request has been submitted, and final advisement will be sent in the coming weeks (response time will depend on the volume of requests). If I have a Harvard Catalyst Profile page, can I edit it to include some of the information from my previous Harvard OpenScholar page? Harvard Catalyst “Profiles” creates searchable and interactive online profiles of all faculty at Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. It is powered by the free, open source Profiles Research Networking Software (RNS). These pages are automatically populated for the more than 24,000 faculty, who can edit their own profiles to add education, awards, research narratives, website links, YouTube videos, presentations, and related content. Click here to search for your faculty Profile page, and visit the Harvard Catalyst Profiles webpage for more information on why and how to use this resource and to learn about its capabilities. Please note that Harvard Catalyst Profile pages do not provide the same level of customization as Harvard OpenScholar webpages. If you are looking for more customization and are employed at an HMS-affiliated institution, visit the Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Affiliate/hospital-based community” + expansion for the web creation service contact at your primary institution."

Web Publishing & Hosting,CampusPress Plugins and Functionality,"The Harvard Web Publishing (HWP) team takes a thoughtful and deliberate approach when it comes to adding new features and functionality in CampusPress, particularly when it comes to enabling plugins. Our goal is to provide a stable, scalable, and secure platform for all users while still allowing for customization and flexibility to meet the content needs of your site. With the release of the modern block editor (a.k.a, Gutenberg), the need for plugins in WordPress has significantly decreased. Some functionality (e.g., directory feature) is tied to the theme, while other functionality (e.g., text and image formatting) is tied to blocks. Using configuration options in the Dashboard, Customizer, and the 60+ block types available provide ample opportunities to customize your website and add extra functionality. However, there are certain features where plugin usage is the best approach. For each new plugin under consideration, HWP and the CampusPress team review for usefulness, maintainability, security, accessibility, and usability. We prioritize plugins that would benefit the larger CampusPress community, provide functionality that the theme or blocks do not currently provide, as well as those that are well-maintained, regularly updated, and have a large user base. While there are other plugins enabled in the background, the following are the plugins viewable to site builders in the Dashboard to activate: Accessible Content: A built-in accessibility checker that checks your pages and posts for potential accessibility issues Calendar+: An accessible events manager. Create, manage, and share your calendar and upcoming events Disable Comments Completely: Disables comments on posts by default Duplicate Posts & Pages: A quick way to duplicate or clone a page or post. Helpful for re-using complex page layouts Coblocks: Adds over twenty extra blocks to the block editor (some are excluded for accessibility reasons) WP SMO: Improves the way content is displayed when shared on a social media website Simple SEO: Quick and easy tool for building a solid foundation for an SEO-friendly website. Can be used to submit your site to the Google. Our team recommends using the configuration options available within the available plugins, the theme Customizer, and the block editor available to build out your site. The CampusPress help desk (contact@campuspress.com) is happy to help you navigate these nuances and find the best solution for your needs within the Harvard CampusPress structure."
Web Publishing & Hosting,Don't forget - retire your old site!,"When launching a new website, it's important to retire your old site. Part of the going live process should include notifying the former hosting provider that you've moved on and the old site can be retired. Typically, this is a simple request to ithelp@harvard.edu or your school's IT team. A few tips... Consider backing up your old site in case you need to recover legacy data. Desktop apps, such as Sitesucker, can be helpful. Historical versions of the old site might be viewable using the WayBack Machine. If you have a few specific, high-traffic pages where the URL has changed you can set up a page level redirect in OpenScholar for those URLs. After a few months, retire page-level redirects for non-existent URLs – over time, users will learn to navigate the new site and update their bookmarks."

Wired & Wireless Networks,Register a device on the Harvard University wireless network,"These instructions are for members of the Harvard community who need to register devices on the Harvard University network. This network should only be used for devices that cannot connect to Harvard Secure, such as some gaming consoles and media devices. If you are trying to connect a laptop, computer, or phone, you should first follow these instructions for connecting to Harvard Secure. Harvard Secure is the preferred network, and your device can likely connect. These instructions won't work for wireless speakers or printers, which don't work on campus. Connect a device to Harvard University wireless network Connect to the Harvard University wireless network and visit http://getonline.harvard.edu Select I have a HarvardKey Click on Connect a Specialty Device on the bottom. You will be redirected to authenticate with your Harvard Key credentials. Upon successful authentication, you will redirected to http://getonline.harvard.edu to register your device. To complete the registration, enter a device name and accept the terms of use. Click Create. Your device should now be registered. It may take up to 60 seconds for network access to be enabled, at which point you may begin to browse, check email, or access your apps. Important Note: When registering devices on the wireless network (Alexa, PS4, watch, etc) from another computer. Make sure the device is either powered off for at least 5 minutes before registering the device (if the device has been already been registered it will need to be powered off for at least 5 minutes after registration). In order for the device to be put into an active registered role, it needs to age out of our wireless controllers so the next time it will have access to the Internet. If you do not do this the device will remain in an unregistered role and will be unable to connect out. Registration expiration The first time you register a device, its registration will expire in one year. Then, every time you connect to the network, the expiration will be ""now plus 400 days."" This way, you will never need to re-register a device unless it hasn't been used in 400 days. Need help? If you weren't able to connect your device to the Harvard University wireless network, submit a ticket or call 617-495-7777."

Logged into VPN, received no error messages but cannot see my applications/servers This indicates that you have logged on to the default Harvard VPN tunnel but not your specific application/server tunnel. Please follow the instructions on how to connect to VPN found here. Slow Connection while on VPN Please note that the Cisco AnyConnect app routes all of your internet traffic through Harvard's networks, so the same policies for using Harvard's networks apply to a Harvard VPN connection at home. VPN is a technology that is used for securely accessing Harvard resources from outside of Harvard's on-campus networks. However, it can decrease the speed of your internet connection depending on a number of factors. This reduction in speed is due to the process of encrypting your internet traffic to make your transactions (of data) safe and secure. If you feel as though your connection is slower than expected, you can take some steps at home to check your internet speed and potentially determine a cause. How to Check Internet Speed To check your internet speed, remember to disconnect from VPN. Use https://www.speedtest.net or a similar online internet speed test. Ensure the test is from a reputable source. Once you click Go, the test will begin and you'll have your internet speed test results within a few moments. If you are starting with a lower speed internet, there is the possibility that you may face connection issues if connected to Harvard VPN for a majority of the workday. Try to lower the use of bandwidth when requiring the use of Harvard VPN on lower speed networks, including limiting streaming video and limiting the number of devices connected to your home network during that time. For issues installing on Mac OS High Sierra or Linx please see KB0015695 Need more help? If you would like assistance with VPN, contact your local Service Desk or, for HUIT-supported users, submit a ticket to the HUIT Service Desk via the IT Help Portal."

Wired & Wireless Networks,Initially Populate VPN Tunnels using Grouper,"This article describes the steps to initially populate VPN tunnels via Grouper and is intended for VPN Tunnel Administrators. As of May 2023, Harvard will use Grouper groups to manage who has access to each tunnel. This article augments the VPN Tunnel Administration using Grouper KB. Tunnel Administrators are responsible for initially populating their Grouper tunnel group(s) which grants them access to various servers and applications. Reference groups are read-only groups updated daily from HR and Student systems to contain only those with a current Harvard affiliation. When tunnel admins use reference groups, they will not need to self-audit their tunnel group when individuals join or leave the university because the update will be automatic. For security and audit purposes, using reference groups is the preferred and recommended method of populating your VPN tunnel group. Your tunnel group can include both reference groups and other users you manually add by name, if necessary. A video of what is covered below is available VPN Grouper Walkthrough Analyze your VPN tunnel users Before populating the tunnel group in Grouper, analyze who the users of the VPN tunnel should be. This will help in determining if there is a Grouper Reference group that can be used instead of adding users one by one to populate your tunnel group. Some questions to consider: Are employees included based on their department, or some other criteria such as employee classification of staff, faculty, etc.? Are Harvard Sponsored Roles such as consultants, contractors and vendors, to be included? Are students in a particular school to be included? A current student in the reference groups for students in a particular school is defined as students who are Registered, Pending, Study Abroad, On Leave Paying Facilities Fees, or in Special Program-SP. Are class participants included? Class participants are cross-registered students from outside and within Harvard, DCE students, and many Exec Ed program students. Determine if Department Reference Groups are appropriate Grouper already has Department-based reference groups for Employee and Harvard Sponsored Roles for each of the ~3,500 active HR departments. Each group is a rollup of all individuals within a department and any of its sub-departments. If your tunnel users are all in a specific department, or can roll up into a higher level department, then using a department reference group will alleviate the need for you to maintain the membership of your tunnel group. You may include multiple department reference groups in your tunnel group, as well as add individuals by name. To determine what departments your tunnel users are in: Take a sampling of current users in your tunnel and look them up by their name in the Harvard Web Directory. This will show their department name, e.g., CADM^HUIT^TPS^IAM. Determine if the departments from your sampling roll up into a higher level department that is appropriate to use instead of the individual departments, e.g., CADM^HUIT^TPS. Log into Grouper https://grouper.iam.harvard.edu/ and paste the department name into the search box in the upper right corner of the Grouper screen. The search results will show the department reference groups for the department you entered. Other groups may also show in the result set but the department reference groups are in the harvard:ref:dept: folder. Employee department reference group names begin with EMPL- Harvard Sponsored Role department reference group names begin with HSR- Note the department code that is appended to the reference group name, e.g., 104013. This code will make it easier to add the group to your tunnel group. Click on the department reference group to bring it up in the main Grouper window. Inspect the members listed and perhaps compare them with your current tunnel users in the noc portal. Use the back button on your browser to easily return to the search results. Determine if Student Reference Groups are appropriate Grouper has reference groups containing current students and class participants for each school. Navigate to the school folder in Grouper and open the students folder to view the available student and class participants reference groups for that school, e.g., harvard:ref:affiliations:schools:hds:students Click on the department reference groups to inspect the members of the group and perhaps compare them with your current tunnel users in the noc portal. If a desired reference group is not available you can request to have it created. Navigate to the VPN tunnel folder in Grouper In Grouper, under Browser folders, navigate to the VPN tunnels folder by clicking the folders harvard>apps>vpn>tunnels. Click on the “tunnels” folder to bring it up in the main Grouper window. See Navigate groups and folders in Grouper for more assistance. You should see one or more tunnel folders named “tunnel-#”, where # is the tunnel # which corresponds to tunnel names that you administer. See HUIT VPN tunnel name mapping for use with Grouper authentication if you do not know your tunnel number. Alternatively, you can search for your tunnel by entering the tunnel name in the Grouper search box, and then click on it in the search results to bring it up in the main window. Click on the “tunnel-#” folder for the tunnel you want to administer to bring it up in the main window. The tunnel name should be visible in the folder description. You should see 3 groups in the tunnel-# folder: vpn-admins-tunnel-# People in this group are administrators of the tunnel. They can manage the other two groups which determine who has access to the tunnel. They can also add/remove other tunnel administrators to this group. vpn-users-tunnel-#-members This is the group where reference groups and individual people are added/removed to in order to manage who has access to the tunnel. vpn-users-tunnel-# This is the group that is used in the HarvardKey registration. It intersects the vpn-users-tunnel-#-members group with a broad gencom tunnel members group to ensure that only those with an active Harvard affiliation can access the tunnel. Tunnel administrators do not need to edit or manage this group. Populate the VPN tunnel group with Reference group(s) Click on the vpn-users-tunnel-#-members group to bring it up in the main Grouper window. If the group is empty you will not see any names listed. Click the +Add members button. In the Member name or ID: box enter the department name (e.g. CADM^HUIT^TPS^IAM) or department code (e.g. 104013). You will see spinning ellipses as Grouper searches, and then a list of one or more matches. Do not press the “enter” button on your keyboard after entering the information. If you do then Grouper will give a “No matches found” error message. If this happens, simply backspace over the last character you entered and type it again to restart the search. The match list shows any group that includes the department name or department code. Use this information to select the correct department reference group. Select the group name beginning with EMPL- to add all employees in the department and any sub-departments. Select the group name beginning with HSR- to add all Harvard Sponsored Roles (e.g. consultants, contingent workers, vendors) in the department and any sub-departments. Keep the Default privileges selected and click the Add button to add the department reference group to your tunnel. See Add and remove people in Grouper groups for more assistance. Repeat this process to add additional department reference groups. To add any other reference group to the tunnel users group, follow the same steps as adding a department reference group, only in the Member name or ID: box enter ref: followed by a space and all or a portion of the reference group name (e.g. ref: HDS Students) and then select the appropriate group from the list provided. Starting the search with ref: will limit it to just reference groups. To see what other reference groups are available in Grouper, navigate groups in the harvard:ref:affiliations: folder. Note that the reference groups will be added with a Direct group membership, and the people in the reference group will be added with an Indirect group membership. Indirect members will be added and removed automatically as the department reference group is updated daily. You cannot manually remove indirect members of the group. If you cannot use a Reference Group to populate your VPN Tunnel You can either add people manually one by one, or you can export the current members of the tunnel in noc portal and then populate the VPN tunnel group using the Grouper import feature from a .csv file. Please remember that adding members to your tunnel by this method will require you to manually remove them should they no longer require access to the VPN Tunnel you administer. Add a person directly to the tunnel users group: Click the +Add members button. In the Member name or ID: box enter the first and last name, or HUID, NetID, or email of the person you want to add to the group. You will see spinning ellipses as Grouper searches, and then a list of one or more matches. Do not press the “enter” button on your keyboard after entering the information. If you do then Grouper will give a “No matches found” error message. If this happens, simply backspace over the last character you entered and type it again to restart the search. The match list shows the person’s preferred name, official email address, NetID, HUID, and other unique identifiers. Use this information to select the correct person from the list. People who have left Harvard will normally not display a Harvard email address. Keep the Default privileges selected and click the Add button to add the person as a member of the group. Repeat this process to add additional people as direct members of the group. Import current members of the VPN tunnel In the noc portal, create a .csv file containing only HUIDs of those you want to import into the Grouper tunnel group. Click on the vpn-users-tunnel-#-members group to bring it up in the main Grouper window. Click the Group actions button and select Import members from the dropdown. In How to specify members, select Import a file. Click Choose File, and select the .csv file from the noc portal export. Click the Submit button to add those in the .csv file to the group. See Add and remove people in bulk to Grouper groups using import for more assistance. Adding members via import will add people directly to the tunnel group and will require you to manually remove them should they no longer require access to the VPN Tunnel you administer. Review who is in the populated VPN tunnel group After adding all department or other reference groups, and any individual members to the vpn-users-tunnel-#-members group, you may have a long list of members displayed. The main window displays only the first 50 groups or people in the group. To navigate through the list of members click First, Prev, Next, Last at the bottom of the window. See Navigate groups and folders in Grouper for more assistance. In the Filter for: drop-down select Has direct membership, then click the Apply filter button. You will see the reference groups that have been added, and the names of people who have been added directly, or imported to the group. To see if a specific person is in the group: In the Filter for: option, click the Reset button to list all members of the group. In the Member name box, enter all or a portion of the person’s preferred name, then click the Apply filter button. Note: A person’s preferred name is what is seen in the Harvard Web Directory and may be different from their official name.
