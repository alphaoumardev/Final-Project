Review the confirmation email which will be sent to your recovery email address. If you were prompted to enter a recovery email address during the claiming process, go to your recovery email and find the verification email from Harvard. Click the link or copy it into a web browser and enter your confirmation code. You must do this step within 30 minutes of the last step. Next Steps Activate multifactor authentication Many applications require multifactor authentication. Activate multifactor authentication with HarvardKey to make sure you can access all the Harvard resources you need. If you're an alumni, you aren't required to do this. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of security designed to ensure that you’re the only person who can access your account. It requires that you verify your identity using multiple types of information, such as something you know (a password), something you have (a registered phone or hardware token) or something you are (your face or fingerprint). Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Learn more about the phased rollout of this technology. Update Stored Passwords To avoid being locked out of your account, update any applications where you have your password stored, such as password managers like 1Password, LastPass or Apple Keychain. This also includes standalone apps (particularly mobile apps) for services like Google Drive or Office 365. You will also need to update your password on mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail on your tablet, phone and computer. Need help?

Accounts and Authentication,Prepare to leave Harvard University,"This page summarizes what happens to your online access once you leave Harvard University/your role becomes inactive. It also details when these access changes take effect. Access depends on your active affiliations - it is derived both from (1) your role (e.g. faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate) and also (2) your school or department. When you no longer have an active role your access will either end immediately, or it may continue for an extended period (known as a grace period). People can have more than one role at the same time. In that case, a status change that ends one of your roles will only affect access that is based on that role. For example, when a student graduates they will still have an active alumni role. That active role doesn't provide them the same access as when they were a student though. Another example would be a staff who retires. These role transitions affect access. Please note the following information does not apply to affiliations for roles at Harvard Business School. If you have a role associated with HBS, please ask the school's IT service desk what to do with your files and accounts when you leave the University and to confirm with them when your access to Harvard resources and services will end.

Here is some basic guidance to get you started with retaining your records and data, plus specific recommendations for each file type. General record recommendations Talk to co-workers and supervisors about the records you control that they may need access to after you leave Consult an approved Harvard records schedule like the General Records Schedule to determine whether they should be: Destroyed Sent to the Archives Passed on to a colleague These will be records which for some reason should not yet be destroyed or sent to the Archives You may have records going to multiple colleagues Note that retention and disposition (destruction or archives transfer) rules apply to paper, email, and electronic records. In addition to checking your own personal storage spaces (desk drawers, personal file cabinets and server space), be sure to check shared spaces, too. This is important where you are the primary custodian of groups of records in shared spaces (public file cabinets, group server space). Paper records Destroying paper records Shred them, either on-site or through a Records Management Services (RMS) destruction event Passing to a colleague Transfer them to the most appropriate colleague. Make sure that they are adequately labeled. Sending to the Archives Consult the RMS web site and/or contact RMS for instructions on sending paper records to the Archives Email Destroy emails and attachments Depending on the application, empty the trash or purge deleted messages Pass to a colleague In order to keep attachments connected to messages, this will likely require IT assistance Send to Harvard Archives Contact Records Management Services (RMS) to discuss the transfer of these records. IT will likely need to be involved Attachments must remain connected The particular email format must be acceptable to the Archives An appropriate transfer mechanism must be determined. For example, copying to a DVD might violate Harvard security policies Other Electronic Records Backing Up Personal and Departmental Files To learn how to backup your files from Microsoft 365, Dropbox and Google, please see this knowledge article. Qualtrics survey data When you leave Harvard, you will no longer be able to access your surveys or survey data through your Harvard Qualtrics account. Learn more about what happens to your Qualtrics survey data. Poll Everywhere data When you leave Harvard, you will no longer be able to access your Poll Everywhere data with your Harvard Key. If you wish to retain your data, please submit a ticket with Poll Everywhere Support Canvas When you leave Harvard, you will continue to have access to your Canvas sites via your HarvardKey, but course sites may be concluded and then your access will be limited. If you are a teaching staff member and would like to reuse your content at another institution, or have a copy for your own records, we suggest you export your course content before you leave. If you are a student and would like a copy of your assignment submissions, you may download assignment submissions from all of your courses as a single zip file. Adobe Creative Cloud Assets Prior to deactivation of your Harvard Adobe License, you may migrate assets stored in the Adobe Creative Cloud to a personal account that you can take with you. Details involved in this process can be found here: https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/migrate-student-assets.ug.html Please be sure to read the information before performing your migration so that you understand what will and will not be migrated. Be sure to read the FAQ at the bottom of the page as well. Some Important things to know about the migration process: Not all data qualifies for automatic migration. Some assets may need to be downloaded, moved, or re-created manually. The Personal Adobe account you create must be a new one with an email address that is not already attached to an Adobe ID. Free Adobe Personal accounts include 2GB of storage. The University licenses include 100GB of storage. If you have more than 2GB in your University Adobe account, ALL of your qualifying data will be migrated to the new account, but you will not be able to upload additional data to your new account until you either purchase more storage space or remove enough files to be under the 2GB limitation. To start your Asset migration for graduating students, please go to the following link: https://graduation.adobe.com/ Zoom Assets If you have any recurring meetings, please ask a colleague to create a new meeting series to replace yours, as it will end when your account closes. You can download any recordings you have prior to your last day: https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0067567#h_01F4F8Z2FJCCE6KVBPGHNZEXSC Other electronic records Destroy electronic records Delete the records Empty the recycle bin or trash Pass to a colleague Notify the colleague, with adequate description, of any records that are in shared spaces. Transfer records in personal space to the colleague. This might be done in several ways Transfer via removable media (DVD, thumb drive). Depending on the confidentiality of the records, this might violate Harvard security policies. Coordinate with the colleague to temporarily move the records through shared server space. Be careful, though. Depending on the confidentiality of the records, this might not be a good idea. Consult Information Security to find out more. Have your local IT team move the files directly from your personal server space to your colleague's server space. 1Password Shared vaults Shared vault managers must remove accounts that no longer require access to departmental vaults. Deleted business accounts will be automatically deprovisioned. Family members After the Harvard affiliate's role ends family member(s) will be prompted to enter in a credit card to continue 1Password access. If no payment method is provided, the family accounts go into a read-only mode and cannot be updated. Because the family accounts go into read-only mode, there should be no disruption of service. Student accounts A code will be provided to extend account for 4.25 years after graduation. After the code expires, users will be prompted to enter in a credit card to continue 1Password access."

Accounts and Authentication,Set up a 1Password passkey for use with Okta,"Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. These instructions are for HarvardKey users who want to set up a passkey through a password manager on their computer for multifactor authentication (MFA), which provides an extra layer of security for accounts. 1Password is the recommended password manager for Harvard, and is available to faculty, staff, and students. Passkeys as a security method are a good option when: Your device does not support Okta Verify and you want to use an enhanced login option that does not require a password. You want to use an enhanced login method on a device where you are not the primary user (e.g. library or computer lab machines). You are traveling to a high-risk country. You would like a highly secure backup method in case you experience issues with your primary device. Set up a passkey with 1Password Prior to setting up a passkey, ensure 1Password is ready: Set up your 1Password account, if you have not already done so Add the 1Password browser extension to your browser Turn off your browser’s built in password manager Go to your Okta account settings (login.harvard.edu). Log in with your HarvardKey credentials. Click Manage security methods. Click the set up or set up another button beside the security key or biometric authenticator. Okta will prompt you to authenticate with the security method you last used. Click Set up on the “Set up security methods” prompt, under “Security Key or Biometric Authenticator.” Click Set up, on the “Set up security key or biometric authenticator” prompt. Click Save on the 1Password prompt to Save passkey. The passkey is now saved and will appear as a “Security Key or Biometric Authenticator” on your Okta Dashboard and in 1Password. Using a passkey on a browser with the 1Password extension After successfully setting up your passkey with 1Password for Okta, you can select the passkey as a security method the next time you log into a HarvardKey-protected resource. Sign in with your HarvardKey username. Select Security Key or Biometric Authenticator. Click Sign in on the 1Password pop-up window. Sign in on another device with a passkey If you have 1Password installed on your mobile device you can sign in with your passkey even on devices without 1Password. This is useful when using a computer that is not your primary device, including library, lab or shared computers. To use this method ensure that 1Password is installed and configured on your mobile device (1Password is available for Android and iOS). Sign in with your HarvardKey username. Select Security Key or Biometric Authenticator as your security method. Select Use a phone, tablet, or security key (Chrome) or iPhone, iPad, or Android device (Firefox and Safari). A QR code will be displayed. Scan this code with your mobile device’s camera. Choose 1Password, then follow the steps to sign in. Alternatives to 1Password 1Password is the recommended password manager for those eligible for an account through Harvard. Other options, including Apple Passwords and Google Password Manager, also provide strong security and the ability to synchronize passkeys across devices.

Okta offers enhanced authentication methods that allow you to verify your identity with your fingerprint, facial recognition, or device-specific PIN instead of entering your HarvardKey password. This keeps your account more secure and makes sign-in faster and easier. Okta also supports several alternative authentication methods for occasions when enhanced authentication is not possible or preferred. When is this happening? The transition from Duo to Okta is happening in phases between spring 2025 and spring 2026, based on roles or affiliations. You will be contacted by HUIT or your School’s local IT support when it’s time for you to make the switch. If you want to set up Okta sooner, you can do so at your convenience by following these step-by-step instructions. Do I have to switch to Okta? Yes, eventually. By spring 2026, all HarvardKey users will be required to have set up Okta to continue accessing HarvardKey-protected tools and resources. What do I need to do? Recommended: For the fastest, most secure sign-in experience, we strongly recommend setting up Okta Verify with FastPass enabled on all your devices that you use to access HarvardKey-protected apps and services. Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up Okta Verify with FastPass. Alternative: You can also set up Okta using alternative authentication methods such as hardware tokens, passkeys, or traditional multifactor authentication. Learn more about alternative authentication methods. What is Okta FastPass? At Harvard, we’ve used traditional multifactor (or “two-step”) authentication methods such as push notifications, phone calls, or SMS messages to verify your identity when signing into HarvardKey. Although these reduce the risk of your account being compromised, they still rely on entering a password, which can be stolen, guessed, or phished. With Okta Verify’s FastPass feature, you can verify your identity using your device’s built-in security mechanism (e.g., Touch ID, FaceID, PIN, Windows Hello) instead of entering your HarvardKey password. Sometimes known as “passwordless” authentication, this improves security and makes sign-in faster. You can use FastPass with: Your fingerprint or facial recognition (also known as “biometrics”) using your device’s built-in fingerprint or face authenticators (e.g. Windows Hello, Touch ID, Face ID). Because biometrics are unique to you and stored securely on your device, they are harder to steal, replicate, or hack compared to passwords, which can be guessed or shared. A device-specific PIN or passcode that is encrypted and tied exclusively to your device. Unlike a password, which works on any internet-connected device, this PIN only grants access on the device where it was set up. Even if stolen, a device-specific PIN is useless without physical access to your device. What are the other benefits of Okta FastPass? In addition to significantly improving security, FastPass makes signing in to HarvardKey faster and easier. Since you verify your identity directly on your device, there's no need to enter a password, wait for a push notification, or use a second device like your phone when signing in on your computer. Is my biometric data secure and private?  Yes. Your biometric data (face or fingerprint) is encrypted and stored only on your device—it is never shared with, nor can it be accessed by, Harvard or Okta. It is used solely to unlock access to HarvardKey. If you prefer not to use biometrics, you can opt for a device-specific PIN instead. What if I don’t have my devices with me? If you need to access a HarvardKey-protected tool or resource, but you don’t have access to any of your devices that have Okta set up, you can contact the HUIT Service Desk for help. Are there alternative authentication methods? Yes. If your device doesn’t support Okta Verify or you’re using a shared/public device, you may need to use an alternative authentication method, like a passkey or hardware token. You may also decide to set up an alternative authentication method as a backup. I currently use a YubiKey with Duo. Can I continue to use a YubiKey with Okta? Yes, you can continue to use a YubiKey with Okta. We may need to upgrade your YubiKey to meet Okta security requirements.  Can I still use traditional multifactor authentication? Yes. While we highly recommend setting up enhanced authentication, you can still verify your identity through Okta using a push notification or a unique six-digit one-time code. Okta does not support the use of SMS or phone calls as these are considered less secure verification methods. Learn more about multifactor authentication options. Where can I get help? We understand this is a big change, and we’re here to help. If you need help during the setup process or have questions about authentication methods, contact the HUIT Service Desk or your local IT support.

Accounts,Prepare to leave Harvard University,"This page summarizes what happens to your online access once you leave Harvard University/your role becomes inactive. It also details when these access changes take effect. Access depends on your active affiliations - it is derived both from (1) your role (e.g. faculty, staff, student, or other affiliate) and also (2) your school or department. When you no longer have an active role your access will either end immediately, or it may continue for an extended period (known as a grace period). People can have more than one role at the same time. In that case, a status change that ends one of your roles will only affect access that is based on that role. For example, when a student graduates they will still have an active alumni role. That active role doesn't provide them the same access as when they were a student though. Another example would be a staff who retires. These role transitions affect access. Please note the following information does not apply to affiliations for roles at Harvard Business School. If you have a role associated with HBS, please ask the school's IT service desk what to do with your files and accounts when you leave the University and to confirm with them when your access to Harvard resources and services will end. Accounts and Access Expiration Details By School/Department Staff Sponsored Affiliates or Non-Employee Contingent Workers Grace Period Exceptions FAS Faculty, researchers, and other academic appointments SEAS Faculty Emeritus Faculty College Students Graduate Degree Students Non-Degree Students Cross-Registered Students from outside Harvard What you should do General recommendations Paper records Email Backing up Personal and Departmental Files Qualtrics survey data Poll Everywhere data Canvas Adobe Creative Cloud Assets Zoom Assets Other electronic records Accounts and access expiration details by school and department Staff: Central Admin, FAS, GSD, GSE, HDS, HLS, HMS/SDM, Chan SPH, Radcliffe, SEAS After your last day worked, you lose access to: Microsoft 365: email, calendar, Sharepoint, OneDrive, apps Google Workspace: email, Google Drive and Google Apps (for g.harvard and college.harvard accounts) Shared network drives FAS Account, including unix homedir VPN/Zoom access Adobe Software and Creative Cloud Storage Authorization access to financial and administrative applications, including library resources and intranets Dropbox 1Password (Option to set up paid account.)

Here is some basic guidance to get you started with retaining your records and data, plus specific recommendations for each file type. General record recommendations Talk to co-workers and supervisors about the records you control that they may need access to after you leave Consult an approved Harvard records schedule like the General Records Schedule to determine whether they should be: Destroyed Sent to the Archives Passed on to a colleague These will be records which for some reason should not yet be destroyed or sent to the Archives You may have records going to multiple colleagues Note that retention and disposition (destruction or archives transfer) rules apply to paper, email, and electronic records. In addition to checking your own personal storage spaces (desk drawers, personal file cabinets and server space), be sure to check shared spaces, too. This is important where you are the primary custodian of groups of records in shared spaces (public file cabinets, group server space). Paper records Destroying paper records Shred them, either on-site or through a Records Management Services (RMS) destruction event Passing to a colleague Transfer them to the most appropriate colleague. Make sure that they are adequately labeled. Sending to the Archives Consult the RMS web site and/or contact RMS for instructions on sending paper records to the Archives Email Destroy emails and attachments Depending on the application, empty the trash or purge deleted messages Pass to a colleague In order to keep attachments connected to messages, this will likely require IT assistance Send to Harvard Archives Contact Records Management Services (RMS) to discuss the transfer of these records. IT will likely need to be involved Attachments must remain connected The particular email format must be acceptable to the Archives An appropriate transfer mechanism must be determined. For example, copying to a DVD might violate Harvard security policies Other Electronic Records Backing Up Personal and Departmental Files To learn how to backup your files from Microsoft 365, Dropbox and Google, please see this knowledge article. Qualtrics survey data When you leave Harvard, you will no longer be able to access your surveys or survey data through your Harvard Qualtrics account. Learn more about what happens to your Qualtrics survey data. Poll Everywhere data When you leave Harvard, you will no longer be able to access your Poll Everywhere data with your Harvard Key. If you wish to retain your data, please submit a ticket with Poll Everywhere Support Canvas When you leave Harvard, you will continue to have access to your Canvas sites via your HarvardKey, but course sites may be concluded and then your access will be limited. If you are a teaching staff member and would like to reuse your content at another institution, or have a copy for your own records, we suggest you export your course content before you leave. If you are a student and would like a copy of your assignment submissions, you may download assignment submissions from all of your courses as a single zip file. Adobe Creative Cloud Assets Prior to deactivation of your Harvard Adobe License, you may migrate assets stored in the Adobe Creative Cloud to a personal account that you can take with you. Details involved in this process can be found here: https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/admin-guide.html/enterprise/using/migrate-student-assets.ug.html Please be sure to read the information before performing your migration so that you understand what will and will not be migrated. Be sure to read the FAQ at the bottom of the page as well. Some Important things to know about the migration process: Not all data qualifies for automatic migration. Some assets may need to be downloaded, moved, or re-created manually. The Personal Adobe account you create must be a new one with an email address that is not already attached to an Adobe ID. Free Adobe Personal accounts include 2GB of storage. The University licenses include 100GB of storage. If you have more than 2GB in your University Adobe account, ALL of your qualifying data will be migrated to the new account, but you will not be able to upload additional data to your new account until you either purchase more storage space or remove enough files to be under the 2GB limitation. To start your Asset migration for graduating students, please go to the following link: https://graduation.adobe.com/ Zoom Assets If you have any recurring meetings, please ask a colleague to create a new meeting series to replace yours, as it will end when your account closes. You can download any recordings you have prior to your last day: https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0067567#h_01F4F8Z2FJCCE6KVBPGHNZEXSC Other electronic records Destroy electronic records Delete the records Empty the recycle bin or trash Pass to a colleague Notify the colleague, with adequate description, of any records that are in shared spaces. Transfer records in personal space to the colleague. This might be done in several ways Transfer via removable media (DVD, thumb drive). Depending on the confidentiality of the records, this might violate Harvard security policies. Coordinate with the colleague to temporarily move the records through shared server space. Be careful, though. Depending on the confidentiality of the records, this might not be a good idea. Consult Information Security to find out more. Have your local IT team move the files directly from your personal server space to your colleague's server space. 1Password Shared vaults Shared vault managers must remove accounts that no longer require access to departmental vaults. Deleted business accounts will be automatically deprovisioned. Family members After the Harvard affiliate's role ends family member(s) will be prompted to enter in a credit card to continue 1Password access. If no payment method is provided, the family accounts go into a read-only mode and cannot be updated. Because the family accounts go into read-only mode, there should be no disruption of service. Student accounts A code will be provided to extend account for 4.25 years after graduation. After the code expires, users will be prompted to enter in a credit card to continue 1Password access."

The Alumni Office also provides a detailed FAQ specifically for alumni. What You’ll Need to Claim your Harvardkey Employees, students, program participants, library borrowers, sponsored roles Access to the email address Harvard has on file for you*: This is commonly known as the onboard email. Your Harvard University ID (HUID)*: This is an 8-digit number that is used as a unique identifier at Harvard. Your last name and date of birth: This will help us confirm your identity * If you’re unsure of your HUID or which email address Harvard has on file, contact the person or office responsible for your onboarding to confirm this information. Alumni Access to the primary email address Harvard has on file for you: If you don’t have a primary email address on file, or don’t have access to the one that is on file contact the Alumni & Development Services Office for assistance. Your Harvard Alumni Association ID (HAA ID): This is a 10-digit number, unique to you, which can be found in the footer of any email sent to you by the Harvard Alumni Association, such as HAA Events or the Harvard Alumni Gazette. If you do not know or cannot find your HAA ID, please contact the HAA Help Desk. Your Last Name: You will need to enter your last name as it appears in our records. If applicable, you may instead enter your maiden name or the last name you went by while a student at Harvard. Your Degree Year: If you hold multiple degrees from Harvard, you can search for your record using any one of them. Please only enter one of your degree years (all of your degrees will be visible on your profile in the online directory).

If you already have an official Harvard email, HarvardKey will automatically assign that as your username, and you’ll skip this step. Otherwise, depending on your Harvard affiliation, you’ll be asked to enter the username of your choice, or you’ll be asked to choose a username from a list of options. The system will also ask you to confirm your choice. Click Continue. If prompted, set your recovery email.

Click the link or copy it into a web browser and enter your confirmation code. You must do this step within 30 minutes of the last step. Next Steps Activate multifactor authentication Many applications require multifactor authentication. Activate multifactor authentication with HarvardKey to make sure you can access all the Harvard resources you need. If you're an alumni, you aren't required to do this. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is an extra layer of security designed to ensure that you’re the only person who can access your account. It requires that you verify your identity using multiple types of information, such as something you know (a password), something you have (a registered phone or hardware token) or something you are (your face or fingerprint). Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Learn more about the phased rollout of this technology. Update Stored Passwords To avoid being locked out of your account, update any applications where you have your password stored, such as password managers like 1Password, LastPass or Apple Keychain. This also includes standalone apps (particularly mobile apps) for services like Google Drive or Office 365. You will also need to update your password on mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail on your tablet, phone and computer. Need help?

HarvardKey,Duo to Okta transition: FAQ,"Harvard University is replacing Duo with Okta for identity verification when signing into HarvardKey-protected tools and resources. Okta offers enhanced authentication methods that allow you to verify your identity with your fingerprint, facial recognition, or device-specific PIN instead of entering your HarvardKey password. This keeps your account more secure and makes sign-in faster and easier. Okta also supports several alternative authentication methods for occasions when enhanced authentication is not possible or preferred. When is this happening? The transition from Duo to Okta is happening in phases between spring 2025 and spring 2026, based on roles or affiliations. You will be contacted by HUIT or your School’s local IT support when it’s time for you to make the switch. If you want to set up Okta sooner, you can do so at your convenience by following these step-by-step instructions. Do I have to switch to Okta? Yes, eventually. By spring 2026, all HarvardKey users will be required to have set up Okta to continue accessing HarvardKey-protected tools and resources. What do I need to do? Recommended: For the fastest, most secure sign-in experience, we strongly recommend setting up Okta Verify with FastPass enabled on all your devices that you use to access HarvardKey-protected apps and services. Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up Okta Verify with FastPass. Alternative: You can also set up Okta using alternative authentication methods such as hardware tokens, passkeys, or traditional multifactor authentication. Learn more about alternative authentication methods. What is Okta FastPass? At Harvard, we’ve used traditional multifactor (or “two-step”) authentication methods such as push notifications, phone calls, or SMS messages to verify your identity when signing into HarvardKey. Although these reduce the risk of your account being compromised, they still rely on entering a password, which can be stolen, guessed, or phished. With Okta Verify’s FastPass feature, you can verify your identity using your device’s built-in security mechanism (e.g., Touch ID, FaceID, PIN, Windows Hello) instead of entering your HarvardKey password. Sometimes known as “passwordless” authentication, this improves security and makes sign-in faster. You can use FastPass with: Your fingerprint or facial recognition (also known as “biometrics”) using your device’s built-in fingerprint or face authenticators (e.g. Windows Hello, Touch ID, Face ID). Because biometrics are unique to you and stored securely on your device, they are harder to steal, replicate, or hack compared to passwords, which can be guessed or shared. A device-specific PIN or passcode that is encrypted and tied exclusively to your device. Unlike a password, which works on any internet-connected device, this PIN only grants access on the device where it was set up. Even if stolen, a device-specific PIN is useless without physical access to your device. What are the other benefits of Okta FastPass? In addition to significantly improving security, FastPass makes signing in to HarvardKey faster and easier. Since you verify your identity directly on your device, there's no need to enter a password, wait for a push notification, or use a second device like your phone when signing in on your computer. Is my biometric data secure and private?  Yes. Your biometric data (face or fingerprint) is encrypted and stored only on your device—it is never shared with, nor can it be accessed by, Harvard or Okta. It is used solely to unlock access to HarvardKey. If you prefer not to use biometrics, you can opt for a device-specific PIN instead. What if I don’t have my devices with me? If you need to access a HarvardKey-protected tool or resource, but you don’t have access to any of your devices that have Okta set up, you can contact the HUIT Service Desk for help. Are there alternative authentication methods? Yes. If your device doesn’t support Okta Verify or you’re using a shared/public device, you may need to use an alternative authentication method, like a passkey or hardware token. You may also decide to set up an alternative authentication method as a backup. I currently use a YubiKey with Duo. Can I continue to use a YubiKey with Okta? Yes, you can continue to use a YubiKey with Okta. We may need to upgrade your YubiKey to meet Okta security requirements.  Can I still use traditional multifactor authentication? Yes. While we highly recommend setting up enhanced authentication, you can still verify your identity through Okta using a push notification or a unique six-digit one-time code. Okta does not support the use of SMS or phone calls as these are considered less secure verification methods. Learn more about multifactor authentication options. Where can I get help? We understand this is a big change, and we’re here to help. If you need help during the setup process or have questions about authentication methods, contact the HUIT Service Desk or your local IT support.

HarvardKey,"Set up a hardware token (e.g., YubiKey) for use with Okta","Starting spring 2025, the University will replace Duo with Okta for MFA to securely access HarvardKey-protected resources. Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. These instructions are for HarvardKey users who want to set up a hardware token, such as a YubiKey, for Okta passwordless or multifactor authentication (MFA), to provide an extra layer of security for accounts. A hardware token is a small, key-like device you plug into your computer to verify your identity. The most common hardware token used at Harvard is a YubiKey. YubiKeys with fingerprint sensors or that require a PIN, can be used for passwordless or multifactor authentication. YubiKeys that require a one-time passcode can be used for MFA only. Learn more about hardware tokens here - What Is a Security Token (or Authentication Token) and How Does It Work?. Hardware tokens as a security method are a good option when: Your device does not support passwordless options with Okta Verify and you want to use passwordless authentication. You are traveling to a high-risk country. You regularly use a shared computer, such as a lab computer, where you can’t have Okta Verify set up and you want to use passwordless authentication. You would like a highly secure backup method in case you experience issues with your primary device.

These instructions are for anyone who can't reliably use a smartphone or landline to authenticate two-step verification. Instead, you can use a hardware token, a small device that plugs into your computer to complete two-factor verification with the touch of a button. Tokens do not work with mobile devices—they can only be used to authenticate when signing in on a computer with either a USB-A or USB-C ports commonly found on desktop or laptop computers. Request a hardware token Each hardware token is exclusive to a user and can't be assigned to more than one HarvardKey account. To request a token, submit a ticket with the subject line ""Request a hardware token."" They may also be available for pickup at your local IT support desk. Two-step verification must already be activated on your HarvardKey account with another device for a token to be added. If you haven't done so yet, follow these instructions to activate two-step verification. Authenticate to HarvardKey with a hardware token Once you receive your token, insert it into an open USB port on your computer with the metal ""Y"" face up.

Okta is available to all HarvardKey users. Learn more about getting started with Okta. HarvardKey two-step authentication requests are sent by Duo push notification to your mobile device, or by text message or phone call when you attempt to log in to a university resource using HarvardKey. Never approve a Duo authentication request if you are not actively attempting to log into a university resource.

Administrative Systems,GMAS FAQ:  I'm new to Harvard. Why can't I access GMAS?,"QUESTION: I'm new to Harvard. Why can't I access GMAS? ANSWER: In order to access GMAS, you must first be given security. Security can be given in a few different ways. 1.You are added to a project as a PI/Mentor, or as an interfaculty involvement PI or interfaculty involvement department administrator. This will allow you to log into GMAS and grant you access to any project where you play the PI or Mentor role. 2.You are added to a segment administrative team. This will allow you to log into GMAS and grant you access to any project where you have been added to an administrative team. The action you can perform on the project will be determined based on the role you were added to on the administrative team. 3.You are added to a standing team. This will allow you to log into GMAS and grant you access to all projects that fit the scope of the standing team you belong to (this could be by ORG, or by ORG and PI). For more information on how security works, and who can help you with security, visit the ""GMAS Security Deconstructed"" job aid. If your profile is not yet showing in GMAS, and this is preventing you from being given GMAS security through any of the methods above, it is likely due to a timing issue. There are a few systems through which a person’s information needs to flow, before it can make its way into GMAS. When an employee first starts, their manager and local HR representative assist the individual to ensure they receive a HUID and are placed on payroll. Part of this process is being set up in the Identity Management system (IDM). Once a person is in the IDM system, their information is sent to PeopleSoft and GMAS. Data flows from IDM, to PeopleSoft, then to GMAS. This means that it will take at least two days from the time an individual is added to IDM to be added to GMAS. If the individual is added to IDM after noon, it can take up to three days for the individual to be added to GMAS. GMAS allows access and person profile selection for ONLY the following roles that do not fit the above definitions: Academic Advisor Consultant Contingent Worker External Administrative Affiliate External Core Customer Field Education Supervisor Hospital Administrator Incoming Employee/Transfer Interschool Affiliate Research Collaborator Security Smithsonian Astrophysics Affiliate Vendor Volunteer"
Administrative Systems,Receiving an error message when trying to sign the Participation Agreement,"There are 2 reasons why an error message will appear when trying to access the Participation Agreement link: (1) an incorrect link was provided (2) there’s an issue related to the individual's start date. 1. An incorrect link was provided: In this case, someone sends a link for the Request or Person Profile page in GMAS (where GMAS users can easily access the Participation Agreement), instead of the link to the Participation Agreement (where non-GMAS users can easily access the Participation Agreement). The GMAS links can only be accessed by individuals who have appropriate security to get into GMAS. Most of the time, the people who need to sign don't have the proper security to access GMAS and therefore receive a security error message. The proper link to sign the Participation Agreement is https://gmas.harvard.edu/gmas/participationagreement. For more information about the Participation Agreement, you can visit the Office of the Vice Provost for Research website. Information about the Harvard University Participation Agreement can be found under the Intellectual Property Policy. The correct link to the Participation Agreement can also be found there. It is not required that an individual have GMAS security to sign the Participation Agreement. Anyone with a HUID should be able to sign using the correct link. 2. There’s an issue related to individual’s start date: If the individual who needs to sign falls into one of the following categories, it would cause an error when trying to link to the Participation Agreement: They have a start date that is three business days or less in the past They have a start date that is in the future They were set-up in advance of their start date with a Person of Interest role which does not feed into GMAS Transfer of person information can take a few days to pass between systems. Usually, a person’s information will make its way into GMAS three business days after their official start date. At this time, they should be able to sign the Participation Agreement. The proper link to the Participation Agreement is https://gmas.harvard.edu/gmas/participationagreement. If an individual needs to sign the Participation Agreement before their start date, they will need to be set up in the Identity Management System (IDM/MIDAS) in a role that GMAS receives. GMAS allows access and person profile selection for ONLY the following roles: Academic Advisor Consultant Contingent Worker External Administrative Affiliate External Core Customer Field Education Supervisor Hospital Administrator Incoming Employee/Transfer Interschool Affiliate Research Collaborator Security Smithsonian Astrophysics Affiliate Vendor Volunteer If you are receiving an error message when trying to sign the Participation Agreement, and none of the issues above apply, please email us at contactgmas@harvard.edu."

Administrative Systems,HART FAQ: Saved Customizations on Transaction LIsting Dashboard Not Working,"QUESTION: HART FAQ: Saved Customizations on Transaction Listing Dashboard Not Working ANSWER: This knowledge article discusses saved customizations not working on the Transaction Listing dashboards in the Harvard Analytics and Reporting Tool (HART) powered by OBI (Oracle Business Intelligence). These are the resources for HART that can be used for the financial dashboards, grant management dashboards, procure-to-pay dashboards, CAPS dashboards, Chart of Accounts dashboards, Cash Management dashboards, User Security Dashboards, Accounts Receivable dashboards and CSMA dashboards. Student dashboards and Student Financial dashboards are NOT covered here-search my.harvard for these dashboards. Migrated Customizations on the Transaction Listing Dashboards DMS has migrated all existing customizations for all dashboards into the upgraded version of HART, which will be implemented on May 20, 2019. An issue has come up concerning the Transaction Listing Dashboards: When the user applies a saved customization on any Transaction Listing dashboard, two things may happen: A % sign will appear in the Consolidated Flag prompt (this will usually happen) A number may appear in the User Role Choice prompt (this is inconsistent) This is only happening on the Transaction Listing dashboards. In addition, this only impacts migrated customizations on these dashboards. New customizations created in the upgraded HART will NOT have this problem. Applying a Migrated Customization to a Transaction Listing Dashboard After accessing your Transaction Listing dashboard, select the Page Options menu under your HUID in the top right corner, then select Apply Saved Customization. A list of saved customizations will appear: 2. Click on the Customization. In this example, the user is seeing both issues: a number appears in the User Role Choice prompt and a % sign appears in the Consolidating Flag prompt: If Only the % Sign Appears If only the % sign in the Consolidating Flag prompt appears, the customization may run without problems. The % sign is the equivalent to the (All Column Values) that usually appears in this prompt. In some cases, the dashboard will not run. If that is the case: Confirm your User Role and select the first Apply button on the dashboard. If that still does not work, Select the second Apply button on the dashboard. Once the dashboard runs, the customization will begin to work normally, and you will not need to do this again. Re-Saving the Customization with Revised Prompts If you wish to make a change to the existing customization with updated prompts, you will need to change the % sign in the Consolidating Flag prompt to (All Column Values), and then re-save the customization with the same name. See steps 3 onward in the next section for instructions on how to re-save a customization. If both the % Sign and the Number in the User Role Choice Prompt Appears If both the % sign in the Consolidating Flag prompt appears and the User Role Choice prompt contains a number, the dashboard will NOT run You will need to fix the issues and re-save the customization. This is a one-time action and after the customization is re-saved, you will not encounter this issue again. To resolve this issue: Review your role in the User Role Choice prompt and confirm it is correct. If it is not, select the correct role from the drop-down. Even if you did not change your role, select the 1st Apply button. The dashboard should run. If the dashboard does not run, hit the 2nd Apply button. Select Page Options, Save Current Customization 4. Give Customization the same name. Click OK. 5. You will receive a dialog box asking you to confirm; click Yes. Once you re-save the customization, it will now work correctly each time you apply it. Reminder: When you apply a customization on a FIN-Core dashboard, you do not have to select any Apply buttons."

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",General Considerations for Recording and Saving Transcripts of Zoom Meetings,"General Considerations for Recording and Saving Transcripts of Zoom Meetings How do Zoom recordings work? Who can record? Does Zoom notify meeting participants about recordings? Where do the recordings go, and who can see them? How do Zoom’s transcript features work? How do I save a transcript/ Who can save a transcript? What is saved in a Zoom meeting transcript? Does Zoom notify meeting participants about transcripts? Where do the transcripts go, and who can see them? Should I record or save a transcript of my Zoom meeting? How do I secure my recording? Specific Use Cases Public events Nonpublic meetings Nonpublic speaking engagements Class sessions Non-Class Meetings Intended for Students Meetings of Faculty and Staff How do Zoom recordings work? Zoom’s push-button recording feature makes it easy to record any meeting hosted on the platform. The information below describes Zoom’s recording functionality as of the date of posting, but note that Zoom continues to introduce new product features. Who can record? The default setting for Harvard users allows only the Zoom meeting host to Zoom-record a meeting session, although the meeting host may authorize other meeting participants to record the meeting. We generally advise that meeting hosts not allow other participants to record a Zoom meeting. Does Zoom notify meeting participants about recordings? When a meeting host activates a Zoom recording, Zoom announces that “this meeting is being recorded.” If the host stops the recording, Zoom will announce that “the recording has stopped.” Any meeting participant who joins a meeting in progress will hear an announcement from Zoom that the meeting is being recorded. At all times when a meeting is being recorded, a button appears at the top left corner of the Zoom window: blinking . Where do the recordings go, and who can see them? When a meeting host activates recording, Zoom presents the host with two options:  and . If the host selects , Zoom creates recording files in multiple formats, including audio-only and a video recording. When the host ends the meeting, Zoom presents these several files to the host, who can then save them locally. If the host selects , Zoom prepares an audio recording, a video recording (showing only speakers), and an accompanying Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated audio transcript of the meeting. These files are available for the host only to access at a unique URL provided by Zoom for that meeting. The host may, in turn, share secondary unique URLs that will present the video recording, audio-only recording, or transcript to others. Note: unless additional steps are taken to secure the recording (see below: “How Do I Secure My Recording?”), any member of the public who accesses that URL can view the shared video recording. (The URLs are very long and would be difficult to guess.) The recording is therefore only private to the extent that the URL is not disclosed. How do Zoom’s transcript features work? How do I save a transcript/ Who can save a transcript? Zoom provides two ways to generate and save a transcript: (1) through its cloud recording function which, when turned on in Zoom’s settings, generates a transcript automatically after the meeting is over; and (2) through the self-service  setting in Zoom’s captioning functions, which allows captions to be generated by a captioning service, by meeting attendees, or automatically by artificial intelligence. If as host you record a Zoom meeting to the cloud, Zoom will provide three links at the URL where your cloud recording is posted: a link to a video recording of the meeting, a link to an audio recording of the meeting, and a link to a time-stamped transcript of the meeting. Only the host can access the URL, although the host may share a secondary URL that will cause the recipient to download the transcript file. (Note: recording to your computer will not generate a transcript.) Zoom also includes a captioning feature that, when switched on, allows meeting attendees to see speech-to-text transcriptions of spoken audio in real time, during the meeting. Zoom’s settings for captioning allow a meeting host to enable all meeting attendees to save transcripts of the captioning, at their option. A meeting host can choose to activate  to enable all of your meetings’ attendees — not just you, the host — to save transcripts of your meeting and do what they like with them. This functionality has important privacy implications, which we discuss below. What is saved in a Zoom meeting transcript? Zoom meetings can be captioned live in a meeting either manually by a person or by artificial intelligence. Human generated captioning requires a person to type what is spoken in real-time. The meeting host may designate another meeting participant to type the captions during a meeting or engage a 3rd party caption service to do this work. Zoom recently introduced a feature that will produce captions during the course of a meeting, using an AI (artificial intelligence) speech-to-text technology that analyzes audio files and generates text transcripts of what was spoken. The Zoom meeting transcript generated alongside the recording saved in the Zoom cloud includes text along with the name of the person speaking. A saved file from Zoom’s live captioning includes transcript text and time stamps, but no speaker names. Although live captioning identifies which meeting attendee said what, the saved transcript of the same meeting does not identify individual speakers. A transcript may nevertheless identify speakers in the rendered text (when speakers introduce themselves) and/or through context (when one speaker addresses a question to a second speaker by name, and the second speaker answers; or when one speaker attributes what was earlier said to another person). Does Zoom notify meeting participants about transcripts? Unlike with recordings, Zoom does not announce to participants that the meeting host will be generating a transcript of what meeting participants are communicating. If a host generates a transcript simply by recording to the cloud, the attendees will know the meeting is recorded but not necessarily that a transcript will be made available, too. If a host enables  via Zoom’s live captioning function, all meeting attendees will be able to see that they can save transcripts of the meeting. Where do the transcripts go, and who can see them? Transcripts made incident to recordings to the cloud are available for viewing at unique URLs provided by Zoom and accessible only to hosts, alongside the corresponding recordings. The host may share a link to the transcript file, but once the file is shared, it can be freely copied and distributed by the recipient. When  is enabled in Zoom live captioning, each individual meeting attendee may choose to save a transcript, and the transcript will be saved to the attendee’s computer. Should I record or save a transcript of my Zoom meeting? Exceptional reasons to record a Zoom meeting include: You intend to post a digital recording of the meeting online for a public or select audience to watch after the fact, or you expect that you will need to repurpose the meeting (for example, by making a live training session to one audience available to other audiences in a recorded format). You would have recorded the meeting anyway in the ordinary course if you were conducting it in person or by telephone. You expect that certain critical invitees will not be able to attend the meeting, and it would be insufficient (e.g., for accessibility reasons) simply to provide them with a slide deck, minutes, notes, or briefing of the meeting after the fact. You find during the meeting that one or more attendees are having Zoom connectivity problems, and it would be insufficient simply to provide them with a slide deck, minutes, notes, or briefing of the meeting after the fact. If none of these considerations applies to your meeting, then we advise as a general matter that you do not Zoom-record your meeting. Similar considerations apply to the generation of saved transcripts: unless you anticipate some need to access personally or communicate to third parties what was discussed in the meeting and it would be insufficient to refer to or provide a slide deck, minutes, notes, or a briefing of meeting, you should not save a transcript of the meeting. This is especially true of the self-service  setting in Zoom’s live captioning feature because each individual user will be able to generate and save transcripts entirely outside your control as host. Because the self-service  setting in live captioning is much less secure, you should not enable it unless you have a compelling reason why recourse to the cloud-recording transcript would not suffice for your purposes. It is strongly recommended that recordings are not substituted for agendas or meeting minutes. See the University’s General Records Schedule for further guidance on how to manage meeting records. How do I secure my recording? Although the shareable URL where a Zoom cloud recording is posted is not publicly listed or easy, necessarily, to guess, it remains the case that any person who gets hold of the URL may be able to watch the video. Accordingly, among other features it has adopted to protect the privacy of meeting participants, Zoom allows meeting hosts to password-protect video recordings of their meetings. If students appear and are personally identifiable in your meeting recording, you must password-protect the video. In fact, we strongly urge members of the Harvard community to apply password protection to all Zoom recordings, if they must make and store them on the Zoom cloud. In addition, you should not make it available for download or otherwise distribute a digital copy of the recording. If your Zoom meeting is a class session, you should post the link to the recording only within Canvas, and nowhere else. Last, you should delete Zoom recordings when you no longer have need of them. If you have exceptional need for longer term access to recordings and transcripts that do not include students, the preferred storage option is to use Harvard-licensed systems such as OneDrive, Sharepoint, DropBox, Panopto, Kaltura, or use shared network drives if absolutely necessary. Transcripts made incident to recordings to the cloud are available for viewing at unique URLs provided by Zoom and accessible only to hosts, alongside the corresponding recordings. The host may share a link to the transcript file, but once the file is shared, it can be freely copied and distributed by the recipient. For information about how to apply password protection and other ways to protect the privacy of persons who attend your Zoom meeting, visit this HUIT Knowledge Base document, which describes several Zoom privacy features. As noted above, the  setting in Zoom’s live captioning feature allows all of a meeting’s attendees to generate and save their own transcripts. If you activate this setting, you will not be able to secure any of the transcripts that the other attendees make and keep for themselves (and may easily distribute to others). Specific Use Cases Public events For these purposes, a “Public Event” is an event directed to a live public audience. If you intend to use Zoom to record a Public Event for any reason — for internal use, to post on a public-facing website, or anything in between, you should do the following: First, you must ensure that invited speakers, panelists, or presenters sign an appropriate speaker release form. You can find variations of this form for paid and unpaid engagements on the OGC website. Please contact Records Management Services for guidance on how to manage release forms and the University General Records Schedule for how to manage the recording and any transcripts over the long term. Second, as a best practice, you should take steps to allow audience members to access a live stream of the event without simultaneously projecting audio or video into the Zoom meeting. Zoom Webinars follows this model and includes features that support moderated Q&A sessions with audience members. You can also live stream a Zoom meeting through YouTube; audience members watch the event on YouTube and can comment and ask questions using YouTube’s live chat feature. Moderators can then monitor the chat and select questions to put to speakers in the Zoom session. In addition to reducing the risk of “Zoom-bombing” and other disruptions (intentional or unintentional) of your event, these methods eliminate the privacy considerations that arise from audience members appearing and speaking in the recorded session. Nonpublic meetings Different recording and privacy considerations apply to Zoom sessions not directed to a live public audience, depending on the nature and purpose of the session and the composition of the audience. We break out nonpublic Zoom sessions into categories below, but we first refer you to the considerations expressed above (“Should I Record My Zoom Meeting?”) to inform your decision whether or not to record. Nonpublic speaking engagements If you are hosting a lecture, panel discussion, seminar, or similar program in which speakers present to a select (i.e., nonpublic) audience of invitees, other than a class session (discussed below), we suggest that you follow the practices we recommend above for “Public Events,” which would keep audience members from appearing and speaking in the Zoom meeting. If, however, your program calls for direct interaction between speakers and members of the audience, you should do the following: First, you must ensure that invited speakers, panelists, or presenters sign an appropriate speaker release form. You can find variations of this form for paid and unpaid engagements on the OGC website. Please contact Records Management Services for guidance on how to manage release forms and the University General Records Schedule for how to manage the recording and any transcripts over the long term. Second, you should tell the audience: That you are recording the event and if you are recording to the cloud, saving a written transcript. How you plan to use the recording and/or transcript, including who will be able to see or hear them. That they have no obligation to appear or speak in the recording. That they can turn off video and participate under an alias if they choose. That if they choose to participate in an identifiable way, they are authorizing the use of the recording (and, if applicable, the transcript) as you have described it. Class sessions Recordings for Class Use Only. If your objective in recording a class session is simply to make an archived recording available to people who need it for the class—enrolled students and instructors and their supporting personnel—it is sufficient simply to provide notice (1) that you are recording the class and (2) for what purpose. If you want the same group of people to be able to review a written transcript of the session, you should record the class session to the cloud. This approach to generating transcripts is much more secure than switching on the self-service transcript generation setting in Zoom live captioning. When you make a class recording available using Zoom, you should use the cloud recording option and take steps to secure the recording as described above (“How Do I Secure My Recording?”). Recordings saved to the Zoom cloud include a transcript which when shared through a secured recording URL can be password protected. Note, sharing a link directly to the transcript does not have the option for password protection. Recording for Broader Audiences. If you have Zoom-recorded a class session for student access, and you subsequently have reason to make a class session recording more broadly available—i.e., to persons outside of the class—then student privacy considerations require, as a legal matter, that any students who appear and are personally identifiable in the video must provide written consent to that disclosure. This holds true as well in the case of saved written transcripts of the class if students are named in the transcript or are identifiable from context. The written consent should consist of a description of the disclosures you will make outside the class, including to whom, by what means, and for what purpose. It is sufficient if students simply respond “yes” to an email that includes these details and asks if they will consent to the disclosure. If prior to hosting a class session you anticipate that you will need to make a recording or transcript of some or all of the class available outside of the class, you should notify the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning. If you are unable to obtain the needed consent for disclosure of your recorded video or transcript outside of your class, and you need help removing appearances by personally identifiable students from the recording or transcript, you should contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning for technical assistance. If you have questions about the federal privacy law governing student records, you should contact the Office of the General Counsel. Non-Class Meetings Intended for Students This category includes Zoom meetings specifically directed at student audiences. Examples are Career Services Q&A sessions, office hours hosted by faculty, and meetings or other information sessions with faculty and administrators that would have been conducted in person or by phone, prior to the COVID-19 crisis. Generally speaking, we advise that you not record Zoom meetings for these purposes, unless one of the considerations that favor recording applies, as described above (“Should I Record My Zoom Meeting?”). If you do record the meeting, you must do the following: If the meeting is directed to a small number of students, you must: Tell the students that you are recording the event and, if you are recording to the cloud, saving a written transcript, and ask whether they consent to the recording. Unless all participating students consent to the recording, you should not record the Zoom session. Obtain written consent of all student participants in the meeting before disclosing the recording or transcript to any person who is not a Harvard employee with a legitimate educational interest in accessing the recording. If the meeting is directed to a large number of students—for example, a Career Services Q&A or a department-wide meeting—it may not be practical to elicit express written consent to subsequent use of the recording from all participating students. In that case, you must tell the students: That you are recording the event and/or, if applicable, saving a written transcript. How you plan to use the recording or transcript, including who will be able to see or hear them. That students have no obligation to appear or speak in the recording. That students can turn off video and participate under an alias if they choose. That if students choose to participate in an identifiable way, they are consenting to the disclosure of the recording or transcript as you have described it. Even if you take all of the above precautions, there may be cases in which it is nevertheless inappropriate or unlawful to disclose the video recording or transcript to third parties. Accordingly, if any student appears and is personally identifiable in your Zoom recording, you should contact the Office of the General Counsel before disclosing the recording to any person who is not a Harvard employee with a legitimate educational interest in accessing the recording. When you make a meeting recording available using Zoom, you should use the cloud recording option and take steps to secure the recording as described above (“How Do I Secure My Recording?”). Recordings saved to the Zoom cloud include a transcript which when shared through a secured recording URL can be password protected. Note, sharing a link directly to the transcript does not have the option for password protection. Meetings of Faculty and Staff Faculty meetings should not be recorded, nor should you use Zoom to save a written transcript or enable Zoom’s self-service  setting. In the case of staff meetings, we advise that you not record Zoom staff meetings or enable self-service  unless one of the considerations that favor recording applies, as described above (“Should I Record My Zoom Meeting?”). If you decide to record a staff meeting, the resulting recording or transcript should not be made available to anyone who was not invited to the meeting. If you feel you need to show the recording or transcript to any person who was not invited to the meeting, you should first consult with your local HR dean or director. It is strongly recommended that recordings are not substituted for agendas or meeting minutes. See the University’s General Records Schedule for further guidance on how to manage meeting records. If you make a meeting recording available using Zoom, you should use the cloud recording option and take steps to secure the recording as described above (“How Do I Secure My Recording?”). Recordings saved to the Zoom cloud include a transcript which when shared through a secured recording URL can be password protected. Note, sharing a link directly to the transcript does not have the option for password protection."

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Manage your OneDrive version history settings,"Harvard OneDrive uses the Automatic Version History setting as a default. The Automatic setting is based on the following algorithm: First 30 days: All versions created within 500 count limit are saved. Between 30 - 60 days: Hourly versions (versions created at the top of the hour) are saved. Between 60 - 180 days: Daily versions (versions created at the beginning of each day) are saved.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",How do I instruct Stakeholders (Guests) whom I do business with to Setup a Kiteworks Guest Account?,"These instructions are for recipients of a Kiteworks secure file transfer who are external to Harvard and need to set up a guest account to access the files sent to them. Harvard stakeholders (guests) who do business with Harvard faculty and staff that have the need to send or receive files securely are able to do so using the Accellion Kiteworks tool. The Harvard stakeholder (guest) is required to setup a Kiteworks Guest Account. This guest account is valid for 30 consecutive days after last use. The 30 day expiration will reset after each use, but will expire automatically if not used within those 30 days. If a guest account expires, a new account can be setup using the same login email address and a new password, if required for future use. Important Notes: If a Harvard stakeholder (guest) has a Harvard Sponsored Role account with Harvard and a valid HarvardKey within a Harvard email domain, they do not need to setup a Kiteworks Guest Account. Individuals with a Harvard Sponsored Role and a HarvardKey in a Harvard email domain are able to utilize their HarvardKey credentials to sign into Kiteworks and use the tool. To initiate the creation of an account, a Harvard faculty or staff member must first send an email or file transfer to you as the stakeholder (guest) from their Kiteworks account. If you have not received an email from your sponsoring Harvard faculty or staff member, contact them by email or phone to do so. When a stakeholder (guest) receives the email in their email account, they should click the Access Message hyperlink at the bottom of the email message. Following are the steps required for a stakeholder (guest) to setup a guest account with the Kiteworks tool. Please note that it is highly recommended to use a private, browser with a single session (incognito session) while using the Kiteworks tool, particularly if you are using a shared machine or kiosk. Data is often cached in browser settings which can cause the user to be sent to a prior login screen and cause confusion. Create a guest account 1. Click on Access Message in the email message you received. 2. Type in the email address the secure message was sent to. 3. Create a password that conforms to the password policy shown on the screen. Hit Next when complete 4. When you receive the One more step notification, follow instructions to check your email. 5. A confirmation email is sent by Kiteworks to your email account. Login into your email account, open the email, and click on the blue “Activate Account” tab. Sign into your guest account to open a secure file transfer It is highly recommended to use a private browser window, or an incognito browser session as data is often cached within browsers and can cause the user to be presented with prior login menus which can cause confusion. Browse to https://filetransfer.harvard.edu Enter the email address of the new Guest Account and hit “Continue”. This will redirect you to the Kiteworks login screen. Type in the email account and password for the guest login account and click “Sign in”. Upon successful login, you will be placed into your new Kiteworks Guest Account inbox. Note: Guest accounts are active for 30 days from last use. The 30 day expiration will reset after each use, but will expire automatically if not used within those 30 days.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",How do I Sync Dropbox files to my local devices?,"This article is for users trying to sync their Dropbox files to their local device. How to Sync Dropbox files to a local device Follow these steps on Dropbox's website to install the Dropbox Sync Client. What happens if my hard drive doesn't have enough space to sync all of my files? When you save a file to Dropbox, it syncs with all of the devices you've connected with your Dropbox account. This means that it takes up space on each computer hard drive. This can create problems if your hard drive doesn't have enough available space to sync everything in your Dropbox folder. Harvard Dropbox users have two ways to help manage what files sync to your desktop application. We recommend the use of these features to prevent using up too much disk space on local devices or even reaching the storage limit on local drives. Selective sync. Selective sync helps you choose which files appear in your file explorer, and which are only available in the cloud at dropbox.com. Click here to get started with Selective sync. Smart Sync. Smart Sync shows you all of your content in your file explorer, but only downloads the ones that you want to access locally. Click here to get started with Smart Sync. You can use both features together or choose just one."

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Information for new SharePoint owners and administrators,"These instructions are for faculty, students, and staff that have created and are owners of a SharePoint site. Welcome to SharePoint! You recently created a new SharePoint site. SharePoint is a robust platform that fosters communication and collaboration, internally and externally. As a Site Owner, you are also the Site Administrator and are responsible for the following actions: Creating and maintaining user permissions Sharing your Files and Folders Ensuring there are always at least 2 Site owners Customizing your Site pages Create and Maintain User Permissions There are three ways to grant permissions to your new SharePoint site: You can add members to the associated Office 365 Group and they will have access to all content on your SharePoint site including the associated Email & Calendar, Microsoft Planner, and Microsoft Team. The easiest way to manage SharePoint site permissions is to allow all members to access all shared information. If you your SharePoint site requires granular permissions (i.e. restricted folders), you may grant permissions through SharePoint groups. If you need to allow access to a target group, you can grant access to a dynamic Grouper group. For more information regarding requesting and setting Grouper dynamic groups on SharePoint sites, visit the following knowledge base article: Grant SharePoint access to a dynamic group. Add users to the Office 365 Group Open SharePoint Site. In upper right corner, click on Members. Select Add members. Type the name or email address for the member you wish to add. Click Save. Permissions through SharePoint Groups It is important to understand how to apply SharePoint permissions properly so that sensitive information is not exposed to unintended people. To learn about managing permissions for your SharePoint Site through SharePoint Groups, please visit the Microsoft article on SharePoint Site Permissions or take the HUIT training Microsoft 365: Managing SharePoint. Share your Files or Folders Giving someone membership permissions to a site typically gives them access to all files and folders on that site. You can also share individual files or folders with people who do not need full site access. When you share files and folders, you can decide whether to let people edit or just view them. Please review the Microsoft article Share SharePoint files or folders for more information. Ensuring there are always at least two site owners It is important to make sure that there are always at least two owners for your SharePoint Site. Use the following instructions to promote a member of your site to an owner. For Team Sites: In the upper right corner, click on the # members When the pane opens on the right side, listing all members of the group, locate the member you would like to make an owner. Click on the down arrow under the name of the member. Select Owner from the list. For Communication Sites: In the upper right corner, click on the Site Access button. When the page opens on the right side, listing the three main permission groups, search for a member you would like to make an owner in the text box. Click on the down arrow under the name of the member. Select Full Control from the list. Customize your Home Page When you view your site for the first time, you will find that the Home page of a Modern SharePoint site is made up of several web parts. Web parts are the building blocks of a SharePoint page. A web part is used to store particular content or information. The web parts that are included in a new SharePoint site are Documents, Activity, and Comments. You may want to customize what web parts are included on your SharePoint pages. To add a webpart To learn how to add a new web part to your SharePoint page, visit the Microsoft article Using web parts on SharePoint pages. To edit the web parts on a SharePoint Page In the upper right corner of the page, click on Edit. The page will display the different webparts with edit options. Clicking on the webpart allows you to change the details of the webpart like the name, view and size. Allows you to move the webpart to another part of the page. Allows you to duplicate the webpart. Allows you to delete the webpart. Additional Resources: Visit the Microsoft article for more information about managing your SharePoint site.

Step 4: Run the event Follow your run-of-show and be ready with your contingency plans. Have team members join early for a final test of sound and video: If you’ve enabled a practice webinar session, start the webinar when the team is ready. If necessary, adjust Zoom settings or roles and start recording according to the run-of-show. Follow the run-of-show: Be prepared to pivot to your contingency plan if something unexpected happens. Step 5: Follow up after the event If you saved to the Cloud, download your event recording. Download recording: Move cloud recordings to appropriate storage. Save Q&A and chat, as well.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Host a Hybrid Meeting Using Zoom,"Hybrid meetings—meetings with some attendees physically in a room and others joining virtually—are becoming more prevalent at Harvard. These tips can help you set up your hybrid meeting, use technology effectively, and ensure both in-person and remote attendees feel engaged. Please note the information included in this checklist is general guidance and is focused on Zoom as the default video conferencing tool. Check with your School or Unit for local departmental processes and best practices. If you’re looking to host a large meeting or event, consider whether Zoom’s webinar format may better suit your needs. Set up your meeting Schedule meeting times to enable breaks. Consider scheduling 20- or 50-minute meetings to leave time at the end for participants to take a break or get to their next meeting. Familiarize yourself with the conference room technology in advance. Find out if your room includes audio-visual technology and contact the HUIT Service Desk or your local IT support if you need help learning how to use the system. If you are using a CADM conference room with a Cisco video conferencing touch panel, find instructions on how to join a meeting here. Include all participation options in your meeting invitation. Ensure the invitation includes both the virtual meeting link and the physical conference room location, and ask in-person attendees to bring their laptops. Host an accessible meeting. Ensure all attendees, including people with disabilities, can participate and engage with content. Invite your attendees to request virtual and/or physical accessibility accommodations if required. Manage your meeting Start the meeting from your computer, not the conference room technology. If you’re the host, starting the meeting from your computer ensures you can use the full range of host controls during the meeting. You can then join as a participant from the conference room to use the audio-visual technology. If your room has a Cisco video conferencing touch panel, find out how to join as a participant here. Ask in-person attendees to use their laptops to join the virtual meeting too. This helps remote attendees see everyone in the conference room and feel more included, as well as helping in-person attendees see presentations more easily and use the collaboration features, including chat. Manage the meeting audio. If you’re using the conference room audio technology, ask in-person attendees to not connect to the Zoom audio to avoid feedback issues: If joining the meeting from a link: Click the arrow next to the Mute button, then select Leave Computer Audio. If joining from the Zoom desktop app using a meeting ID number: Check the Don’t connect to audio box. Take notes on a collaborative document. Post a link to a shared Word or Google Docs document in the chat, so everyone can see notes immediately and add comments or questions. This will also make it easier to share the notes after the meeting. Host an inclusive meeting Use technology to encourage participation. Use meeting reactions and encourage participation in the chat. Consider using Zoom’s whiteboard feature or annotations on a shared screen. And if you need to poll the group, use Zoom’s polling feature or Poll Everywhere to collect everyone’s input. Engage all attendees. Call on both remote and in-person attendees so everyone has an opportunity to speak. Monitor reactions and activity in the chat window or assign a co-facilitator to help you. Use breakout groups thoughtfully. Combine remote and in-person attendees in breakout groups. Integrating remote attendees across breakout rooms ensures that they feel included and valued. Show remote attendees what’s happening in the room. If you need to use physical tools, like the in-room whiteboard, post-it notes, or a flip chart, point a webcam at it so remote attendees can see. Use descriptive language instead of saying “here” or “this” when demonstrating something. Need Help? Chat: Log in to chat live with a HUIT technician Submit a ticket Call: (617) 495-7777"

If you are a user of the HBS instance of Zoom, contact HBS IT. If you are a user of the HIPAA instance of Zoom, contact HUHS IT. Enhanced Encryption Zoom meetings and webinars by default use 256-bit AES GCM encryption for audio, video, and application sharing (i.e., screen sharing, whiteboarding) in transit between Zoom applications, clients, and connectors. No further action is required for enabling this protection. You can verify this setting either when scheduling a meeting or during the meeting after it’s started.

During a meeting/webinar: On the top-left of your Zoom window, you will see an icon of a green shield with a checkmark on it. Clicking the icon will bring up a window that confirms your encryption status. End to End Encryption (E2EE) E2EE is best for when you want enhanced privacy and data protection for your meetings and is an extra layer to mitigate risk and protect sensitive meeting content. E2EE is not required for meetings containing level 4 data. E2EE can be enabled for individually scheduled, PMI, and instant meetings. It can also be defaulted to on for all meetings (not recommended). Enabling E2EE for meetings requires all meeting participants to join from the Zoom desktop client, mobile app, or Zoom Rooms. Users will not be able to join by telephone, SIP/H.323 devices, on-premise configurations, the Zoom web client, third-party clients leveraging the Zoom Web SDK, or Lync/Skype clients, as these endpoints cannot be encrypted end to end. E2EE meetings are limited to 1,000 participants. Enabling this setting also disables the following features: Join before host Cloud recording Live streaming Live transcription Breakout Rooms Polling Zoom Apps Zoom Whiteboard Meeting reactions 1:1 private chats E2EE can be enabled on a per-meeting basis or set as a default for all meetings. When scheduling a meeting: Click End-to-end Encryption in the Encryption field. You will see a warning about which features will be disabled as a result.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",View sample Zoom settings for virtual events,"This guidance is for Harvard Zoom account holders planning a virtual event. Zoom provides many ways to customize your meeting or webinar experience. Below we’ve listed three example events and how to configure settings to support the events. We encourage you to make your own modifications depending on the needs of your events. Example 1: Panel discussion with Q&A (webinar) Example 2: Non-interactive lecture (webinar) Example 3: Interactive, all-hands meeting (meeting) For any Zoom meeting or webinar, we recommend you also refer to these resources before conducting your event: Tips for making your meeting secure Rules and best practices for recording Hosting accessible remote meetings and events Example 1: Panel discussion with Q&A (webinar) A moderator facilitates a discussion among 3 panelists with limited audience engagement through a Q&A session at the end. No registration is required. Panelists: 3 speakers with slides, including a moderator (upgraded to Co-host) to facilitate discussion. Panelists are responsible for muting and unmuting themselves. Host: Manages webinar logistics, attendee view, and troubleshooting Alternative host: Monitors attendee Q&A and joins discussion to share questions with panelists Settings: At time of scheduling Video Host: Off Panelists: Off Audio Telephone and Computer Audio: (on/select) Webinar Options Q&A (on/select): allows attendees to ask (written) questions during the webinar Enable Practice Session (on/select): Allows host, alternative host, and panelists to join the webinar before attendees. Host starts the broadcast. Alternative Hosts Designate an alternative host. Alternative hosts will default to co-hosts if the host has already started the meeting. Q&A Allow anonymous questions: Off/deselect Allow attendees to view answered questions only (on/select): Allows host, alternative host, and panelists some discretion in which questions are answered live. Settings: In practice session Participants panel, under More Allow Participants to Unmute Themselves (on/select): In webinars, attendees are never able to unmute themselves, but with this setting on, panelists and co-hosts are. Play Sound When Someone Joins/Leaves (off/deselect): For large events, this sound becomes disruptive. Allow Participants to Rename Themselves (on/select): Co-hosts can rename themselves so that their role in the meeting is clear (e.g., change to a department name or what their role is—notetaker, moderator, etc.). Allow Panelist to Start Video (on/select): Allows panelist to turn their own video on without host intervention. Allow Attendees to Raise Hand (off/deselect): Monitoring raised hands increases the responsibility of the host and co-hosts. If you leave this on, set expectations with attendees about whether this will be used for questions. Attendee Video Layout – Follow Host’s View (on/select): Allows more precise control of attendee’s view through the view of the host. Please note that this selection doesn’t impact the view that a panelist sees. Chat panel, under ellipsis Allow attendees to chat with—No one: Like raised hands, monitoring chat increases the responsibility of the host and co-hosts and may distract panelists, so it’s recommended that you make this feature inaccessible to attendees. Host, co-hosts, and panelists can still chat with each other, although it’s recommended that you set up a group text for in-webinar communication. Advanced Sharing Options Who can share? -- All Panelists: Allows panelists to manage their own slides. Who can start sharing when someone else is sharing? -- All Panelists: Allows for smoother transitions between panelists’ sharing of slides. Example 2: Non-interactive lecture (webinar) A single speaker making a presentation with no audience participation. No registration required. Host: Manages webinar logistics, attendee view, and troubleshooting Alternative host: Speaker with slides who can also start the webinar if the host is not present. Settings: At time of scheduling Video Host: Off Panelists: Off Audio Telephone and Computer Audio (on/select) Webinar Options Q&A: Off/deselect Enable Practice Session (on/select): Allows host and alternative host to join the webinar before attendees Automatically record webinar (on/select): Eliminate the risk of forgetting to start the recording during the practice session. Please consult these rules and best practices for recording before making this selection. Alternative Hosts Designate an alternative host. Alternative hosts will default to co-hosts if the host has already started the meeting. Q&A Allow anonymous questions: Off/deselect Allow attendees to view answered questions only (on/select): Allows host, alternative host, and panelists some discretion in which questions are answered live.

Allow Panelist to Start Video (on/select): Allow Attendees to Raise Hand (off/deselect): Monitoring raised hands increases the responsibility of the host and co-hosts, so it’s recommended that this feature be turned off. Attendee Video Layout – Active Speaker View (on/select): Since there will be just one speaker (assuming the host mutes their microphone), this selection forces the attendee view to be on the active speaker. Please note that this selection doesn’t impact the view that a host or co-host sees. Chat panel, under ellipsis Allow attendees to chat with—No one: Like raised hands, monitoring chat increases the responsibility of the host and co-hosts and may distract panelists, so it’s recommended that you make this feature inaccessible to attendees. Host, co-hosts, and panelists can still chat with each other, although it’s recommended that you set up a group text for in-webinar communication. Advanced Sharing Options Who can share? -- All Panelists (on/select): Allows panelists to manage their own slides. Who can start sharing when someone else is sharing? -- Only Host (on/select): The host maintains control of sharing. Example 3: Interactive, all-hands meeting (meeting) A departmental meeting with a primary speaker with opportunity for participants to engage. Host: Manages meeting logistics, manages participants, shares questions with presenters, and troubleshooting Alternate host: Moderates the discussion; presents slides; can start meeting if host is not present. Participants: 250 participants who can ask/answer questions Settings: At time of scheduling Security Waiting Room (on/select): Allows the host and alternate hosts to join the meeting before participants. Video Host: Off/deselect Panelists: Off/deselect Audio Telephone and Computer Audio: (on/select) Meeting Options Enable join before host (off/deselect): Even if this option is selected, the Waiting Room feature makes it impossible to join before the host. Mute participants upon entry (on/select): Reduces disruption by participants who are not active in the discussion. Alternative Hosts Designate an alternative host according to the example guidance. Alternative hosts will default to co-hosts if the host has already started the meeting. Settings: In meeting Participants panel, under More Allow Participants to Unmute Themselves (on/select): Increases responsibility of host to manage participants, but allows participants to participate in the conversation. Set ground rules ahead of meeting for how to be recognized for your turn to speak (raise hand). Play Sound When Someone Joins/Leaves (off/deselect): Minimizes disruption when participants are allowed into the meeting from the waiting room. Chat panel, under ellipsis Allow attendees to chat with—Host only: Forces discourse to happen in meeting rather than chat, while still giving participants the opportunity to communicate with the host. Advanced Sharing Options Who can share? -- Only Host (on/select): Prevents participants from sharing their screen and reduces impact of potential Zoom bombers. Who can start sharing when someone else is sharing? -- Only Host (on/select): Keeps control of sharing with the host. Need help?

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Harvard Dropbox for Existing Dropbox Teams,"Harvard Dropbox for Existing Teams This article explains the two scenarios for individuals with pre-existing Dropbox Teams that may or may not be migrating into Harvard Dropbox. My Team will be migrating.  Some Harvard personnel already have Dropbox Business accounts that predate Harvard Dropbox or are sponsored by other organizations. If this is the case and you want to use Harvard Dropbox, begin by finding out whether your team will be migrating.  If they are, here’s what you can expect: Your Authorized Requestor, along with your current team administrator, will determine whether your Dropbox Business Team will migrate to Harvard Dropbox as a group. If your team is approved, you and the other members will find your team intact in the Harvard Dropbox environment, when the migration is complete. As a team member in another Dropbox account, respond to instructions you receive in emails from Dropbox or from your Team Administrator.  The migration process should automatically trigger any device that currently syncs with your consumer Dropbox account to also sync with your Harvard University Dropbox account. Dropbox may prompt you to enter your Dropbox credentials on your devices, in order to begin syncing. Click on this link for an overview of syncing.  Note: If your current Dropbox login does not use your HarvardKey primary email address, you will have to change your login to use it before your Team can be migrated. Your Team Administrator should notify you and provide instructions if this is the case.  Click this link for instructions on changing your Dropbox login. My Team will not be migrating. If your team is not migrating, here’s what you can expect: Your Authorized Requestor, along with your current team administrator, will determine whether your Dropbox Business Team will migrate to Harvard Dropbox as a group. You may still be eligible for Harvard Dropbox as an individual, even if your Team is not approved for migration.  Here are the steps you will follow to obtain a Harvard Dropbox account: When Dropbox is informed of Harvard’s decision not to migrate the Team, Dropbox will email you and any other eligible team members from Harvard with an invitation to downgrade your account to a free private consumer account. This is only a transitional step; no data will be lost. Once you have downgraded your account, you will receive an invitation to upgrade it to a Harvard Dropbox account. The invitation will contain instructions for logging in to your account for the first time. With your Harvard Dropbox account, you will be able to collaborate with your old Dropbox team using shared documents and folders (unless your Team and its administrator have decided to discontinue the Team account).

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Manage OneDrive Storage,"OneDrive is an essential tool for faculty, staff, and students, enabling seamless collaboration and cloud-based file storage. However, storage space can quickly fill up with large or unnecessary files, leading to increased storage. To prepare for Microsoft's storage caps, maintain optimal performance, and ensure compliance with institutional policies, it’s crucial to actively manage OneDrive storage. This guide outlines best practices for keeping your storage usage below the storage caps while aligning with Harvard’s record-keeping requirements. Step 1: Review the General Records Schedule Before deleting or moving files, consult Harvard's General Records Schedule (GRS) and any specific departmental guidelines. This ensures compliance with data retention policies that dictate which documents must be preserved for legal, academic, or administrative purposes. At Harvard, certain records must be retained for a specified period, while others can be safely discarded. Be sure to check whether your school or department has any additional records retention policy when making storage decisions. Step 2: Identify and Manage Large Files OneDrive allows you to check file sizes easily, making it simple to identify large items taking up space. How to Check File Sizes in OneDrive: Review the Manage OneDrive Large File Storage article. Once large files have been identified, take action based on their importance and relevance: Options for Managing Large Files Download and Archive: If you need to keep a file but don’t require frequent access, download and store it on an external drive or departmental repository. Move to a Departmental Shared Repository: Files that are relevant to your team or institution should be transferred to departmental SharePoint sites or other shared file repository (Google, Dropbox) to free up individual OneDrive space. Delete Unnecessary Files: Remove outdated or redundant documents, such as old meeting recordings, outdated presentations, and superseded drafts Step 3: Eliminate Drafts and Outdated Versions Many users accumulate unnecessary drafts, multiple file versions, or duplicate content. Regularly review files and delete outdated or redundant versions. Tips for Draft and Version Management: Move final versions of important documents to shared repositories before clearing unnecessary drafts. If collaborative work requires multiple versions, use document comments and track changes instead of creating separate files. Review Version History settings and minimize the number of versions saved. We recommend using the Automatic version history setting. It can save up to 94% of total storage for a file over time. Step 4: Revisit Your OneDrive Files Regularly Establish a habit of reviewing your OneDrive files every week, month, or semester to prevent unnecessary storage buildup. Ongoing Maintenance Checklist: ✅ Check file sizes and remove large or obsolete files. ✅ Organize folders for clarity and easy navigation. ✅ Archive or move long-term files to departmental repositories. ✅ Delete drafts and duplicates to maintain an efficient workspace. By following these best practices, faculty, staff, and students can optimize their OneDrive storage, ensuring compliance with institutional policies while maintaining efficient access to important files.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",What happens when I leave my school or department for employment at another Harvard School?,"If you move to another area of the university your HarvardKey email will most likely change, and your existing Dropbox account will no longer be accessible. In addition, the new school or Harvard entity to which you are employed will both need to be a participating school in this program and agree to fund your Dropbox account for Harvard business use. We recommend discussing your departure and what to do with your Dropbox account before you leave that business unit. The Authorized Requestor from your school should submit a Service Now ticket to the HUIT Service Desk to either delete the Dropbox account or suspend the account upon your departure. When you have claimed your new HarvardKey email address in your new school/department, a new Service Now ticket should be submitted by the new school’s Authorized Requestor, to either have a new Dropbox account created, or reinstate the old account under the new HarvardKey. If you move to another area of the university and your HarvardKey email does not change (remains the same), then your Dropbox account will still be accessible to you, however, your new school or department will need to approve the funding and use of the Dropbox account for Harvard business use. Again, the recommendation is to work through your departure with your existing school or department, and have the Authorized Requestor submit a Service Now ticket to the HUIT Service Desk to delete or suspend the Dropbox account, upon your departure. When you arrive at your new school/department, you can have the new Authorized Requestor submit a ticket to the HUIT Service Desk to either create a new Dropbox account or re-instate the old account. Please note that Harvard Medical School (HMS) is currently not part of the HUIT Harvard Dropbox service. Additional information and steps may be required if you are moving to HMS.

With a dynamic group, you don’t have to manually add and maintain a very large population of users. Access privileges automatically change as a person's role changes. Examples of straightforward, affiliate-based groups: All faculty in a school, division or department All staff and contingent workers in a department or division All students and faculty in a school All employees across Harvard Manage access using a dynamic group The process for managing access with a dynamic group depends on whether you have a Team site or a stand-alone SharePoint site: If you manage a SharePoint site, follow these instructions to grant site, folder, or file access to a dynamic group. Note that adding dynamic group access to a stand-alone SharePoint site does not affect existing individual access permissions granted manually using Microsoft 365. If you manage a Team, submit a request to HUIT to manage access using a dynamic group. Adding dynamic group access to a Team will override existing access permissions granted manually using Microsoft 365. Once a dynamic group is being used in a Team, any additional users must be added directly into Grouper. When providing access to a small number of unaffiliated individuals, manage access manually using Microsoft 365. Using a dynamic group is not recommended for smaller groups of individuals without a common affiliation. In these situations, we recommend that you manually add users to your SharePoint site or Team. Examples of groups of unaffiliated individuals: CIOs across the University Project team with 10 members, across various teams Manage access manually using Microsoft 365 You can manually grant access to SharePoint sites, Teams, folders, and files many ways.

"Chat, Video & Collaboration",Searching In Sharepoint: Best Practices,"Sometimes Sharepoint searches return materials that are not relevant to your search. There are a couple of things that can be done, both as a Sharepoint user and a Sharepoint site owner, that can yield faster and more accurate results. For Sharepoint users: You can use Boolean logic in your searches to specify what exactly you are looking for: AND: searches the content for both keyword 1 and keyword 2 OR: searches content for either keyword 1 or keyword 2 NOT: searches content that contains keyword 1 but does not contain keyword 2. Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) need to be typed in CAPITAL letters and can be used in any search box in Sharepoint. Keywords (words connected by operators) can be a file name, folder name, metadata, or text inside of a document. For Sharepoint site owners: Site indexing runs on a schedule, so there is a possibility that newer material on the site may not yet be indexed. You can reindex your site by going to the Gear icon > Site Information > All Site Settings > Search and Offline Availability > Reindex Site. There are a number of options available in the search settings located in All Site Settings. Usually the default settings are fine, but they can be fine-tuned by site owners. More information can be found at the Microsoft article Specify search settings for a site collection or a site. Always check your site, folder, and file permissions. If a person searching for something they don't have access to, it will not appear in their search results.

HBS users should log in at https://hbs.zoom.us Harvard HIPAA Zoom users should log in at https://harvardhipaa.zoom.us  This Knowledge Article is how to enable Group HD Video - Standard HD (720P) within your Zoom Account. HD video is available only in meetings where there is a host and one other person. The primary use case for enabling HD in Zoom is to create a high-resolution recording of yourself alone or with one other person.

Screen sharing will always display at the native resolution of your monitor regardless of an HD setting enabled. Full high definition video, 1080p is not available currently. Selecting this option will not increase your video resolution. Enabling HD uses higher bandwidth. If you are experiencing issues with delay or lag in your meetings, turn off your HD setting. Recordings in HD also create larger file sizes. In most contexts it is not necessary to record in HD. When making a recording in HD do not store in the Zoom cloud. Store in an alternate location like OneDrive, Google or locally on your computer's hard drive. Note: Even with the HD Video setting enabled, your device must meet Zoom bandwidth requirements.

Computers & Software,Your New FAS Refresh Computer,"These instructions are for FAS faculty and staff with a FAS refresh-funded computer. Your new FAS Desktop computer will provide you with effective, worry-free computing. Since your new computer is part of the FAS Computer Refresh Program, however, there are a few things you should be aware of. FAS Refresh Program computers are purchased. Once the four-year refresh cycle has ended, the computer and all components that came with it must be returned to program in good condition. Please follow these basic guidelines for the proper care of your computer: Any lost components may be billed back to your department. Your computer is tagged with a small label that helps identify the unit as a FAS Computer Refresh Program asset. This sticker must remain on the computer. The tag identifies the four-year anniversary of its deployment and when it will be refreshed. The format of the tag is FYyyQn where (yy) is the Harvard fiscal year (July 1 – June 31) and (n) is the quarter. Example, FY27Q2 is October through December 2027. Do not deface the computer in any way (stickers, permanent markings, etc.). Do not eat or drink near your computer. Liquids and crumbs are one of the leading causes of computer failure. Do not install non-work-related software on the computer. Do not uninstall any of the applications that came with your computer. These are needed to help keep your computer functioning properly. Viruses - be careful which web sites you visit and do not open email attachments from people you do not know as many viruses are caught via these methods. FAS Computers Come with Powerful Security Features Hard Disk Encryption: Encryption on all laptop hard drives is now required to protect personal information. Encrypting the hard drive secures your data in case the laptop is lost or stolen.

Computers & Software,Security Tools and Processes for Managed Windows and Apple Computers,"NOTE: There is a user focused KB that is placed on the desktop of all provisioned Windows computers KB0011452 and KB0020049 for all provisioned Apple Computers. System Requirements Windows 10/11 with 8GB+ RAM + 20% free disk space MacOS 11.x, 12.x or 13.x with 8GB+ RAM + 20% free disk space CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor CrowdStrike is our primary AV and Intrusion Detection tool. It is managed by the Information Security & Data Privacy team. KB0018066 Installation The CrowdStrike client is installed during the computer provisioning process. CrowdStrike self-updates as Security releases new versions. On Macs additional Configuration Policies are set to apply to each device giving CrowdStrike full disk access. Installation Remediation There is an SCCM task that looks for systems missing CrowdStrike and installs it. There is a Jamf Smart Group and Policy that looks for systems missing CrowdStrike and installs it. Exclusions Any user requesting an exclusion would need to get approval from HUIT Security. If approved, Security would provide an uninstall token so a tech could perform the uninstall. We would also add the computer to the CrowdStrike Exclusion collection in SCCM or Jamf so it would not get automatically reinstalled. Encryption All Laptops are required to be encrypted. Installation Windows Bitlocker is our approved encryption tool. It is managed by SCCM, which stores the recovery keys. Encryption is initiated during provisioning and there are SCCM policies in place to encrypt computers if they did not go through our provisioning process. Macs FileVault is our approved encryption tool for macOS and is managed by Jamf, which stores the recovery keys. Encryption is initiated during provisioning and Jamf Smart groups detect the encryption status of laptop computers and is used to encrypt devices if they did not go through our provisioning process. Exclusions Any user asking to be excluded from Bitlocker or FileVault encryption is added to the ‘Decrypt Bitlocker’ collection in SCCM or the “FileVault Exclusion” Smart Group. Recovery Windows If a user needs a recovery key, Technicians can get it from the SCCM Web site https://uiswapps1000012.university.harvard.edu/helpdesk or from the SCCM Bitlocker app in the HUIT Toolkit. Macs If a user needs a recovery key, Technicians can get it from the Jamf Web site https://casper01.cadm.harvard.edu:8443 Reporting Every month we run a report to show our Encryption status. Patching Installation Patches are installed using SCCM and Jamf. We have a three-phase testing schedule and a two-phase rollout schedule. 3rd party patches are provided by PatchMyPC which is fully integrated with SCCM and by Jamf and Vendors. Exclusions Any system that needs to be excluded from patching is added to the Patch Exclusion collection in SCCM and Inventory Only mode in Jamf. This is supposed to be a temporary assignment. The collection membership is reviewed on a regular basis. Reporting We have ongoing reports of our patch progress. Operating System Updates Operating Systems (OS) are only supported for a limited amount of time. We deploy new versions of the OS once a year. Some of these updates are silent installs and others require a period of activity that will disrupt the user. In those cases we notify the user and provide options for the user to upgrade at a time that is convenient for them. Firewall Installation We use the built in Operating System firewall. This is enabled by SCCM to always be on.

Computers & Software,FileMaker General Information,"FileMaker Overview FileMaker or Claris FileMaker is a complete database development and management system consisting of: FileMaker Pro client software - FileMaker Pro client is licensed software installed on users’ computers which is used to open, modify, or create a FileMaker database. It runs on macOS and Windows computers. FileMaker Go, a slightly limited product, runs on iOS devices. Each department is responsible for purchasing its own client licenses. FileMaker Server- FileMaker Server can refer to either the licensed FileMaker software which runs on a cloud hosted server or local server computer. FileMaker databases - A FileMaker database is the document that the FileMaker client software opens and reads. It is stored on and shared by the FileMaker Server. IT Security requires that database be password-protected. FileMaker databases hosted on cloud servers are backed-up once a day and a minimum of a week’s worth of backups are retained. FileMaker Web Direct - If a FileMaker database is configured to allow it, the database can be accessed with a web browser. Web Direct requires sufficient user licenses for the number of simultaneous connections. Best Practices Know Your Departments FileMaker Administrator: Make sure you know who your department's FileMaker Administrator is. This person has full administrative access to your database(s). Know Your Credentials: Ensure you know your login credentials, including your username and password. Please note that HUIT does not have access to departmental databases and cannot reset login credentials. Keep Updated: Always keep your FileMaker client license current and promptly run updates when requested. Security FileMaker cloud hosted servers with Soliant Consulting Inc. for Harvard schools and departments are locked down to Harvard networks and Harvard VPNs only and have been certified by Harvard Information Security to host up to Harvard Level 3 data. Departments are responsible for knowing their data levels and managing their databases to assure that access is limited to authorized users, and that the data is properly stored and encrypted. Please reference Harvard Information Security data policies. Versions The current version of the FileMaker suite of products is 24. FileMaker cloud servers should be kept at up-to-date FileMaker supported versions and FileMaker client licenses should be up-to-date as well. FileMaker Server 24 FileMaker client 20 or above Older versions of FileMaker Pro clients must be upgraded to be stored on a cloud-based server. Instructions are available for verifying your FileMaker client license version. Questions If you have FileMaker questions or concerns chat with a HUIT technician, submit a ticket, or call (617) 495-7777."

Computers & Software,User Account Management in FileMaker databases,"User Account Management in FileMaker databases Every user of every FileMaker database is required to have individual login usernames and passwords. As with all login accounts, Harvard IT Security prohibits sharing of user accounts. Additionally, the use of Guest accounts or any accounts without passwords is prohibited within FileMaker databases. FileMaker databases hosted by HUIT/Soliant use one of two forms of user account management, based on server and database configuration: FileMaker-Based User Authentication (FM) Usernames and passwords and roles are completely defined within the FileMaker databases. This requires a FileMaker administrator to make every user add/modify/delete to every database file. If your databases use FileMaker-Based User Authentication, follow FM Step 1 through FM Step 5 below. Harvard Key User Authentication (HK) Harvard Key authenticates the user based on Azure AD groups, with roles defined within the FileMaker databases. The FileMaker administrator adds the group names and their roles to each database file. User add/modify/deletes are handled through Active Directory's Azure AD groups, and do not need any additional support from a FileMaker administrator. [Harvard Key User Authentication documentation coming soon] FM Step 1: Open the FileMaker database using a FileMaker user account with Admin privileges. FM Step 2: Open the Manage Security window in the FileMaker database. FM Step 3: The Manage Security window. This window shows the list of active user accounts for the FileMaker database. Press the [+New] button to add a user. The newly created user's account name is ""New Account"". In the right pane under Account Name, replace New Account with the user's account name. Use whichever name format works best for your group. Some examples might be ""bob"", ""bobsmith"", ""bqs338"", ""bob_smith@harvard.edu"" etc Now, click on the pencil icon next to the Password area in the right pane. Here, enter a new password twice (for confirmation), then press Set Password. And now, select the level of privilege the user will have in the database. Click on the pencil icon near Privilege Set in the right pane: These pre-defined privs are: [Full Access] User is the administrator of the database. User can not only read and write all data, but can also modify the layouts and database setup itself. Every database file must have at least one user with Full Access. [Data Entry Only] User can read all data in a layout, and can add and modify data as well. User cannot modify any part of the database layout itself. Sometimes used as the Privilege Set for most non-admin users. [Read-Only Access] User can only read the data; the user cannot change or add data, or affect the database layout. Now we see the user bobsmith has a password, the account is active, and the user only has Read-Only access to the data. Repeat this process for each user to be added to the database. FM Step 4: Disable the [Guest] and Admin Accounts After there is at least one user account with [Full Access] privs, the [Guest] and the Admin accounts are disabled for good security. To disable an account, uncheck the ✅ checkbox next to the [Guest] and Admin accounts in the Manage Security window. FM Step 5: Multi-file FileMaker Databases and User Accounts If your FileMaker solution includes multiple files, the above steps must be done in each file. For your database to work correctly, each user should be in every database file with exactly the same username and password. For example, if the above FileMaker database had three different .fmp12 files, the bobsmith user should be in each file with the same password in each file."

Email & Calendars,Fix Mail Delivery Issues on Mailman 3 Lists,"These troubleshooting steps are for Mailman list owners that encounter problems with mail delivery to @gmail.com list members. Issue Email delivery issues can happen when some email providers, such as Gmail, Yahoo, or AOL, reject or mark messages as spam that are sent from a list but have a different sender address. This is because these providers use email authentication to verify the authenticity of the sender and prevent spoofing and phishing. Resolution To improve the mail delivery issues on a Mailman list, on 5/14/2024 HUIT changed the default settings on all lists without the proper settings so that the From: address appears in the list address. This way, the list domain will match the sender domain, and the messages will pass the email authentication checks. The instructions to change the list settings manually follow: Go to the Mailman homepage and click on the Login button. Select the option to sign in with your HarvardKey and enter your username and password. Open the list you need to troubleshoot Click on Settings in the menu bar and click on DMARC Mitigations. For DMARC mitigation action, select Replace From: with list address from the dropdown. This will replace the original sender's Display name with [Senders display name] via [the list name] in the From: header.

Email & Calendars,Email Sender Policy Framework,"This article is for Harvard email users who have received a Sender Policy Framework warning on an incoming message. If an incoming email fails Sender Policy Framework (SPF) validation, you will see the following or similar warning at the top of an email: WARNING: Harvard cannot validate that this message was sent from an authorized system. Please be careful when opening attachments, clicking links, or following instructions. For more information, visit the HUIT IT Portal and search for SPF. What is SPF? Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication tool used by Harvard University Information Technology and other institutions to prevent fraudulent emails. Organizations publish a list of authorized systems to send emails on their behalf, known as their SPF record. Receiving email systems check the SPF record to validate the sender. If an email fails SPF validation, a warning message will appear at the top of the email. Not all emails from addresses that fail SPF are bad, and it is common for bulk emailers and other email services to “spoof” another organization's email domain to send notifications. If you receive an email with an SPF warning, take extra precautions before replying or clicking on any links. Carefully examine the email, familiarize yourself with common signs of phishing, and do not click on links or open attachments. Please follow these steps for any suspicious email: Look carefully at the email address to ensure that it matches the sender and their correct domain. Get familiar with the common signs of phishing. Do not click on links or open attachments. Do not download images. If you suspect a phishing email, forward it to phishing@harvard.edu. If you receive an SPF warning from an expected internal or external sender, submit a ticket to the Service Desk or notify the sender's IT department. SPF warning on email from expected sources Emails received from Harvard internal and external senders are checked for SPF validation. Occasionally, you may get a message from an expected source that has an SPF warning. If you get a warning on a message that appears to be from an expected internal Harvard sender, please submit a ticket to the Service Desk so that we can verify the authenticity of the sender. HUIT may be able to add information to our validation process to eliminate the warning. If you get a warning on a message that appears to be from an expected external sender, the sending entity will need to evaluate and adjust their systems to eliminate the warning. To resolve an issue with an external entity's SPF records, the IT department for that entity must be notified that email sent from their domain failed SPF validation.

Although there are no hard limits to how many folders a mailbox can contain or how many items a folder can contain, you might experience decreased performance as the number of folders and subfolders or nested folders grows. Resolution Here are some things you can try if you're having issues with subfolders folders in Outlook: Reduce the number of items/folders Microsoft recommends having fewer than 500 folders that contain subfolders, and no more than 450 subfolders per main folder.

Email providers (Google, Yahoo, etc) are increasing enforcement of email authentication in order to prevent spam and phishing in their environments starting in February 2024. To prevent delivery issues for bulk mailing services sending as Harvard domains, DKIM keys need to be set up for each 3rd party instance for each Harvard domain that is used so that recipient email providers have a way to authenticate email from Harvard senders. Create DKIM keys in 3rd party Please create a DKIM key for each 3rd party AND each domain used to send from that vendor and submit to HUIT on our DKIM Submission Form Here are instructions for getting DKIM keys from some popular email service providers. If the instructions below do not work for you, please contact your vendor and ask for assistance: Salesforce/Salesforce Marketing Cloud: Generating your own DKIM keys is dependent on on your subscription. If you have the ability to create your own DKIM keys, follow these instructions: Log in to your Salesforce/Salesforce Marketing Cloud account and go to Admin > Account > Domain Management Click ""Add Domain"" and enter your domain Click ""Generate DKIM Keys"" to create new public and private keys If you do not have the ability to create your own DKIM keys, follow these instructions: Work with your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account rep to purchase Private Domains for each domain/sub-domain that you send from. Once this is completed (Marketing Cloud team calls this a SKU), a parent case will be created in Marketing Cloud. After the parent case is created the Marketing Cloud back-end team will reach out with further communications and will take care of the complete configuration on the Marketing Cloud side, once they have the necessary details. Because Harvard will host the DNS on our end, the Marketing Cloud back-end team will provide a zone file which contains the necessary DNS records for successful configuration. This zone file needs to be submitted to HUIT to be implemented into the DNS records. Once HUIT confirms the DNS records are implemented you will need to update the Salesforce case to let them know it is implemented on Harvard’s side. Then, the Marketing Cloud back-end team will re-validate the DNS records, and will do the final steps to complete the configuration.

Resolution Google and other email providers are implementing stricter email authentication requirements to help keep inboxes free of malicious or unwanted email. Senders who don’t meet these requirements may experience delivery issues when sending emails. HUIT has spent the last several months setting up measures so that bulk emails sent from Harvard domains through the use of email marketing platforms (e.g., Mailchimp, Constant Contact) will pass email authentication. HUIT is also continuing work to ensure that Harvard-provided email services (Google Workspace and Microsoft 365) comply with these new authentication requirements. If you are forwarding email from a Harvard-provided Microsoft 365 account to a Harvard-provided Google Workspace account. Solution: Forwarding from Harvard provided Microsoft 365 account to a Harvard-provided Google Workspace account requires a specific forwarding domain.

Information Security,Keep your data and devices safe while traveling,"This guidance is for Harvard faculty, staff, students, and researchers who are planning travel and want to keep their personal and Harvard-issued devices and data as safe as possible. Faculty, staff and researchers planning travel to Cuba, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria or regions of Ukraine (Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Sevastopol) should also consult HUIT’s guidance on traveling to high cyber risk locations. If you are conducting research or planning to use university research data while traveling, consult Harvard’s research data management policies and Harvard's export control policies & procedures before departure. Before traveling to any country, visit the Harvard Global Support Services website for more country-specific guidance and to register your travel. You may also refer to local contacts or travel policies for your School*, if available: Harvard Law School Harvard Medical School Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health School security and data privacy officers *International students and scholars should consult with their advisor in the Harvard International Office before leaving the US to discuss US immigration actions, their individual circumstances, and the requirements and guidance to be able to re-enter the US. Prepare your device(s) for travel It's common for some governments to monitor and store Internet activity or copy data from your device without your consent. At your port of entry, some government authorities may request access to your electronic devices and accounts. This includes common border security measures in the United States. Before you leave, familiarize yourself with your destination’s IT security laws and practices and then prepare your devices for travel, by following these tips: Install updates to your software and operating systems to prevent cyber criminals from exploiting known bugs. Ensure that your passwords are strong, complex, and unique using a password manager like 1Password. Enable 2-step verification on your personal accounts, if available. Note: Both Duo and OKTA —the third-party tools that Harvard uses for 2-step verification—blocks authentications from OFAC-sanctioned countries and regions. Back up your data and media to a device you'll leave at home. Sanitize your devices to clear them of documents or media that could be perceived as provocative or inflammatory by certain governments. Less is best. Bring the least amount of information and data and the fewest devices possible. Download and set up device managers like Find my iPhone/iPad/Mac and Find My Device (for Android) to locate your device if lost or stolen and erase it remotely if needed. Encrypt your devices in case of loss or theft. Harvard-owned devices should be encrypted by policy. Check with your local IT department to ensure that your system is encrypted. Certain countries restrict encrypted devices; if you're traveling to a country that does so, contact your local IT department. Use your device while traveling Turn off your device, or at least the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, when crossing through security checkpoints and when not in use. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) if using hotel or public Wi-Fi. A VPN creates a more secure connection between your device and the resources you access. Certain countries may restrict or ban VPN usage; if you're traveling to a country that does so and would like more guidance, request an Information Security and Data Privacy consultation. Limit use of public terminals, and don’t use accounts requiring usernames and passwords—especially for Harvard accounts—on public machines. Clear your Internet browser after each use to delete your history, cookies, cache, and downloaded or temporary files. Alternatively, use your browser’s private browsing or incognito feature. Report incidents, such as suspected or actual device compromise, loss, or data exposure. Upon your return, secure your device Run antivirus software to scan your device for malware and follow the instructions to correct any issues. Reset passwords for accounts you accessed over public wifi (e.g., unsecured guest network) Report incidents, such as suspected or actual device compromise, loss, or data exposure.

Information Security,Vendor Risk Assessment FAQs,"Frequently Asked Questions Question: What is a Vendor Risk Assessment? Answer: A Vendor Risk Assessment (VRA) is an assessment of an organization’s security, confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy policies and practices. VRAs help us make informed decisions when selecting a vendor to collect, handle, store, or host Harvard data. Question: Is a VRA required? Answer: Vendors intended to have access to DSL4 data/systems must have a Vendor Risk Assessment per Harvard University Information Security Policy. V3: The security design, policies, and procedures of vendors and other third parties who will collect, process, host or store Level 4 information or manage Harvard critical systems must be reviewed by a University Information Security Officer. Question: What do I need to do to ensure my vendor with Data Security Level 3 or 4 data complies with policy? Answer: A contract must be executed with the vendor by a university negotiating office, such as Harvard Strategic Procurement. The contract must incorporate specific privacy and security riders approved by the Office of the General Counsel and may require additional GDPR or accessibility related terms and conditions. Depending on your use case and data classification, it may include High Risk Confidential Information (HRCI) Rider(s) as well as GDPR, accessibility, HIPAA/BAA terms, as appropriate. To submit a contract review request to the Strategic Procurement Contracts team use the following Qualtrics Survey tool. If contracting with a vendor for a hosted service (for example, a SaaS) it must be integrated with university central authentication, usually Harvard Key, for identity and access management, and multi-factor authentication of authorized users by DUO. To register your platform, initiate a request here: Authentication & Attribute Registration CAS/SAML/SP Usage Request Vendors and other third parties who will collect, process, host or store Level 4 information or manage Harvard critical systems must be reviewed by a University Information Security Officer for a Vendor Risk Assessment Question: Can a review be requested for a vendor who has access to Data Security Level 3 information? Answer: Yes, if you feel it will help make an informed decision or aid you in contract negotiation we can perform a light weight assessment on the vendor for you although it is not a policy requirement. Question: How do I request a Vendor Risk Assessment? Answer: To initiate a VRA, complete the VRA intake questionnaire. A member of the University Information Security and Data Privacy (ISDP) team will then review the request and contact you before initiating the related vendor activities. Question: When does a Vendor Risk Assessment occur? Answer: Contract review may happen in parallel with the VRA, but the contract should not be executed before the VRA is completed. Additionally, at contract renewal (normally every 3 years) or when major changes are made to the contract it is a good time to leverage the vendor for an updated assessment. Question: How long does the VRA process take to complete? Answer: The first phase of the VRA process requires the vendor to complete a robust security questionnaire and for Data Security Level 4 vendors they provide validation of selected controls. Depending on the maturity and resource availability of the vendor's security team this can be time consuming, we recommend initiating the VRA 6-8 weeks prior to your contract date when possible to allow the vendor adequate time to respond. Question: What can I do to ensure a quick Vendor Risk Assessment? Answer: Not every vendor will be willing to negotiate a contract that differs from their standard contract or click-through agreement. Ask first, not every vendor is prepared to handle regulated data and/or other high-risk data types (DSL4). Review the vendor’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If it’s a vendor hosted product, look for elements like Limitations of Use statements that prohibit users from uploading certain regulated data types such as personally identifiable information, governmental ids, health or medical information, clinical data, etc. If you see language like this, it is potentially an indicator that the vendor may not wish to collect, store, host or process DSL4 data. Keep your vendor engaged and quick in frequently to see how they are progressing. Question: How do I know my vendor is ready to perform a Vendor Risk Assessment? Answer: A vendor with a mature security program will monitor for vulnerabilities and address them. They will also participate in external security audits and make third party audit reports like the SOC 2, SSAE 18, or ISAE 3402 available to customers. Ask if your vendor offers any of these reports available for review. If they do, it’s likely they will respond quick to the assessment. If vendor security information is published, check to see that your data will be protected by encryption (at rest, in transit, or both), and review security terms for important but often overlooked aspects of the data lifecycle such as data retention, archiving, and data destruction at termination of service. Question: Where can I locate existing Vendor Risk Assessments? Answer: Buy to Pay has a repository of the Vendor Risk Assessments the Information Security Educational & Consulting team have completed. A member from your negotiating office should have access to pull the report on your behalf. Question: Can I share the findings of the assessment with my vendor? Answer: If the vendor has completed the assessment within the CyberGRX portal the vendor has a full copy of the findings and mitigation steps to reduce the risk identified in their environment. All reports written by the Information Security Education & Consulting team are considered internal use only and not to be shared with external parties.

Information Security,"Respond to online abuse, harassment, and intimidation","In recent years, there has been an increase in incidents of online harassment from outsiders targeted at the academic community. Students, faculty, staff, postdocs, and other academic appointees who publish articles, provide expert commentary, or are active on social media can become targets for online harassment. Online harassment can take different forms: “Trolling” occurs when individuals deliberately follow and provoke others online, often with offensive content. While most trolling is merely a nuisance, occasionally trolling attacks can escalate to threats or to the point where numerous individuals are engaged in harassing the target and/or target’s organization. “Doxing” (sometimes “doxxing”) occurs under Harvard’s policies when a community member publicly shares an individual’s personal information without their permission with the intention and effect of intense harassment. (Full definition of doxing) “Cyberbullying” is the willful and repeated harm inflicted through using computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices. These situations can be very intense, alarming, and disruptive to an individual. Online targeting can also have real consequences for livelihoods and careers. Harvard provides this information as a resource for community members who have been identified and targeted for online abuse, harassment, and intimidation. Please note the following guidance contains resources and information on reporting incidents of cyber-bullying, doxing, or trolling. It is not the process for reporting conduct that violates or may violate the University’s harassment/discrimination/bullying policy. You can find information about that policy here.

Managing Abuse and Harassment on Social Media Delisting from University Directories Requesting a FERPA Block Email Filtering Additional Online Services Counseling Services Addendum: Templates of Takedown Requests Additional Help What Recourse Do I Have Against Online Abuse and Harassment? Steps you can take to combat online abuse and harassment include (1) requesting takedowns of false statements that may have been made in error, (2) requesting that platforms and web domain registrars remove abusive content, (3) documenting the abuse (i.e., preserving evidence), (4) reporting threats and other criminal misconduct to law enforcement, and (5) obtaining legal advice regarding consequences to you and possible civil actions against abusers. Legal action may be of limited utility in these matters. We discuss this in more detail in the sections below. Requests to Take Down False Statements If an organization has posted false or misleading statements about you on its website, social media accounts, or elsewhere, and these statements are causing you to suffer harm, you may consider sending a written request to the organization to remove or correct the statements. In such a communication it is important that you (1) identify yourself, (2) identify the statements that are false or misleading, (3) explain why the statements are false or misleading, and (4) describe how the statements are harming you. Not all such requests will be successful, but longstanding organizations with financial resources and credibility in the broader community may see that correcting false, harmful information is in their self-interest. Takedown requests directed to individual user accounts on social media platforms may not be as well received—especially if the accounts are anonymous or pseudonymous. An example of a request to take down false information is attached below (“Sample Request To Take Down False Statements”). If the recipient of your initial request ignores or declines it, you may consider engaging an attorney to write a follow-up letter on your behalf. In cases where a user account has posted false or misleading statements about you on a social media or other publishing platform, you may have the additional option of reporting the content to the platform. See the next section below. Generally speaking, social media sites are reluctant to referee disputes over whether the content of a particular post is true or false. Indeed, you are likely to find that the applicable community standards or guidelines do not prohibit false statements (as opposed to, say, impersonations). Accordingly, while the platform may seem to be a more rational and objective actor than the user account, you may find that the platform does not act on the report. Note: Before you submit a request to take down harmful content, you should save a copy of the content in order to preserve evidence of the abuse. See below (“Document What’s Happening”). Requests To Take Down Abusive, Harassing, or Threatening Posts/Web Content If a user account has posted abusive, harassing, or threatening statements about you or directed at you on a social media or other publishing platform, you may submit a takedown request to the platform, in accordance with the platform’s rules and requirements, several of which we have linked here: Blogger/ Blogspot: Content Policy, Report a Community Violation. Facebook: Community Standards, Report Something. Instagram/ Threads: Community Guidelines, How to Report Things. Sidechat: Community Guidelines. Users may report a post for removal by emailing support@sidechat.lol. Substack: Content Guidelines (“If you encounter content that may be in breach of these guidelines or have any questions about them, you can email us at tos@substackinc.com.”). TikTok: Community Guidelines, Report a Problem. Truth Social: Terms of Use § 7 (“Prohibited Activities”). We were unable to find a reporting function on Truth Social, but § 32 of the Terms of Use document states as follows: “In order to resolve a complaint regarding the Service or to receive further information regarding use of the Service, please contact us at support@truthsocial.com. “Users may report ‘hateful conduct,’ as defined by New York law, to legal@tmtgcorp.com.” Wordpress: User Guidelines, Report a Site. X/ Twitter: The X Rules, Report Violations. YouTube: Community Guidelines. To report content on YouTube, you can click the “Report” button underneath the video frame on each video’s webpage. To reveal the “Report” button, click the icon with three dots on it, just under the right-bottom corner of the video. In cases where abusive content is posted on a website operated by the speakers themselves (rather than, say, Facebook or Substack), you may still be able to request that it be taken down. Many companies that provide web hosting services have their own community standards/acceptable use policies and allow visitors to websites to report abuse. We have included some prominent web hosting vendors in the list below: DreamHost: Acceptable Use Policy, Report Abuse. GoDaddy: Universal Terms of Service § 5 (“General Rules of Conduct”), Report Abuse. Hostinger: Universal Terms of Service § 5 (“General Rules of Conduct”), Report Abuse. WP Engine: Acceptable Use Policy. Users may report violations of the Acceptable Use Policy to abuse@wpengine.com or (512) 273-3906. Each social media platform or web hosting service applies its own standards and principles in reviewing and acting on requests to take down content. As noted above, platforms are reluctant to referee disputes over whether the content of a particular post is true or false. They are far more likely to take action against communications that are abusive, harassing, or threatening or that impersonate you or seek to mislead or defraud the viewer. You can find more details on each site’s rules and reporting pages. We generally do not recommend that you engage directly with a social media account or website that is targeting you with abuse, harassment, or threats. If you see content on a social media platform or website that is directed at you and violates the site’s community standards, you should report the content to the platform or web host. An example of a request to take down abusive, harassing, or threatening posts is attached below (“Sample Request To Take Down Abusive, Harassing, or Threatening Posts/Web Content”). Note: Before you submit a request to take down harmful content, you should save a copy of the content in order to preserve evidence of the abuse. See below (“Document What’s Happening”). Requests To De-Register Abusive Domain Names We are aware of instances in which an online harasser has registered the names of individual persons as web domains and established websites at those domains to host online attacks on the named persons. It may be possible to have these domain names de-registered. The first step is to conduct a “whois” search to identify what domain registrar company (e.g., Domain.com, GoDaddy) has registered the domain. Requests To Domain Name Registrars. To perform a “whois” search, go to https://lookup.icann.org/en and enter the domain name into the search window. The search results will display, among other things, “Domain Information,” “Contact Information,” and “Registrar Information.” The Registrar Information block identifies the domain registrar. The Contact Information block displays the contact information for the person who registered the domain, which may be a proxy company that has been paid to register the domain name on the actual user’s behalf, so that you cannot tell who is really operating the website. In any case, several links will appear in the Contact Information block that, if clicked, will take you to the domain registrar’s website. The landing page on the domain registrar’s website should display a phone number and email you can contact to report abuse to the registrar. In addition, the registrar’s website will likely provide information about community standards for its registrants and how to report violations of its policies. Links to this information can usually be found in the footer of the website behind links that say “Legal,” “Terms of Use,” or “Terms of Service.” We have collected below the community standards policies and reporting information posted by several popular domain registrars. The first link in each line is to information about the registrar’s content standards: i.e., what is allowed on their registered websites and what is not. The second link is to information about how to report abuse. Domain.com: Acceptable Use Policy, Report Member Violations. DreamHost: Acceptable Use Policy, Report Abuse. GoDaddy: Universal Terms of Service § 5 (“General Rules of Conduct”), Report Abuse. Hostinger: Universal Terms of Service § 5 (“General Rules of Conduct”), Report Abuse. Namecheap: Acceptable Use Policy, Report Abuse. Porkbun: Product Terms of Service (“Acceptable Use Policy” section), Report Abuse. If you use the registrar’s abuse reporting function and the registrar agrees that the website registered under your name has violated its content policies, the registrar may de-register the domain name. De-registration of a domain name is a big step for a registrar to take, and it will be more likely to take that step if the domain name contributes to violations of the registrar’s rules. In cases where the site posts abusive content but the domain name itself is not objectionable, a takedown request to the web hosting company is more likely to be successful than a request to decommission the domain name. (In many cases the domain registrar also provides web hosting services for the site.) An example of a request to de-register domain names is attached below (“Sample Request To De-Register Abusive Domain Names”). You can use the same template to submit a de-registration request to a domain name registry. The fact that one domain registrar company has taken steps to de-register a domain does not mean that the harasser cannot go to another registrar to re-register the name. Accordingly, you may need to visit the domain name periodically to see if it has been re-registered and is posting the abusive content again. If so, you will need to do another whois search and report abuse to the current registrar. Alternatively, you can register the domain name yourself, so that you can exclude others from using it. Note: Before you submit a request to de-register a domain name, you should save a copy of all the content posted on the website in question in order to preserve evidence of the abuse. See below (“Document What’s Happening”). Requests To Domain Name Registries. In addition to reporting abuse to a domain name registrar, you may also try reporting abuse to a domain name registry. A registry is an organization that controls the registration of all domain names within a top-level domain (“TLD”) like “.com” or “.org.” The registry for .com and .net domains is Verisign, and the registry for .org domains is the Public Interest Registry. We have gathered the following information about reporting abuse to these organizations: Verisign: “For any inquiries related to malicious conduct in the Verisign managed TLDs please contact Verisign at … abuse@verisign.com.” Public Interest Registry: Anti-Abuse Policy (generally disfavoring suspension of domain names, except in rare cases, such as “credible and specific incitements to violence” and “credible threats to human health or safety”), Report Abuse. Our sense is that it may be more difficult to persuade a domain-name registry to de-register than to persuade a registrar to do so, so you should first try the applicable registrar. Note: Before you submit a request to de-register a domain name, you should save a copy of all the content posted on the website in question in order to preserve evidence of the abuse. See below (“Document What’s Happening”). Document What's Happening If you are experiencing online abuse, harassment, or threats, you should take steps to preserve evidence of the communications. Save any emails, voicemails, or text messages you receive. Take screenshots or photos of comments on social media; because such comments can be deleted, screenshots are often useful to help document them. While it may seem counterintuitive to hold onto messages or posts that are upsetting, it can be helpful down the line to have retained evidence of an attack, particularly one involving threats. Create a folder separate and apart from your live accounts and store copies or 5 screenshots of the abusive communications inside it. This way you can keep the evidence without having to see the communications again and again as you use these systems. Reporting Criminal Conduct States, including Massachusetts, have written criminal laws to protect their residents against harassment and intimidation. The Massachusetts criminal harassment statute makes it a crime to “willfully and maliciously engage[] in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person, which seriously alarms that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress.” The Massachusetts antistalking law makes it a crime to “(1) willfully and maliciously engage[] in a knowing pattern of conduct or series of acts over a period of time directed at a specific person which seriously alarms or annoys that person and would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress, and (2) make[] a threat with the intent to place the person in imminent fear of death or bodily injury.” Either of these criminal offenses may be accomplished online, if the online communications satisfy the elements of the crime and the conduct consists of true threats unprotected by the First Amendment. If you or those close to you are in imminent physical danger or there has been a direct threat of physical violence, you should immediately call the Harvard University Police Department at (617) 495-1212 if you are on the Harvard campus. If you are not on campus, call 911. If there is no immediate physical threat, but you have received a credible threat to your personal safety or feel you have been criminally harassed, you may call HUPD at (617) 4951212. You may wish to ask HUPD what is involved in seeking a Harassment Prevention Order. Seeking Immigration Help Some members of the community may have questions about how abusive or harassing online conduct may affect their immigration status or prospects. International students can reach out to their advisor in the Harvard International Office with concerns related to their immigration status. Harvard Law School’s Harvard Representation Initiative (“HRI”) may also be able to answer your questions. HRI’s main phone line is (617) 495-6648, and its emergency line is (857) 242-6755. You may also reach out directly to HRI by emailing hri@law.harvard.edu for a free consultation. Legal Consultations You may wish to explore whether to pursue a legal complaint for online harassment. In doing so, be sure to explore with your lawyer the benefits and risks of pursuing a legal claim, the cost of doing so, and the barriers to a successful claim. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Massachusetts state constitution accord considerable legal protection to expression on matters of public interest. This does not mean, however, that the right to free speech bars all lawsuits based on the defendant’s expression. Rather, courts factor First Amendment considerations into their review of civil 6 claims. For example, a person who is the subject of untrue statements injurious to their reputation may bring a lawsuit for defamation, but the First Amendment accords some space to speakers who make a false statement, based on their level of fault. When evaluating whether to pursue a civil claim against a doxer or other person or entity engaging in online abuse, harassment, and intimidation, ask your counsel what you can expect in litigation. Because civil cases are public proceedings, they may have the effect of amplifying the doxer’s message to a broader audience—or at least prolonging your exposure to public attention. Civil discovery can be an intrusive proposition, as the other side may be entitled to access and review private communications or documents that could relate to the subject of the lawsuit. This means that your emails, texts, and social media posts may be disclosed to the opposing party. Finally, litigation can be expensive, so you may wish to explore fee arrangements. Will your counsel take your case on a contingency basis, where they are awarded a percentage of fees if you are successful in getting money damages? Is the matter of such interest to them that they would consider representing you on a pro bono basis? What Else Can I Do to Protect Myself? Managing Abuse and Harassment on Social Media Online harassment of any kind can be extremely stressful. In addition to support that is available through your School or law enforcement, the following actions may help individuals respond to a difficult situation occurring online: Consider temporarily disabling your social media profiles or switching them to private. This will ensure that only your close connections can post or comment in your feed. Ignore the communications. Although your first instinct may be to respond and defend yourself online, responding to harassing messages can tend to prolong and inflame incidents. Often the objective of social media agitators is to elicit a response, which they can use to raise their profile still further. In addition, your response may provide more opportunity for harassment: i.e., the online abuser will find a way to mischaracterize, take out of context, and cast what you say in the worst possible light. Trolls may—but do not always—move on to other targets if you ignore them long enough. Stick to the facts. If you do feel that a response is necessary, try to adhere to the following guidelines: (1) stick to facts that are not open to interpretation; (2) keep your response short, concise, and above all factual; (3) correct inaccuracies and move on; (4) avoid adopting an aggressive or defensive tone and resist the temptation to “fight fire with fire.” Mute the attacker. Most social media platforms allow users to “mute” particular accounts. Muting another user means that user’s communications are not viewable to you. The muted party ordinarily is not notified that you have muted them and may still comment on your social media posts, but you will not need to see those comments. If you are worried a muted user’s comments may become threatening, ask a friend or colleague to check your feed on your behalf. Block the attacker. Several social media platforms allow you to “block” other accounts, meaning that they can longer follow you, see your posts, or comment on your content. Unless you have also muted the account, you will still be able to see a blocked user’s posts. Social media platforms ordinarily notify users when another account blocks them. Accordingly, they may choose to attack you elsewhere on the platform. Delisting from University Directories If you are concerned that online harassers can find you on campus or use your Harvard email or phone number to direct harmful communications to you, you may request that some or all of your personal information be removed from University directories. Students may adjust the settings for their profiles in Harvard directories by following these instructions. Faculty and staff can follow the instructions here. Note that University faculty and staff will need to provide a brief explanation for their request. Note: Members of the community should be aware that these instructions may not result in the delisting of all Harvard-related programs and activities. Reach out to your Harvard affiliations (academic department, extracurricular activities, etc.) if you wish to make a similar request. Requesting a FERPA Block Students may also direct their Schools not to disclose information that their Schools have designated as “directory information” under FERPA, the federal student privacy law. Under FERPA, Schools may disclose a student’s directory information to any person, unless the student opts out of such disclosures. Click here for more information about what qualifies as “directory information” here at Harvard. We call these opt-outs “FERPA blocks.” To institute a FERPA block, please contact your School’s Registrar’s Office.

Information Security,InCommon Certificate Manager FAQs,"InCommon Certificate Manager FAQs What is the InCommon Certificate Manager Service? The InCommon Certificate Service, created by and for the higher education community, provides unlimited SSL/TLS and client certificates for one low membership fee. This includes unlimited Organizational Validation (OV) SSL/TLS certificates, Extended Validation (EV) SSL/TLS certificates, client (or personal) certificates, and code-signing certificates. Do I have to use this service to create or manage my SSL Certificates? No. Although University schools and administrative units are encouraged to take advantage of the unlimited SSL Certificate service, these groups may use other Certificate Authorities (CA) for issuing SSL Certificate(s), if desired. Which domains are eligible for certificates? All hostnames within the harvard.edu domain are eligible for certificates through the enterprise InCommon agreement. How do I request access for myself or for a colleague? Please fill out the request form found here: https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=54fac1af1bb5bc105b1d3333cc4bcb53 Where can I find Certificate Manager user guides? View the https://sectigo.com/knowledge-base/product/admin_guides page for certificate manager documentation, including the Sectigo® Certificate Manager (SCM) Administrator's Guide I've been granted administrator access to the InCommon portal. What is my role and scope? Certificate administrators are granted the Department Registration Authority Officer (DRAO), which allows you to perform specific certificate management related duties scoped to domains or sub-domains associated with your department or organizational area. What if I need to transfer my DRAO role to someone else? If you are vacating your duties as the DRAO, or know of someone that is no longer in that position, contact ithelp@harvard.edu to updated. Can I assign a backup DRAO? Yes. It is highly recommended for business continuity that you have at least one designated backup certificate administrator for your department/organization. I'm having trouble logging in. How do I get user support? If you use Harvard Key for InCommon federated login, ensure that you are using your unique IdP URL and your federated credentials to log in. If your Harvard Key credentials have changed, account maintenance may be needed. For this or other login assistance book a HUIT Service Desk request for assistance. I am having trouble with InCommon. How do I get user support? HUIT does not directly support the InCommon/Sectigo Certificate manager platform. For product or technical support, book a helpdesk request directly with the vendor, following the on-page instructions for correct routing to either InCommon or to Sectigo. If the user support that you receive from the vendor does not resolve your issue, you may book a HUIT Service Desk ticket and request escalation assistance from HUIT. Is there an InCommon user community that I can join? Yes! The cert-users email list provides a forum for subscribers to the InCommon Certificate Service. List members share relevant information and can ask questions. Sign up here. What kind of turnaround time can I expect from InCommon? The information security concept of ""segregation of duties"" is enforced within InCommon for certain certificate management activities. What this means in practice is that some activities may be initiated by a DRAO but must be approved by a RAO or MRAO before the process can be completed. While most approval requests can be met within 24 business hours, the vendor guarantees a 48-72 business hour turnaround time on all certificate management requests. NOTE: Administrative approvals are not issued outside of normal business hours. Therefore, please plan accordingly. Why do I no longer see a three year renewal option for my certificates? In accordance with the CA/Browser Forum Baseline Requirements, effective March 1, 2018, Certificate Authorities (CAs) will no longer be able to issue SSL Certificates with a validity period longer than 27-months. Certificate FAQs Where can I re-download my certificate? Go to https://cert-manager.com/customer/InCommon/ssl?action=download You will be prompted for: Your Certificate ID (which was in the e-mail received when your certificate was issued) SSL certificate format desired (Binary, Base64) What are Wildcard certificates? A Wildcard SSL Certificate secures your Web site URL and an unlimited number of its sub-domains. The Wildcard SSL Certificate works the same way as a regular SSL certificate and undergoes the same validation processes. The difference is that the Wildcard SSL Certificate extends to all of the sub-domains of your domain that you want to secure. Are there any risk concerns on the use of Wildcard certificates? Yes. Wildcard certificates, when compromised by attackers, have the potential to be far more damaging to Harvard University and affiliate organizations than standard SSL certificates, since they could be used to spoof any host in the domain of the Wildcard. Placing copies of the Wildcard certificates and their accompanying keypairs on multiple machines also increases the attack surface of the certificates. What is an ""Intermediate"" Certificate? An intermediate certificate is the certificate(s) that go between your site (server) certificate and a root certificate. The intermediate certificate(s) completes the chain to a root certificate trusted by the browser. Using an intermediate certificate means that you must complete an additional step in the installation process to enable your site certificate to be chained to the trusted root, and not show errors in the browser when someone visits your web site. Can I get a certificate for a host in a non-harvard.edu domain? To ensure the University's compliance with the InCommon agreement, requests for certificates outside of harvard.edu domains are subject to extra vetting and approval, by both the University and possibly InCommon."
Information Security,Configure external storage media securely,"This guide is for Harvard FAS/CADM students, faculty, staff, contractors, and consultants with an active Harvard affiliation, who want to ensure the security of confidential and sensitive data on external storage media. Steps to take Storage Media Selection Use 256-Bit AES encrypted and PIN/password protected external hard drives, solid state drives (SSDs), USB, or flash keys. For data subject to international regulations, HIPAA, CUI, FCI, or L5 research data, select external storage media certified to meet FIPS 140-2/FIPS 140-3/FIPS 197 standards. Reference: NIST Cryptographic Module Validation Program. Manage Passwords Store passwords and PINs in a reliable password manager to avoid loss. Be cautious, as loss of a password/PIN results in loss of access to your data. Note that certain encryption-enabled devices may auto-erase data after several failed attempts to access. Physical Security Keep physical possession of external devices and lock them when not in use. Protect devices from environmental conditions and shocks that might cause damage. Be sure to use the devices as per the manufacturer's instructions for optimal maintenance. Data Backups Regularly back up data to safeguard against device failure. Stay Updated and Upgrade Upgrade storage media as industry standards evolve or technology advances. Ensure that archival or legacy media containing confidential or sensitive data is securely managed according to its risk classification during its retention period. Secure Disposal Ensure the device is securely destroyed at the end of its lifecycle to prevent unauthorized access to data. Best Practices: Always ensure alignment with the latest industry standards and institutional guidelines for handling sensitive and/or confidential information. Regularly review and refresh protocols to maintain security. Get help Chat: Log in to chat live with a HUIT technician Submit a ticket Call: (617) 495-7777"
Information Security,How to create a strong password,"This guide is for Harvard students, faculty, staff, contractors, and consultants with an active Harvard affiliation, who would like to create a strong password. For more information about protecting systems and data, use the Information Security and Data Privacy team website. How to Create Strong Passwords & Passphrases Stay Safe with These Simple Tips Protecting your online accounts starts with a strong password. Fortunately, secure passwords don’t have to be complicated or hard to remember. By following a few best practices, you can create strong, memorable passphrases that keep your information safe. What Makes a Password Strong? A strong password or passphrase should meet these guidelines: Use both uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z) Include at least one number (0-9) Add a symbol (such as !, #, or %) Be at least twelve characters long—the longer, the better! Passphrases with eighteen or more characters offer optimal protection. Avoid using personal details like birthdays, names, or common words—and never use “password” or any version of it. Tips for Creating a Memorable Passphrase Instead of using a hard-to-remember jumble of characters, you can create a passphrase from a series of random words. This is easy to remember and much harder for others to guess. Try this method: Pick four or five random letters as your guide (for example: C D F T). Create a phrase using words that start with those letters (e.g., Curious Dolphins Fly Together). Combine the words into a single passphrase: CuriousDolphinsFlyTogether (don’t use this exact example—make your own unique phrase). Add numbers or symbols if needed: Curious1Dolphins!FlyTogether Aim for length: The more characters you use (over 18 is ideal), the stronger your passphrase becomes. If you struggle to manage multiple passwords, consider using a password manager. Harvard community members have access to 1Password at no cost. Extra Security Steps Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Always turn on MFA for important accounts (like email, financial systems, and social media). MFA adds another layer of protection by requiring something you know (your password), and something you have (like your phone), or something you are (like a fingerprint or your face—called biometrics). Use biometrics if available: Many devices and apps now offer fingerprint or face recognition as part of their security. When combined with a password or passcode, biometrics make your accounts and devices even more secure and convenient. Keep passwords private: Never share your passwords with anyone. Official support services will never ask for your password by phone or email. Try a password manager: A password manager like 1Password can securely store all your passwords in one place. What About Phones, Tablets & Device Passcodes? Many smartphones, tablets, and computers use shorter PINs or passcodes for quick access. Here’s what you need to know: Shorter passcodes: Devices may allow 4-6 digit PINs. Choose random codes that aren’t easy to guess—avoid simple patterns like 123456 or your birthday. Biometric authentication: Most devices now support fingerprint scans or facial recognition. This makes it convenient to unlock your device securely, but you’ll still be asked for your passcode occasionally (for example, after restarting or if biometrics don’t work). Best practice: Enable biometric features when available, and set a strong, unique passcode as your backup. For any apps or accounts containing sensitive information (like banking or email), always use a strong, unique password or passphrase in addition to device-level security. University Standard If you are setting a password on a university system, always follow the official password and security policies about password complexity and password sharing (such as those required for HarvardKey or other university systems). By following these best practices, you’ll help keep your online accounts, devices, and personal information much more secure—easily and effectively!

IT Provider Services,Going on vacation? Designate a delegate in ServiceNow,"These instructions are for any ServiceNow user who needs delegate their responsibilities to another person. This allows someone else to fill in while you're out of the office, handling your approvals and working your tickets. A delegate is able to view and interact with approvals and tasks assigned or sent to you, and to receive copies of all email notifications sent to you. Delegate your responsibilities within ServiceNow Navigate to your user profile within the ServiceNow main navigation pane, using the drop down arrow next to your username click Profile. To add a new delegate, click New under the Delegates tab. In the Delegate field type the name of the person you wish to delegate your responsibilities or use the search magnifying glass to find them. Set the duration of your absence in the ""Starts"" and ""Ends"" fields. The “Starts” date/time defaults to today’s date and time -- it is editable. Select the type of responsibilities you wish to delegate to this person (you may check one or more boxes): Approvals: The delegate can make approvals on your behalf. Assignments: The delegate can view and work on tickets assigned to you. Tickets assigned to you will appear in your delegate’s “My Work” queues. CC notifications: The delegate receives a copy of email notifications sent to you, except those marked Meeting Invitation. Meeting invitations: The delegate receives a copy any meeting invitations sent to you by the ServiceNow system (for example Change calendar invitations). Click Save or Submit to enter your changes. Save will record the transaction and keep you on the same form, while Submit will save the Delegate record and transfer you back to the main navigation form. Things to keep in mind Be sure delegates know up-front that they are assuming responsibility while you’re away. Delegates should only be active system users. You may delegate different responsibilities to different people. It is important to note that delegation is NOT system retroactive. Delegates do not own your tickets or approvals, delegates work on your behalf while you retain ownership of those records. Users to whom you delegate responsibility see all pending tasks and approvals regardless of the delegation period. Delegation does not cascade. When a user acts as a delegate for another user, the delegate cannot in turn delegate to a third party. The original delegate is the only user who receives assignments and notifications. Need help?

IT Provider Services,HUIT Change Management: What are the key components of a change request ticket?,"QUESTION: What are the key components of a change request ticket? ANSWER: The key components of a change request ticket are lifecycle, planning, and the implementation rating. Lifecycle: Initiate - Initiate a ServiceNow Change Request ticket. Assess - Determine change type and assess Risk as necessary Assign - Identify Services and Configuration Items potentially affected. Develop and document Implementation, Communications, Testing, and Backout plans. Schedule - Identify responsible support group and assignee. Submit - Submit the change request for approval as necessary. Implement - Initiate the communications plan as necessary and implement the change. Complete - Complete the Change Request ticket and additional tasks as necessary Planning: All Change Requests require a detailed accounting of all services impacted or potentially impacted by the change implementation, and the degree to which their functionality will be affected or interrupted. Include any change or impact to the user experience. Communications Plan: All Change Requests require that communications be addressed. At a minimum, the following questions need to be answered by the communications plan for each Change Request, unless no communications are necessary: Who is the target audience? What is the message? What is the notification method? When will notification(s) be sent? Back-out Plan: All Change Requests require that back-out measures be addressed. A plan summary should be included in the Change Request ticket. Back-out plans should seek to minimize organizational impact of a failed Change. When possible, it is beneficial to predefine a “trigger” condition that initiates the back-out plan, or identify a specific point in the implementation timeline at which a back-out decision is made. In circumstances in which no back- out plan is feasible, every effort should be made to mitigate the potential risk of organizational impact if the change is unsuccessful. The primary accountability for defining and, if necessary, engaging a back-out plan resides with the requester or implementer of an individual Change Request, or of the project with which the Change Request is associated. Testing Plan: All Change Requests require that testing be addressed. Change Management is responsible for confirming that a test plan, where feasible, exists. As a rule, testing should be conducted whenever possible; it may include functional, QA, and user acceptance testing, or other testing as appropriate. Additionally, testing should be conducted as possible after a change has taken place as part of a typical implementation plan to ensure that impacted services are fully functional. Ideally, the following information should be included in the Change Request ticket: Staff member(s) responsible for testing Dates during which testing occurred Details of testing environment, as appropriate Outcome of testing, with details as appropriate Implementation Rating: Upon completion, all Changes receive an Implementation Rating that assesses the overall quality of the change implementation. The change is rated using the following criteria: Rating (→) Successful Problems Encountered Change Failed Criteria (↓) Rollback Unnecessary True True False No Unplanned Service Interruption True Either Is False N/A Completed All Work Within Change Window True False N/A The Implementation Rating should be documented in the Change Request ticket, with additional information attached as necessary to provide details that explain the reason for the rating."

IT Provider Services,"HUIT Change Management: When is Change ""Freeze""?","QUESTION: When is Change ""Freeze""? ANSWER: To ensure the availability of services when they are most critical, the Change Management process adheres closely to the academic calendar. The weeks surrounding term startup events have been identified as “change freeze periods” – time periods during which additional caution and scrutiny of changes are warranted. During term startup change freeze, no significant changes to critical services or major project deployments should be scheduled. Exceptions are permitted with approval from at least three of five operational Managing Directors. For each term startup event, HUIT identifies services considered critical to the success of Startup. The overall list of critical services is focused on, but not limited to, services that are essential to: on-boarding students, faculty and staff, course delivery, communications and support. Change Freeze Periods Business Event Event Duration Event Start Event End Fall Term Startup 4 weeks Monday 2 weeks prior to first week of classes Friday 1 week after first week of classes Spring Term Startup 2 weeks Monday 1 week prior to first week of classes Friday of first week of classes Summer Term Startup 2 weeks Monday before move-in weekend Friday of first week of classes HUIT's Change Freeze periods and Major Maintenance Windows schedule are determined per Harvard's academic calendar and they are published in ServiceNow under Change > Business Events (through 2025). Purpose of Change ""Freeze"" Provide a smooth academic term start-up experience for students, faculty, and staff Ensure availability of academic and supporting services when they are most critical (e.g., HarvardKey and Wireless Networking) Focus staff time and effort on service delivery (vs. firefighting) at times of increased activity during academic year Supersede regular maintenance windows In Scope Out of Scope Applications and services deemed critical for Term Start-up (Enterprise) Release Management* No high-risk changes No major project deployments *Enterprise releases are planned based on business partners’ calendars Term Startup Exception Guidelines Exception requests should be made via email to Patricia Boyle-McKenna, Emily Bottis, Steph Gumble, Jason Shaffner, and Courtney Harwood using the change freeze exception mailing list (and the exception request template per KB0013586). For more information see KB0013586 ""HUIT Change Management: What are Change Freeze and Term Startup Exception Guidelines?"""
IT Provider Services,Application Authorization using HarvardKey and Grouper,"Please note: Harvard will be retiring support for CAS in 2026 and will stop accepting requests to integrate with HarvardKey using the CAS protocol effective October 1, 2024. Web applications using the CAS or SAML protocols that register with HarvardKey for SSO are also provided with some level of default authorized access. Implemented by applying an Application Authorization Filter in the application’s HarvardKey registration. See below for more details. Can alleviate the need for applications to implement authorization measures, as it is all done by HarvardKey, or it can be an initial layer of authorization on top of authorization done by the application itself. Is specified by application owners in their HarvardKey Application Integration Registration Form with additional consulting if necessary. An optional Group MemberOf Attribute Release may also be requested in the HarvardKey registration, which provides a person’s group membership information via the CAS/SAML assertion response when they log into the application. This group information can be used by the application to assign finer grain authorization (e.g., admin permissions). See below for more details. How an Application Authorization Filter works with HarvardKey An application authorization filter is a single group in Grouper containing individuals who are authorized to access the application. Policy Note: Newly integrated or updated applications with HarvardKey are required to use an Application Authorization Filter unless an exception is granted by IAM. The Grouper group name is included in an application’s HarvardKey registration. After HarvardKey authenticates a user, it checks to see if the person is in the Grouper group. If they are in the group, then HarvardKey passes the user onto the application, where the application itself may have additional authorization in place. If they are not in the group, then HarvardKey issues a Sign In error message ""User is not assigned to this application."" Application owners may request that HarvardKey directs users to an alternate error page hosted by the application. Types of Application Authorization Filters Each application integrated with HarvardKey has only one Application Authorization Filter which can be either a generic authorization filter, or an application-specific authorization filter. Generic Authorization Filters General purpose groups that can be used by multiple applications for authorization. May include affiliations across the university that align with affiliation and assurance tiers, or be specific to a school or unit. Auto-updated daily from an authoritative source of data, because they are populated using Grouper reference groups. Can be viewed by Grouper users in the harvard:apps:hkey-authz folder. Can be viewed by others on the IAM site - HarvardKey Generic Authorization Filters Additional generic filters may be requested by application owners by emailing iam_help@harvard.edu Application-specific Authorization Filters Contains people that are to access a specific application. Resides in a school or department’s apps folder in the harvard:org structure. Can only be viewed by the school/departments delegated group administrators or group membership managers. Appropriate to use when a generic filter cannot be used, such as when: Access is limited to a custom list of people Access requires people added individually by name, in addition to reference groups Access is a mix of specific schools and departments across the university Created by Grouper delegated group administrators, or with assistance from IAM, according to a documented convention. Request assistance by emailing iam_help@harvard.edu See Understand application-specific authorization filters in Grouper for more details. Optional Group MemberOf Attribute Release An Application may request the Group MemberOf Attribute Release in their HarvardKey Application Integration Registration Form. Provides a person’s group membership information via the CAS/SAML assertion response when they log into the application. Usually used by the application to assign finer grain authorization (e.g., admin permissions). Never returns all the Grouper groups a person is a member of. Is limited to the groups in a specific folder, usually the folder where the Application-specific authorization filter is. Suggested convention is to start the group with “role-”.

It contains links to Grouper knowledge articles (KBs) on the IT Help Portal that guide you on how to become proficient with the basic Grouper features. After completing the training you are eligible to become a delegated group administrator for your school or department by Requesting access to Grouper. There are two parts to the training: Create and administer managed Grouper groups (covering in this KB) Create application authorization filters in Grouper It is expected that you fully read each linked knowledge article and follow the tasks below in sequence to progress logically through your training. Access Grouper Email iam_help@harvard.edu and request access to Grouper for training purposes. You will be granted access to Grouper for 3 months in the harvard:training:practice folder where you will perform the steps in this guide. Important! Your access to the Grouper platform requires that you understand the Harvard Information Security Policy as level 3 data is visible within the application. Navigate folders and groups Read Understanding different Grouper group types. Log into Grouper Use the Navigate groups and folders in Grouper KB to explore the groups that you are able to see and to perform the next tasks. Navigate to a folder and view its information. Navigate to a reference group and view its information. Click on a person in the reference group to view their Information. Find a reference group that has over 50 people and navigate to the last page of members. Search for yourself using your HUID Search for HUIT reference groups by typing “ref: huit” in the search box. Note the space between ref: and huit. Create and edit a folder Use the Create, edit, delete groups and folders in Grouper KB for instructions on how to perform the following tasks: Navigate to the harvard:training:practice folder. Create a new folder in the harvard:training:practice folder. Name it using your first name, followed by a dash, and your last name, in all lowercase. Give it a description. Edit the folder Change the Folder name to your first name, followed by a space, and your last name, using initial capital letters. This is a more readable display name for the folder. The same thing can be done for groups. Modify the description to include today’s date, in any format. Show details about the folder. Create another folder within your training folder, and then delete it. Create a managed group A managed group is a custom, or ad hoc, group created as necessary by delegated group administrators for a particular purpose. Use these KBs for instructions on how to perform the following tasks: Create, edit, delete groups and folders in Grouper Add and remove people in Grouper groups Add and remove people in bulk to Grouper groups using import Navigate to your harvard:training:practice folder. Create a folder called “managed” within your training folder, with the description “Folder for the creation of managed groups pertaining to (your name).” Note - by convention we create managed groups in a folder called “managed” Create a group called “members-my-team” within your managed folder, with the description “A group containing members of my team, before removing inactive members.” Add yourself to the group, plus some of your colleagues, and several people outside of your organization. Add them to your group using their name, email or HUID. Show and then hide details about your group. Import additional members to your group using a list of HUIDs or NetIDs, or a .csv file containing them. Create another group within your managed folder, and then delete it. Add people from another group to your group Use the Add and remove people in Grouper groups KB for instructions on how to perform the following tasks: Navigate to your “members-my-team” managed group. Add the reference group “HUIT Employees” by entering “ref: huit employees” in the Member name or ID: field and select “harvard:ref:affiliations:ca:huit:employees:HUIT Employees” from the list. Note the space after ref: and huit in your entry. This will add approx. 700+ indirect members to your group. Scroll to the bottom of the member list to see how many people are in the group. Search for yourself in the group. Filter for direct members of the group. Remove one of your colleagues from the group. Remove the HUIT Employees reference group from the group. Create a composite group If a managed group contains people listed by name, you want to ensure that the managed group is automatically updated whenever the affiliation of a person in the group becomes inactive. To do this, create a composite group which intersects the “members-” group with either a reference or a bundled group. The resultant membership of the composite group are individuals who exist in both groups, and since reference and bundled group only contain members with a current affiliation (e.g. student), once anyone in the “members-” group becomes non-current (e.g. they graduate) they will automatically be removed from the composite group. Use the Create composite groups in Grouper KB for instructions on how to perform the following tasks: Create a group called “my-team” within your managed folder, with the description “A group containing members of my team, after removing inactive members.” Create a composite group using the intersection operation: Select your “members-my-team” group as the first factor. Select a reference group that contains employees in your school or organization for the second factor (e.g. harvard:ref:affiliations:ca:huit:employees:HUIT Employees). View the first and second factors, and the membership of the composite group. Compare the members of your “my-team” composite group to the original list of members in your “members-my-team” group. Note: you can duplicate the grouper tab on your browser to make this side by side comparison easier. Notice that in your “my-team” composite group that any members that were not also a member of your second factor reference group have been removed. Edit the composite group and change the second factor to a reference group that has either a broader or smaller population Compare the memberships again of your “my-team” and “members-my-team” groups. Remove the composite on the group. What's next Join the IAM Group Services Announcement List View the Getting Started with Grouper KB and browse the list of other Grouper Knowledge Articles.

IT Provider Services,Guide to create application authorization filters in Grouper,"These instructions are for school/department Delegated Group Administrators who are looking to create and manage application authorization filters in Grouper for their applications that use HarvardKey. Conventions The instructions below follow the IAM conventions to use when creating authorization filters. Please follow these conventions unless your application has requirements that warrant a customized setup. IAM is available for consultation or to review your application authorization filter. Send requests to iam_help@harvard.edu Create an application folder Navigate to your school or department's apps folder in Grouper. If none exists then create a folder called “apps” in your school/department’s folder in the “harvard:org” hierarchy. By convention all application authorization filters should be in your apps folder. Create the application-specific folder. Use the application name as the folder name and ID, according to the following Grouper naming convention: All lowercase alphanumeric characters. Separate application words with a hyphen (e.g. survey-tool). Do not use spaces or any other special characters. Use the following description for the application folder. Omit the brackets and substitute your application’s information. A folder containing authorization filter groups for the [my-app] application. Contact is [app contact name]. [ServiceNow INC Ticket #] Note: the ServiceNow INC ticket number is usually the ticket used to request the application registration and has the HarvardKey Application Registration attached. Create the application authorization filter groups Use the naming conventions, composite requirements and sample descriptions in these instructions when creating the application authorization filter groups. Substitute your application name for [my-app] and omit the brackets. See Understand application-specific authorization filters in Grouper for more information about these groups. In the application folder create the members-users group. Name it members-users-[my-app] Use the description: People who are intended to access the [my-app] application, before removing any inactive or excluded users. This is the group that application owners will edit in Grouper in order to add/remove people from their final authorized-users group filter. It will be used later in the eligible-users group. In the members-users-[my-app] group add people, and/or IAM reference, bundle or other managed groups containing the user population intended to access the application. In the application folder create the eligible-users group. Name it eligible-users-[my-app] Use the description: People who are intended to access the [my-app] application, after removing any inactive users. It will be used later in the authorized-users group. Make the eligible-users-[my-app] group a composite intersection group. Use the members-users-[my-app] group as the First factor group. Select the “and (intersection)” operation. For the Second factor group, select an appropriate reference or bundle group that contains a superset of the population intended to access the application. Since reference and bundle groups contain only those with an active Harvard affiliation, intersecting the members-users-[my-app] group with them ensures that only those with an active Harvard affiliation will remain in the eligible-users-[my-app] group. In the application folder create the authorized-users group. Name it authorized-users-[my-app] Use the description: People who are intended to access the [my-app] application, after removing any inactive or excluded users. This is the final group of people who are authorized to access the application and is considered the application authorization filter. It is used in the application’s HarvardKey registration to control access via the HarvardKey group authorization service. Make the authorized-users-[my-app] group a composite complement group. Use the eligible-users-[my-app] as the First factor group. Select the “not (complement) (minus)” operation. For the Second factor group, enter the university excluded users group “etc:excluded-users”. This composite removes access for persons as determined by the HUIT Information Security and Data Privacy Office which is required by policy for all application authorization filters. When submitting your HarvardKey Application Integration Registration Form. Include the full ID path of the authorized-users-[my-app] group in the User Authorization section. Create an optional excluded users group if needed If you require excluding specific individuals or groups from accessing an application, then create an excluded users group that is specific to the application as instructed below. In the application folder create an excluded-users group. Name it excluded-users-[my-app] Use the description: People who are excluded from accessing the [my-app] application. As per IAM policy, this group should include the university excluded users group. Add the university excluded users group “etc:excluded-users” as a member of the excluded-users-my-app group. Add any other people or groups who should be excluded from accessing the application as members of the excluded-users-my-app group. Edit the composite in the authorized-users-[my-app] group. For the Second factor group, replace the university excluded users group with the excluded-users-my-app group.

Each group is a rollup of all individuals within the department and any of its sub-departments. Includes only those with an active Harvard Employee or Sponsored Role affiliation. Dynamically updated daily from an authoritative source of data. Partitioned into top level folders for each school/unit, such as CADM, FAS, HLS, etc. School/unit folders also have a rollup group for each Employee Classification and most Harvard Sponsored Role types. Used as building blocks for inclusion in other groups, providing group owners flexibility in defining their group populations. Browse department reference groups Navigate to the harvard:ref:dept folder using the navigation pane, and click on it to bring it up in the main window. See Navigate groups and folders in Grouper if you are unfamiliar with how to generally navigate within Grouper. Click the employees folder to browse the employee department reference groups. Click the sponsored folder to browse the Harvard Sponsored Roles department reference groups. Beneath the employee and sponsored folders are folders for each of the top level schools/units, such as CADM, FAS, and HLS. Click on the school/unit folder to view all the department reference groups for that school/unit. In the employees folder, each school/unit folder also has an empl-class folder. Click on it to view groups containing a rollup of all active employees in that school/unit for each HR employee classification, such as Admin & Professional, Support Staff, and Senior Faculty. In the sponsored folder, each school/unit folder also has a role-type folder. Click on it to view groups containing a rollup of all people in that tub that have an active Harvard Sponsored Role for most Sponsored Role role types, such as Consultant, Contingent Worker and Collaborator. Department reference group naming conventions Employee department reference group names begin with EMPL- Harvard Sponsored Role department reference group names begin with HSR- Following EMPL- or HSR- is the school/unit acronym, such as CADM, FAS, or HLS, followed by an underscore character (e.g., EMPL-HLS_, or HSR-HLS_). Following the school/unit acronym is the short version of the HR department name followed by a dash and then the department ID (e.g., EMPL-HLS_Clinical Prog-100593). The long version of the HR department name, which is more descriptive, is included in the reference group description. For sub-departments, any parent departments in the HR department hierarchy are part of the group name, separated by an underscore character (e.g., EMPL-HLS_Clinical Prog_Clinical Prog Admin-100592). In this example the “Clinical Prog Admin” department is a sub-department of “Clinical Prog”. This convention informs the user as to where the sub-department exists within the HR hierarchy. Search department reference groups Use the Grouper search bar to search for department reference groups using a variety of methods: By Partial Department Name: Limit your search to just the department reference groups by entering ref:dept: followed by a space, and then enter all or part of the department name, such as “ref:dept: campus services”. (Note: folders in Grouper are separated by colons.) In this example the search will return all department reference groups containing the words campus or services in their name or description. Further limit to just departments in a specific tub by adding the tub folder followed by a colon and a space to the search criteria, such as “ref:dept: CADM: campus services”. By Full Department Name: Cut and paste the department specified in various Harvard sources, such as the Harvard Web Directory, into the Grouper search bar (e.g., CADM^HUIT^TPS^IAM) Since descriptions of department reference groups contain the department short and long names, including the carat characters, these groups are returned in the search results. The search will return both the employee and the Harvard Sponsored role department reference groups. By Department ID: Quickly find a single department’s reference groups by entering the six character department ID (e.g., 100593).

IT Provider Services,Request a dynamic Grouper group for use in M365 SharePoint access,"These instructions are for SharePoint users who are looking to use dynamic Grouper groups to manage access to SharePoint. Dynamic Grouper groups contain reference and bundle groups that are updated daily based on current affiliation information from systems of record, helping departments automate changes to access privileges as a person’s role changes over time. Some examples of dynamic groups are all employees in a specific department, all faculty and students in a specific school, or all paid employees across the University. As individuals are added to a group (e.g., a new employee in a department) they gain access to all resources granted to that group. Similarly as individuals leave a group (e.g., an employee is terminated or transfers), access is removed from resources granted to that group. These dynamic groups are selectable in SharePoint and may be used to control access to sites, folders, and files. The group names begin with DYN and as such are easily searchable in the M365 people picker (e.g. DYN All Admin and Professional Employees). Any Dynamic group is visible and selectable by any M365 user. See ""Grant SharePoint access to a dynamic group"" KB for instructions. Before submitting a request Look to see if there is an existing dynamic group in M365 SharePoint that meets your needs. Review available reference and bundle groups in Grouper, to see if they meet your population criteria. Check with your local Grouper administrators to find out who has current access to Grouper. Consider your group’s size. Requested groups should contain 10 or more individuals. To submit a request Use this request form to request a Grouper group for use in M365 SharePoint access. The request requires the following information: School / Business Unit Department How do you plan to use the group(s)? What specific populations would you like included (e.g. students, class participants, employees, faculty, staff, Harvard Sponsored Roles, alumni)? What specific schools or departments is the population limited to, if any? Are there existing reference or bundle groups in Grouper that meet your population needs? If Yes, please note the reference or bundle groups. Do you have a deadline to have the group(s) in place (e.g., launch date for new site)? After submitting your request you will be given an estimate for the creation of the new dynamic group(s).

IT Provider Services,Getting Started with Change Management at HUIT,"QUESTION: What is Change Management? ANSWER: HUIT, like any IT organization, has to make changes to its applications and infrastructure. Change Management reduces the risk of those changes by creating standardized methods and procedures that are effective (ensuring the necessary analysis, planning, coordination, testing and documentation to reduce risk) as well as efficient (provide the necessary benefit as quickly and simply as possible). Objectives: Establish a standard change management process and tool for all HUIT changes Ensure that approvals are aligned with risk level Support successful internal and external communications Capture metrics and lessons learned to continuously improve the Change Management process Scope: Change Management begins when the need for the change is identified, not when it is ready to be implemented. Requesting review and approval of changes early provides for: Better visibility, prioritization and planning More realistic impact analysis and resource allocation Reduced delays and rework Improved communication For more information, see KB0012679 ""HUIT Change Management: What does ""scope"" mean?"" Roles and Responsibilities: There are three main roles: the Change Requestor, Change Implementer, and Assignment Group Approver. The Change Requestor is the person submitting and owning the Change Request, the Change Implementer/Assignee implements and monitors the change, and the manager (or designee) of the functional group implements the change. For more information, see KB0012680 ""HUIT Change Management: What are the roles and responsibilities of those in change management?"" Change Types There are four different change types, each with different criteria and requirements. They are as follows: Pre-Approved (Standard) Normal Emergency Major For more information see KB0012681 ""HUIT Change Management: What are the different change types?"" Change Request Key Components The key components that make up a change request are lifecycle, planning, and the implementation rating. Lifecycle is the full process that is done in order to complete a change request ticket. Planning is a key component before beginning the lifecycle process that evaluates the potential impact of the ticket. The implementation rating is an evaluation of the success of the change after it is done. For more information, see KB0012682 ""HUIT Change Management: What are the key components of a change request ticket?"" Change Freeze and Term Startup Exception Guidelines During term startup change freeze, no significant changes to critical services or major project deployments should be scheduled. Exceptions are permitted with approval from at least three of five operational Managing Directors. For more information on Change Freeze Periods, see KB0010641 (public) ""HUIT Change Management: When is Change ""Freeze""?"" For more information on Exception Guidelines and services considered critical to term start up, see KB0013586 (internal) ""HUIT Change Management: What are Change Freeze and Term Startup Exception Guidelines?"" Business Events & Maintenance Windows In addition to Change Freeze, HUIT teams are encouraged to exercise Heightened Sensitivity when implementing changes during semester Reading and Exam Periods, and Commencement activities in May. HUIT observes four Major Maintenance Windows to perform necessary updates to Harvard’s IT systems, times when we expect IT services may not be available. Unless noted otherwise, these time frames apply to all services: Change Freeze Periods Heightened Sensitivity Major Maintenance Fall Startup (4 weeks) Reading & Exam Periods Severity 3 (6-hour Window) Spring & Summer Startup (2 weeks) Commencement Severity 2 (12-hour Window) Severity 1 (18-hour Window) For more information on HUIT's Major Maintenance Windows, see KB0013877 (internal) ""HUIT Change Management: When are HUIT's Maintenance Windows?""

IT Provider Services,Format fonts and images in knowledge articles,"This guide is for anyone authorized to edit articles in the HUIT Knowledge Base. For a full guide detailing spelling, abbreviations, and preferred terminology, see the HUIT Style Guide on the HUIT Intranet. Format text Always apply a template by selecting an Article Type. This automatically adds the sections you'll need, in the correct styles. If you need to add additional sections with headings, follow these guidelines: Do not use Heading 1; it is reserved for the short description (article title). Use Heading 2 for top-level headers (e.g. ""Getting started""). Use Heading 3 and subsequent headings for next level headers (i.e. subsections). The short description field is your title. Don't replicate the short description in the article body. Write the short description in Sentence case. Capitalize the first word, and any proper nouns. Use the default font. In the editor, don't change the Font Family or Font Sizes. Your entire article should be set as ""Paragraph,"" except for any headings. Use the default font color. Don't add color to the text or its background. Use B (bold) text when describing interactions in instructions, like button titles or tabs to click. Don't copy content directly into the article body from another website or word processing software. Instead, first copy it into a plain text editor and then copy and paste it from the text editor into the article body. This will clear all unintended formatting.

IT Provider Services,How to add groups and permissions to Azure AD on the Soliant FileMaker Servers,"Azure AD user authentication can be added to FileMaker databases hosted on the Soliant servers. This allows authorized users to login to their FileMaker databases using their Harvard Key email address and password. How it Works HUIT and Soliant Consulting register each FileMaker Server with the Harvard University Azure AD system. After this work has been done, users can add the Azure AD user groups and access rights to each of their databases. The conversion from FileMaker user accounts to Harvard Key accounts is usually done in several steps. A department's FileMaker admins add the appropriate Azure user groups and permissions to each database, as described in this document. In conjunction with HUIT and Soliant Consulting, the Azure group access is tested. When all testing is completed for all users of the FileMaker server, Azure AD logins to the FileMaker databases is enabled. Preparation for Azure AD Authentication The first step in preparing for the Azure AD integration is to decide which users should have what level of access to each of your databases. For each of your database files, please prepare up to three lists of users: • Admin Full Access Required Can modify the databases, select users and privileges. Full read-write access to data • Read/Write Optional Full read-write access to the data. • Read-Only Optional Can open the database and can read the data. If any of your FileMaker databases require different sets of users and permissions, you will need to prepare the user lists for each database file. Maintenance of Users and Privileges From time-to-time you may need to add or remove users from your FileMaker databases' user groups. To do this, submit a ticket to HUIT. Add Azure AD to FileMaker Databases The following steps need to be done to every FileMaker database your group uses. The process is not complicated, but it needs to be done carefully. Requirement: The person making the changes must have [Full Access] privileges to the FileMaker database being changed. If there are no known Full Access users for your database, Soliant Consulting may be able to help. STEP 1: THE MANAGE SECURITY WINDOW Using FileMaker Pro, open your FileMaker database file. Select File > Manage > Security When the Manage Security opens, make sure the [Guest] and the Admin account are both unchecked. Next, click on the Authenticate via menu. Choose Microsoft Azure AD STEP 2: ADD THE AZURE AD GROUPS AND PRIVILEGES In the FileMaker Manage Microsoft Azure AD view, you will add one Azure AD User Group at a time for each of your databases. HUIT will give you • an Azure AD User Group Name (for example: HUIT-FileMaker-mygroup-ReadWrite-dgs) • an Azure AD User Group ID (for example: f7716a6e-1fb1-4e80-b680-a444-2b) You will need to add this information to your databases. Press the [+New] button to add a new User Group and privileges. Enter data in the right side of the window as shown above. Click [x] Group and [x] Active. Put the Group ID you are given into the Group Name (Object ID) field. Put the Group Name into the Description field. Set the Privilege Set field to the correct privileges for that group Press [OK] when finished. Repeat these three steps for each User Group to be added to this database. After each User Group has been added, continue to STEP 3 on the next page for this database. STEP 3: MAKE ""FILE OPTIONS"" CHANGES Now, open the File Options window. File > File Options Uncheck the ""Log in using"" and the ""Show sign-in fields"" boxes. Other fields do not need to be changed. When complete, press [OK]. STEP 4: NOW REPEAT FOR EACH DATABASE FILE This completes the changes for this particular FileMaker database file. Repeat STEP 1 through STEP 4 for each of your FileMaker database files. Login to a FileMaker Database with Azure AD Authentication When the FileMaker Server and your FileMaker databases have been configured to use Azure AD authentication, the normal FileMaker login window will change.

IT Provider Services,Understand application-specific authorization filters in Grouper,"This information is for Delegated Group Administrators who are looking to create an application authorization filter in Grouper that is specific to their application. Application authorization filters An application-specific authorization filter is a single group in Grouper containing individuals who are authorized to access a specific web application using HarvardKey. Any web application using the HarvardKey group authorization service will have either an application-specific authorization filter or use a HarvardKey generic authorization filter which multiple applications can use. The name of the authorization filter group in Grouper is used in the HarvardKey registration for the application. Simply put, if a person is a member of the application-specific authorization filter, or the generic authorization filter group, then HarvardKey will grant them access to the application when they log in using their HarvardKey. Application-specific authorization filter Grouper delegated administrators may create their own application-specific authorization filters in Grouper following the Guide to Setup Application Authorization Groups in Grouper, and IAM can assist as needed by emailing iam_help@harvard.edu Application-specific authorization filter groups As per IAM convention, the Authorized User group is a final resultant group which is derived from three other application authorization groups within Grouper. The following explains the set of Application Authorization Groups and how they are used to derive the final Authorized Users group. Members Users Group – this group contains the raw list of people, and/or IAM reference, bundle or other managed groups who are the intended users of the application, before removing any inactive and excluded users. This is the group that application owners will edit in Grouper in order to add/remove people from their final Authorized Users group. It will be used by the Eligible Users group. The form of the Members Users group name is “members-users-”. Eligible Users Group – this group is created as a Grouper composite group which intersects the Members Users group with an IAM Reference group. The result is a group with only members that have an active Harvard affiliation, as defined by the Reference Group that is used in the composite (e.g. All Employees). Any people listed in the Members Users group whose Harvard affiliation ends will automatically be removed from the Eligible Users group when the Reference group is updated daily from the IAM Identity Registry. The Eligible Users group is not normally edited by the application owner, unless the intersecting Reference group needs to be changed. It will be used in the final Authorized User group. The form of the Eligible Users group name is “eligible-users-”. Excluded Users Group – this group contains a list of people who are excluded from accessing the application. The membership list includes the University Excluded Users group which enables immediate termination of access to all applications for persons as determined by the security office. This Excluded Users group is rarely edited by the application owner unless extenuating circumstances warrants adding someone to immediately prohibit their access to the application. It will be used in the final Authorized User group. The form of the Excluded Users group name is “excluded-users-”. Authorized Users Group – this is the final group of people who are authorized to access the application. It is created as a Grouper composite group which subtracts the Excluded Users group from the Eligible Users group. The Authorized Users group should not be edited by the application owner since it is resultant group derived from the other three application authorization groups described above. It is used by the HarvardKey AuthorizationFilterAttribute option for controlling access to applications through the HarvardKey group authorization service. The form of the Authorized Users group name is “authorized-users-”. Application-specific authorization filter location in Grouper As per IAM convention, all of the application authorization filter groups for a specific application, including the Authorized Users group, should exist in an application-specific folder in Grouper which is named for the application. Since a school or department may be responsible for multiple applications, all their application folders should exist beneath a folder named ""apps"" which exists somewhere beneath their school or department folder hierarchy in Grouper.

IT Provider Services,Create a CSV file of members of a Grouper group using export,"These instructions are for Delegated Group Administrators or Group Membership Managers who are looking to create a .csv file of all members of a Grouper group. This can be useful in comparing Grouper group memberships to group lists in other systems. Export members of a Grouper group into a .csv file Navigate to or search for your group in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. Click the Group actions button and select Export members from the dropdown. In the What data would you like to export option, select All member data. Click the Export button. Grouper will export the group membership into a .csv file called “groupExportAll_” followed by your group name. Clean-up the .csv file to just members of the group These instructions are for Microsoft Excel, but other spreadsheet tools could also be used. Open the .csv file that was created by the Grouper export in Microsoft Excel. If your group contains other groups in its membership, then the group names will be included in the export. These groups will list first in the spreadsheet and the first column will have g:gsa as the sourceID. Delete these rows if any exist. Delete all columns except column E, which has the heading “description”. Delete the first row, which has the column heading. All that should remain is a list of people in the group, one per row, and each row has a person’s data as it exists in Grouper (e.g. name, HUID, NetID, email) Name:, is a person’s “preferred name”, and Email: is a person’s “official email” as identified in the IAM Identity Registry. Convert the member data into separate columns in the .csv file Select the column that has all the member data, which would be column A if the above instructions were followed. In Excel, select Data on the menu ribbon to display the Excel data features. In the Data Tools section select Text to Columns to bring up the Convert Text to Columns Wizard. In the option “Choose the file type that best describes your data:” keep Delimited selected, and then click Next. In the “Delimiters” section check the Space box. In the ""Data Preview"" window you should see a sampling of how the data will be separated into columns. Click the Finish button, and each row of member data should now be separated into multiple columns. Check the list of members to make sure all data is aligned in the right columns. If a person has a double first or last name separated by a space (e.g. Lisa Smith Gomez) then their data will be misaligned in the columns. Manually fix these so all member data is aligned. Important Security Considerations Delete any columns that are not required for your data needs such as EPPN or HUID. A person’s HUID is considered level 3 data and should only be kept in the .csv file if absolutely necessary. If the .csv file has both the name and HUID of people in the group you must send it securely over email.

IT Provider Services,Create composite groups in Grouper,"These instructions are for Delegated Group Administrators who are looking to create composite groups in the Grouper application. Composite groups either intersect the memberships of two groups to ensure members exist in both groups, or composite groups complement two groups to remove members in one group who do not exist in another. Uses: By intersecting the membership of a managed group with a reference or bundle group, the composite group will contain only members of the managed group that have a current Harvard affiliation. A composite complement group is used to exclude the University exclude users group, which by policy must be removed from any application authorization filter to prevent unwanted access to applications. Create a composite intersection group Navigate to or search for your folder in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. Create a group that will be the composite group. By convention, the managed group used in the first factor begins with “members-” and the composite group uses the same name without the prepended “members-” (e.g. members-my-group is the managed group, and my-group is the composite group). From the Group actions drop-down menu, select Edit composite. In the Composite option select Yes to open the composite selections. For the First factor group enter the name of the managed group that will be used in the intersection. By convention, this will be a group that starts with “members-” (e.g. members-my-group). In the Operation option select “and (intersection)” from the dropdown. Intersection means the resultant members of the composite group will be those who are in both the first and second factor groups, also referred to as an “and” function. For the Second factor group enter the name of another managed group, a reference group, or bundle group that will be used in the intersection. Intersecting with a reference or bundle group ensures the resultant composite group will contain only members of the managed group that have a current Harvard affiliation. Click the Save button to create the composite group and display it in the main window. Create a composite complement (minus) group Navigate to or search for your folder in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. Create a group that will be the composite group. From the Group actions drop-down menu, select Edit composite. In the Composite option select Yes to open the composite selections. For the First factor group enter the name of the managed group that will have members removed if they are not in the second factor group. In the Operation option select “not (complement) (minus)” from the dropdown. Complement or Minus means members are in the first factor group but not in the second factor group, also referred to as a “not” function. Complement is usually used for exclude lists, particularly in the construction of an application authorization filter to prevent unwanted access to applications. For the Second factor group enter the name of another managed group, a reference group, or bundle group that will be used in complement. Click the Save button to create the composite group and display it in the main window. View factors and membership of a composite group The First and Second factor groups, and the Operation of the composite group, are shown as a Note on the Members tab. Click on either the First or Second factor group to be taken to that group in Grouper. Use your browser’s back arrow to return to the composite group. The members of the composite group are listed under Entity name, the same as non-composite groups. However, these members are a result of either intersecting two groups, or subtracting one group from another. Note that you cannot add members directly to a composite group. All members have an Indirect Membership to the composite group because they are the result of performing an operation on two other groups. Edit a composite group Navigate to or search for your composite group in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. From the Group actions drop-down menu, select Edit composite. Change the First or Second factor groups, or the Operation. Click the Save button to apply the edits and display it in the main window. To edit the composite group name, ID or description, simply edit the group as you would any other group in Grouper. Members of a composite group cannot be deleted because they have an Indirect Membership in the composite group. If they are removed from the First Factor group however, they will be automatically removed from the composite group. Remove the composite on a group Navigate to or search for your composite group in Grouper and bring it up in the main window. From the Group actions drop-down menu, select Edit composite. In the Composite option select No. Click the Save button to remove the composite. Members can now be added directly to the group.

Teaching & Learning,In-depth Guide: use Zoom to teach online,"Introduction Prepare for your Zoom session Get started Schedule your class sessions Plan roles for students: don't host alone Encourage a sense of community Prepare for technical issues Create an agenda Record your session Engage students: chat, screen annotation, polling, non-verbal feedback, and breakout rooms Chat Screen annotation Polling Verbal and non-verbal feedback Breakout rooms Deliver accessible online class sessions Dive into specific teaching scenarios Host office hours or small group discussions Pre-record a video Write on the board Host an interactive review session Introduction As an instructor, Zoom helps keep your class going if you can't meeting in person. Synchronous online class sessions, where everyone joins a Zoom meeting at a scheduled time, is one way to create engagement when students are remote. Zoom can also support other teaching and learning scenarios. Zoom can be used on laptops, desktops, tablets, smartphones, and even desk phones, giving students many ways to access the class session. Prepare for your Zoom session Zoom was designed to be mostly intuitive. Still, it works best if you make some key decisions and become familiar with the platform before inviting students into an online meeting. Get started Install the software: The desktop version of Zoom will give you the best results and functionality when hosting a meeting. Coach your students to install it as well. Students who plan to join Zoom meetings from a mobile device should also download the Zoom mobile app. Learn more about Zoom: Get to know your host controls Read up on running a smooth meeting in Zoom Sign up for training (offered by Zoom) Test your audio and video Visit zoom.us/test to check your internet connection, audio, and video. Do you need a headset? Which camera angle is best? If multiple meeting attendees are in the same physical space, in order to avoid feedback only one person should join the meeting with audio. Find your light! Make sure there is a light source (including windows) in front of you, not behind. Schedule your class sessions You can schedule Zoom meetings in a few different ways. Zoom can be enabled in your Canvas course navigation, which will be the easiest place for your students to find your meetings. You can schedule a Zoom meeting in your Canvas course and choose recurring meetings when appropriate. This way the URL will remain the same throughout the course. Remember to give your meetings a meaningful name! If you schedule from within Canvas: Course meetings appear to students within the Canvas course site Course meeting also appear to class participants as events in the Canvas Calendar Cloud recordings of meetings can be made available through the Canvas course site You can separate course meetings from other meetings Notes: By default, the meeting host is the only one who can view and edit details about a meeting. If the host assigns scheduling privileges to another person, that person will then be able to edit and schedule meetings on the host’s behalf. Only use your personal meeting ID and personal Zoom URL for unscheduled meetings. These meetings won't be available in Canvas as mentioned above and cannot be co-hosted. If your course cannot use Zoom from within Canvas, you can schedule meetings in the Zoom web portal (harvard.zoom.us) or desktop app (and share the join link with your students) or add Zoom to an Outlook meeting. Already have meetings scheduled within your web portal that you need to add to Canvas? You can import Zoom meetings into your Canvas course. Requiring your participants to register before joining the meeting will ensure that you will be able to download a list of participants once your meeting has concluded. Plan roles for students: don't host alone You’ll have a less stressful classroom management experience if you deputize someone else to manage aspects of the online space. By default, your TAs and any other teaching staff will be automatically added as alternative hosts for your meetings, and you can also add co-hosts during your meeting. Consider asking a TA or student to monitor the chat and another to help their peers with technology issues. That way, you can focus on teaching, and you’ll give students some extra digital skills practice. Encourage a sense of community The sense of presence will be enhanced when everyone shows their face via their webcam. Consider requiring students to turn on video as a key part of participation, since it is easier to engage with the class if you can see them. Students are more likely to pay attention if they know they’re on camera. Also, coach students on how to toggle to the Gallery view (this is the “Brady Bunch” view where everyone is visible to each other at the same time). Tips to share with your students: Make eye contact with the camera (the camera is the class!) Mute mics when you’re not contributing Find your light! Make sure there is a light source in front of you, not behind Speak in a conversational tone - you won’t need to raise your voice Headsets or earbuds can be very useful to improve sound quality For more tips, read up on running a smooth meeting in Zoom Prepare for technical issues Host a low-stakes introductory online meeting, with the sole purpose of having everyone log in, troubleshoot technical issues, and get used to the Zoom interface. Arrive early enough to work out technical difficulties. Have a backup plan in case of unexpected issues or difficulties (i.e. phone conference, using Canvas to facilitate the class, group discussions, or independent learning activities.). Inform students of the backup plan ahead of time so they can remain on task if technical issues occur. If using slideware, review how to share your screen with your PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides presentation. If you are using Google Slides Speaker Notes, your notes will open in a new window that is not shared with the Zoom participants. However, meeting participants will be able to see your browser URL and your open tabs. Create an agenda Plan for a synchronous online course session just like you would plan for an in-person class. Share your agenda with students ahead of time so students have a clear idea of how the class will progress, what will be covered, and the activities they’ll engage in. Periodically cover online etiquette and expectations of the students, or consider providing a ""best practices"" document that outlines the expectations. Record your session In the case that someone has a technical issue, you may want to offer them future access to the class material. To address this, you can record the class session. Record to the Cloud, rather than on your computer: It's convenient to record to the cloud, as you can receive both a URL to the video and an interactive transcript. There is no storage quota on Zoom recordings, and recordings of meetings scheduled via Zoom in Canvas appear within a few hours. Start recording in the right layout: The recording layout is based on your view when you begin recording. Therefore, remember to share presentations before recording, and switch to the active speaker view rather than the gallery view (or don't use your webcam at all), otherwise the video of you will be superimposed over the top right corner in the recording. Notes: If you set your meetings to record automatically, make sure to uncheck the ""Enable join before host"" option in your meeting's settings. This will ensure no students join early and start the recording from their screen. Let students know you're going to record the session. Offer students the option to mute their audio and/or turn off their video during the recording. If meetings are recorded to the cloud and you are using the Canvas integration, you can find the recordings right in Canvas. These recordings may be subject to different retention policies than other class session recordings. Contact your local academic technology support for additional guidance on where to store the recordings and how to display them to your class. Engage students You can use the features of Zoom to guide different types of interactive activities. These activities offer variety to break up a long class session, and they offer different means of expression. Chat Using the chat tool can encourage engagement by allowing more students to interact with the live activity, rather than just listening. There are even advantages of Chat over the traditional classroom: Get large numbers of responses to a question immediately, and use these responses in real-time or archive them for later. See exactly where students are on a particular issue or debate, informing who to call on next. Think about how, when, and where you want to allow students to engage in chat. For example, are you comfortable with comments in Chat throughout the class, or only at particular moments? If you have a TA who can filter comments, you might allow students to use Chat continuously; if you don’t, you might encourage its use at discrete times. Notes: Chat allows posts to the whole class or to one other person. You can download the full chat history at the end of class if you want to keep a record. Chat can be overwhelming for some students. It is recommended you offer this type of interaction as an option, but do not require it for all students. Chat can also be overwhelming for you to monitor while you’re also trying to teach. Have a student or TA to monitor the chat so you can focus on teaching. Screen annotation Zoom has basic annotation tools (text box, free form draw/pen, shapes, and highlighter) that you can use to guide students or explain a concept. Access these tools by selecting the Annotate option when you're sharing your screen. Note: Screen annotations are not accessible for screen reader users. If you use this feature, be sure to use accessible presentation best practices: say what you're doing while you're doing it, e.g., ""I'm drawing a big red circle around the login button on this web page."" Polling Set up polls in advance and launch them during your class session. Non-verbal and verbal feedback Activate the non-verbal feedback feature for your meetings to allow students to communicate with the teaching staff without interrupting the meeting. Routinely check in with students to address any non-verbal feedback. This feature also allows you to manage verbal feedback, as you can instruct students to use the ""raise hand"" feature to indicate when they'd like to speak. Remember to keep the students muted until you call on them to avoid extraneous background noise. Breakout rooms You can use Zoom’s breakout rooms functionality to have students do group work. As the instructor, you can join breakout rooms, broadcast messages to the breakout rooms, and end the breakout sessions when it is time to regroup. Self-select option for breakout rooms: hosts can create breakout rooms with the option for participants to self-select which breakout room they would like to join. If enabled, participants can move freely between breakout rooms, without needing the host’s help. Deliver accessible online class sessions If you have someone designated to take notes (an accessibility best practice), you can enable closed captions and live transcription. Live transcription transcribes the meeting automatically and allows real-time viewing of the full transcript in the in-meeting side panel. You can even use closed captioning in breakout rooms. If you require live captioning beyond what's provided through the live transcription feature, Zoom easily integrates with providers such as 3Play Media. Note: the cost of this service is not covered centrally. All students may not see or make sense of the visual display as you intend. Get in the habit of describing whatever is happening visually on the screen. Dive into specific teaching scenarios Host office hours or small group discussions Code review: You can use screen sharing to meet with an individual or group of students to review code. Authorizing remote screen control enables one to take control of the other's shared application and allows for navigation, text entry, etc on the remote computer. Note that when remote screen control is enabled, your Breakout Room setting will be disabled. Collaborative problem solving and brainstorming: Use the shared whiteboard feature to digitally annotate a whiteboard. Allow others in the session to annotate on the same board to share ideas and problem solving methods. A tablet is useful for handwriting. Consultation: You can use Zoom's high-quality audio and video to simply have a discussion with an individual or group of students. Easily share documents or anything else on your computer via screen sharing. Control who joins your session: The waiting room allows you to provide a single Zoom session ID and the ability to invite only selected individuals into the discussion. You can also set a custom message in your waiting room that lets students know you will be with them shortly. Pre-record video You can present slides to further explain a topic that was only touched upon in class or if several students ask the same question. Sessions can be recorded and shared for later viewing. Write on the board If you usually do ""boardwork"" as part of a class session, you have a number of options. Try the Annotation Tools (text box, free form draw/pen, shapes, and highlighter) to guide students or explain a concept. Screen share a camera input so that two cameras can be used at once during a Zoom meeting, with one focused on your writing. You can also join your Zoom meeting on your phone to be able to use its camera as a second camera. Use the Whiteboard feature, which works best when used with a tablet and a stylus. Create a PowerPoint slide or other simple backdrop file on which you can type notes, and share those notes using Screen Sharing. Create a ""shared board""--perhaps managed jointly with teaching fellows--using Google Drive. Prerecord the illustration as a video, then play it during class. As you think about these options, keep in mind whether you need the boards to persist and be distributed to the students after class. Host an interactive review session Host online review sessions leading up to a midterm or exam or an entire lecture. Use Zoom's polling feature to gather feedback on problems or topics to cover and private breakout rooms for discussion. Record the session, and share it for on-demand viewing. We advise muting all remote students and asking a TA to monitor questions in chat."

Teaching & Learning,Adjust settings to look your best on Zoom,"While you shouldn’t stress about how you look on a video call – after all, what you say is more important than your appearance – a little bit of prep work can make a big difference. With Zoom and other technology, you can meet with anyone from anywhere. But just because you’re joining a meeting from home or another remote location doesn’t mean you can slack on professionalism – especially if you’ll be on camera. Use these tips to appear more polished and make a great impression the next time you meet on Zoom. Be aware of your surroundings Strive to provide a plain background so viewers can focus on you instead of personal photos, wall art, or other distractions. To further avoid visual clutter, tidy up the areas of the room that will be seen on camera. Make yourself ""screen ready"" Take a minute to put on a nice shirt and comb your hair. If using a headset (which helps participants hear you better!), make sure it isn’t tangling your hair up. You may discover that getting ready for your work from home day is energizing – and your coworkers will appreciate not having to see your bedhead. Light up your face Make sure the light is in front of you, not behind. If you’re using a lamp, place it behind the screen. Turn off overhead lights, which can cast unflattering shadows. Natural lighting works well, too, but be sure you’re facing the window. Another trick: turn up the brightness on your screen so it illuminates your face. Position the camera at eye-level Many people place their webcam too low, which creates an awkward angle. Set your device on a few books or a box so that you’re looking slightly up to the camera for a more flattering angle. Back away from the screen Experiment with moving your webcam a little closer to your face and a little further away to figure out what works best. Aim to make sure most of your upper body — not just your face — is visible in the camera area. Create a video conferencing space in your home Once you’ve figured out your background, lighting, and web camera placement, you may want to create a permanent space that you can always use for video calls. If you regularly participate in video calls from home, this will make your life much easier!

Teaching & Learning,Improve Audio Quality in Zoom,"These suggestions are for Harvard Zoom users who would like to improve their audio quality during Zoom meetings. Log into your Zoom account, and see Getting Started with Zoom for more information. Use earbuds or a headset Ensure your meeting participants can hear you by using earbuds or a headset; computer microphones may be too far away to pick up your voice clearly. Computer microphones also can pick up room noise and vibrations from your desk. Rustling papers in front of a laptop mic or tapping on your desk is enough to drown out other speakers in the meeting. If you are having trouble using your Bluetooth headphones with Zoom, see the support article Using Bluetooth headphones with Zoom. Work from a quiet location To the extent possible work from a quiet location where you will not be interrupted. Even when using a headset, loud background noises can interfere with your speaking voice. Avoid echoes We all occasionally repeat ourselves, but if every one of your words echoes in a meeting it will be hard to understand you. To prevent echoes, make sure you join your meeting via a single audio source, i.e. computer audio or a phone line but not both. Similarly, when a group attends a meeting make sure only one member is providing the audio for the meeting. Don’t call from the road Joining a meeting while on the road is not a good idea, not only for safety reasons! Road noise or transit announcements are enough to make you hard to understand. Don't overload your device Close any unneeded applications and browser tabs during your Zoom meeting. Change Advanced Audio settings for professional audio uses Certain situations, like musical performances, benefit from disabling the automatically-added audio filters like noise suppression and echo cancellation. See Configuring professional audio settings for improving audio quality. Make sure your device meets the system requirements for using Zoom Review the requirements for PC, Mac, and Linux or iOS, iPadOS, and Android. In particular, ensure you have sufficient internet or cellular bandwidth: Try switching from cellular to Wi-Fi or from Wi-Fi to a wired internet connection to increase the bandwidth available to you. Turn off video and/or screen sharing in your Zoom meeting to preserve bandwidth for audio. After you have made adjustments, you can check your internet connection, audio, and video at zoom.us/test."

Teaching & Learning,Harvard University Security Guide for Qualtrics,"Qualtrics is a powerful tool available to the Harvard community that enables a user to efficiently collect and analyze data. Understanding safe and effective use of Qualtrics is crucial to achieving its users’ desired results. This article is an important guide for general security; please contact HUIT Security to receive detailed advice for specific needs. Planning The Survey A well thought-out security plan is important for the success of your project. When planning your Qualtrics survey, make sure to consider the following questions: What type of data is being collected? Who will have access to this data? Where will the data be collected and accessed? When will the project conclude? What Type of Data is Being Collected? Harvard classifies data in five categories based on the effects of its potential disclosure. The full data classification table and examples can be found at privsec.harvard.edu/classify-risk. When planning a survey, you should consider the data you are collecting. The best way to prevent data from being disclosed is not to collect it. Once collected, protection of the data becomes the your responsibility. Limit the data collected to information required for the research or study. Pay special attention to identifiers such as names and social security numbers. Using Qualtrics to collect high risk confidential level 4 data With proper controls set, Qualtrics surveys can be used to collect responses that contain high risk confidential level 4 administrative data. Please submit this form to receive a short consultation with a Harvard IT staff member, who will help to configure your survey to meet IT Security guidance. Note: De-Identified Data, or data that cannot be directly linked to an individual, is intrinsically less risky to maintain. For guidance relating to the effective use of de-identified data, contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Research at http://vpr.harvard.edu. Who will have access to the data? Qualtrics users are provided many options for collaboration. Individuals from inside and outside the Harvard community can be granted access to a survey, its responses, and its results. Collaborators can be granted very specific permissions, and it is not likely that a survey would require all collaborators to have full rights for the duration of a project. With that in mind, tailor the permissions by considering the following questions: Should this collaborator be able to change, add, or delete questions from the survey? Should they be able to remove any results? Is it necessary for the collaborator to see individual responses at all, or would the aggregate survey results be sufficient? When is input or insight needed from the collaborator? Consider filling out a Collaboration Matrix, similar to the sample provided below. NAME Area of Expertise Permissions Granted Permission Timeline Purpose Joe Smith Information Security View Questions View Survey Revoked at survey launch Provide support in creating a secure survey J.R.R Tolkien Elven Languages View Responses Granted for two weeks after survey closed Translation of Elven Responses to English J.P. Morgan Investing View Results Granted at launch until study completed Provide insight into economic implication of results Once you have chosen your collaborators, make sure they understand their responsibilities. Accounts should never be shared. If survey creators wish to bring in the opinions of others, the other users should be added as collaborators with their Harvard Qualtrics account, a Qualtrics account supported by their institution, or a free Qualtrics account. Accounts should use Harvard credentials for identification and authentication whenever possible. Accounts for non-Harvard users should require complex passwords. See security.harvard.edu for specific guidance on passwords. Now that the collaborators have been informed of their roles and responsibilities, they can be granted specific rights within Qualtrics. Collaborating Inside Your Organization Collaborating Outside Your Organization and with New Users Click ""Details"" to further customize the Edit and View Reports permissions. Where Will the Data be Collected and Assessed? Though Qualtrics provides security for your data when it is stored on their servers, they cannot protect it before it gets to them or after it has been delivered to a collaborator’s web browser. Securing those parts of the process is known as “endpoint” security. Consider creative alternatives in situations where weak endpoint security is suspected. For example, smartphones and tablets offer higher levels of endpoint security than most desktop or laptop computers. Improve endpoint security by following this guide. Bad Idea Good Idea Why? Clicking links from people you don’t know, or weird links from people you do know. Assume links in email are bogus. Use your browser’s address and search options to get you where you need to go (e.g. https://www.paypal.com or https://www.facebook.com) Links can point one way and take you another. This is one of the most common ways accounts are stolen. You don't need to follow the email link to check on your accounts. When in doubt, type it out in the web address bar. Ignoring Updates from Microsoft, Adobe, Java, or other sources. Set up an automatic patch schedule. Most common attacks are carried out using bugs that have patches available because attackers know many people don’t update. Accessing sensitive information in public places such as a coffee shop. Limit use of laptops in public settings. Use password protected screen locks. Stepping away for even a few moments provides enough time for a stranger to be ""you"" on the internet. A locked screen protects your reputation and data. Uninstalling or disabling antivirus software. Use up to date antivirus software on your system. Antivirus is your last line of defense against being hacked. Find one that works for you and keep it up to date. Submit a ticket for assistance. When Will This Project Conclude? Create a timeline for the Survey. Make sure to cover the following milestones. Survey Created Survey Open for Responses Survey Closed for Responses Data Analysis Project Closed Each of these milestones will represent a possible trigger for the Survey administrator, from adding a collaborator to locking results. Plan the schedule so that data isn’t present for longer than needed. When the project is completed, there are several options for handling the data. It can be deleted, downloaded, or maintained on the Qualtrics servers. No matter what path is taken, the survey should be deactivated and all collaborators no longer requiring access should be removed at the conclusion of your project. Maintain with Qualtrics Delete Download PRO Easily access results for reference or further study. Most secure way to prevent data loss. Save the data in a format that can be manipulated by third-party tools. CON Potential for a data breach. The data cannot be retrieved for further reference. Some projects require ongoing access to data or data retention. Burden of data protection is on the user. Depending on the data, there may be regulatory requirements. Collecting Data With your project planned and survey published, it is time to solicit responses. Qualtrics surveys can be distributed through several channels, described on this support page. Use the option that best targets your particular sought after respondents. Limiting the publicity of the survey is a good way to limit risk. For example, if you don’t need feedback from the general Internet, don’t tweet the distribution link. Tips at a Glance Remember these tips to building a secure survey in Qualtrics. Tips for a Secure Survey Ask Yourself… 1. Collect only the data you need. What data am I willing to be accountable for? 2. Only Access Qualtrics From Trusted Devices. Would I do online banking on this device? 3. Collaborate with People You Trust. Would I trust this person with my personal Information? 4. Give the appropriate rights to the appropriate collaborators. Do I want an opinion on everything from everyone? 5. Use Calendar Reminders to remember to add, edit, or remove collaborators. Will I remember any of this six months from now without help? 6. Share your Survey Link responsibly. Do I really need respondents from my second cousin’s Facebook page? 7. If you have a concern, bring it to HUIT Security. Isn’t that what they are there for in the first place? In conclusion With proper planning and execution, Qualtrics can be a secure and effective way to carry out information gathering and collaboration for most any project. Specific support and assistance is always available by contacting HUIT Security."

Teaching & Learning,Add videos to Canvas,"Question: How do I add videos to Canvas? Answer: There are five ways to add instructional videos to Canvas. Note that these recommendations are for instructional videos only. View this article for information about lecture videos. Record a video directly in Canvas Upload video files Link to YouTube videos Link to videos hosted elsewhere Add video files to course Files area -- not recommended Note it’s also possible to add captions to videos hosted in Canvas or to videos hosted outside of Canvas. (See instructions for Instructors or Students.) 1. Record a video directly in Canvas This approach is good for creating brief “talking head” videos to make announcements to the class or provide context for an assignment. Step-by-step instructions on how to record video directly into Canvas: For instructors For students 2. Upload video files This approach is good for uploading existing individual video files. When using this approach keep in mind: The maximum file size is 500mb. This cannot be changed. There is no limit to the number of files you can upload to a course as long as each file is smaller than 500mb. Video files uploaded uploaded into a course count against the course quota. Files uploaded directly to your user files or group files count against each specific quota. When video files are uploaded they are converted automatically to a format supported by your browser. It's the responsibility of the Canvas user to retain a copy of the original unconverted video file if desired. (More information about supported file types.) If a video file is uploaded to a course site, and the site is then copied, the link to the uploaded video will continue to work in the new site. Step-by-step instructions on how to upload video files in Canvas: For instructors For students 3. Link to YouTube videos This approach is good for linking to larger video files that exceed the 500mb size limit for uploading files directly to a Canvas course. Step-by-step instructions on how to link to a YouTube video. Note that Students and Instructors can also link to YouTube videos in discussion replies. 4. Link to videos hosted elsewhere This approach is good for linking to larger video files that exceed the 500mb per video size limit or for videos that are available from other hosting services besides YouTube. Use an iFrame to embed the video in the Rich Content Editor. Add video files to course Files -- not recommended While it is possible to upload video files directly to course files or to a Canvas user’s personal files, this approach is not recommended because the video files will use up storage quota. For example: If a teacher uploads a video file into the assignment description, or into the course Files section, that file counts against the course quota. If a student submits a video file assignment, or uploads a video file to their personal files, that counts against the student’s user quota."

Teaching & Learning,Search By My Requirements (SBR) in my.harvard (Students),"Search By My Requirements Search By My Requirements (SBR) allows you to search for course offerings that will satisfy unmet requirements on the Academic Advising Report (AAR). Please note that your course selection should not be based entirely on the AAR or SBR as these tools do not replace academic advising conversations between you and your advisor. Please view the quick 2-minute Search by My Requirements Video Tutorial. The video transcript is also available to reference. Step 1: Log into portal.my.harvard.edu Step 2: Click on the Course Search tab. Step 3: Click the Search By My Requirements button. Step 4: Click on the red requirement line with the Not Satisfied notation to generate course search results below that will satisfy that requirement. Please see additional information about this at the bottom of the page. In the example above, clicking on the Writing Requirement resulted in 150 courses being found that can meet that requirement. Scroll down the page to view and navigate the full list of course results. Filters will display in the left menu to drill into the course results further (i.e. term, session, school, subject, meeting pattern, course component, course level, divisional distribution, cross registration, and location). Select the appropriate term for which you are looking for courses before reviewing the results. Like in the standard Course Search feature in the my.harvard portal, the SBR will list all courses that are available via Course Search. This will include courses for the current term and the future term in an academic year. The academic year courses remain listed until the first week of June when the courses displayed will then switch over to the next academic year. Please Note: Courses that you have already completed will also show up in the SBR search results if it fulfills a requirement. Please reference the Academic Advising Report (AAR) to confirm which courses are fulfilling requirements. Foreign Language Requirements met through test scores, department placement exams and waived requirements do not display as “Satisfied” in the Search By My Requirements tool however they will show as “Satisfied” in the AAR. Additional Information: Like the Academic Advising Report (AAR), the SBR contains requirements that need to be met for degree completion (i.e. College Requirements, General Education Requirements, Divisional Distribution Requirements, etc.). The requirements that are displayed on the SBR page are taken directly from your Academic Advising Report (AAR). It is recommended that you view the Academic Advising Report (AAR) in tandem with the Search By My Requirements (SBR) by clicking on the red Advising Report button located at the top of the SBR page. Like the AAR, if a requirement is satisfied, there will be a green checkmark along with a Satisfied note by the requirement title in the SBR. In the following example, the Language Requirement and Quantitative Reasoning with Data Requirement are Satisfied. A requirement that is not satisfied will have a red (X) icon with a Not Satisfied notation. In the following example, the Writing Requirement is Not Satisfied. For additional information, such as the number of courses that are still needed to meet a requirement or to see which exceptions have been granted by the department, please review the AAR as the SBR tool does not provide this data. If you have any further questions, please contact your Registrar's Office."

Teaching & Learning,Manage members in Slack,"These steps for adding and removing people in Slack are for members of the Harvard Slack Grid. Add people to your workspace Add people to a channel in your workspace Create a Slack Connect channel Remove people from a channel in your workspace Remove people from your workspace Remove yourself from a workspace Add people to your workspace To invite a Harvard affiliate, you will need to invite them using their ""official"" email address. Please go to the Harvard Directory to find your affiliate's official email address. Invite the new member to your workspace, either as a full member or a guest: A Harvard affiliate with a HarvardKey must be invited as a member. A non-Harvard affiliate, or those without an active HarvardKey, must be invited as a guest. A Multi-Channel Guest may be invited to multiple channels while a Single-Channel Guest will have access to just one channel. Please note: Slack spaces within the Grid may not be used to communicate with perspective/incoming students or employees. Invitees will need to accept the invitation to join: If they are new to the Slack Grid, they will receive an email. If they are already a member of the Slack Grid, they will receive a notification from Slackbot in Slack. Invitees will have 30 days to respond to the invite. After 30 days, a new request will need to be sent. Members can submit a request to invite a new member. They will see a Send Request button rather than a Send Invitation button. The request will be sent to all workspace administrators for approval. Add people to a channel in your workspace Workspace admins and members can add people to a channel. Create a Slack Connect channel You can use Slack Connect channels to communicate with users in workspaces outside the Harvard Grid. Here’s how to get started with Slack Connect channels. Open the channel you'd like to invite people to. (You can also create a new channel.) Click the channel name in the conversation header. Select the Settings tab. Under Slack Connect, click Add people. Enter the email address or name for anyone you’d like to invite to the channel, then click Add. Select An external organization, then click Next.

Teaching & Learning,Signing the Crimson Cart in my.harvard,"Signing the Crimson Cart in my.harvard Depending on your schools policies, advisors may be required to sign the Crimson Cart electronically. For some schools, the advising hold must be removed before a student is permitted to enroll in courses. Step 1. Sign in to my.harvard. Locate the Worklist icon in the upper right hand corner and click the icon. The Worklist icon will indicate how many outstanding to do items are on your list. Step 2. View the Crimson Cart. Click Sign to approve the Crimson Cart. A snapshot of the Crimson Cart is captured in the student's advising journal upon signature. Signing a student's Crimson Cart removes the student's advising hold. For some schools, the advising hold must be removed before a student is permitted to enroll in courses. Once a cart is signed, it will display in grey and list the name of the signer. Some students have multiple advisors. If a student obtains a signature from another advisor, that student will display on your list in grey, and you will see the name of the advisor who signed the student's cart. Likewise, you will see your name appear as the signer for every cart you sign. In the example above, Janet Harvard signed Jane Harvard's Crimson Cart. It is also possible to sign the cart from Crimson Cart section of the student's profile: FAQ: I accidentally signed a Crimson Cart. Please contact your Registrar's Office. FAS: College Advisors, please contact the student's Resident Dean of Freshman or Allston Burr Assistant Dean to discuss reversal. GSAS Advisors, please contact the Registrar's Office to discuss reversal."
Teaching & Learning,Migrate your workspace into the Harvard Slack Grid,"Workspace migrations are for users interested in bringing a standalone workspace on a Free, Pro, or Business+ plan into the Harvard Slack Grid. Workspaces that fit the criteria for Harvard Slack Grid access are approved for migration. It is not possible to export your workspace out of the Harvard Slack Grid once it has been migrated. Workspace administration Content retention and data User migration Billing and payment Coordinate a migration Privacy Workspace administration Owners of standalone workspaces that migrate into the Grid will become workspace admins. Workspace admins control settings and add/remove members. One key difference from ownership is that admins are not able to add apps to their workspace that have not already been vetted by HUIT for security, privacy, and accessibility. Learn more about pre-approved apps and the process of app approval. Harvard’s organizational settings and policies will override individual workspace settings. Depending on permissions, admins may be able to make some adjustments to their workspace settings. Once migrated, the workspace owner will appear as slack_owner or Slack Enterprise Owner. The Slack Enterprise Owner account is used by HUIT administrators to create workspaces and manage the Harvard Slack Grid. Content retention and data All messages and content are retained during the migration, and once you’re in the Grid, content is retained indefinitely. The name and url of the workspace will also migrate. HUIT admins can change the name/url post-migration. Free workspaces will retain 90 days of messages, content, and file history when migrating to the Grid. Paid workspaces will retain all messages, content and file history when migrating to the Grid. Workspace data Once a workspace is part of an Enterprise Grid, admins lose the ability to export public channels from their workspace. Slack does not support imports to Enterprise Grid organizations. As an alternative, you can import data to a workspace outside the Harvard Slack Grid. User migration All users: workspace owners/admins, full members and guests, are migrated. User roles may be changed during the migration process, but all content that they posted will continue to be attributed to them. All active Harvard affiliates must be members in the Grid, and all non-Harvard affiliates must be guests. Outside collaborators If you’ve added collaborators from an external organization, you may either add them as guests or use the Slack Connect feature to participate in the workspace: If outside collaborators do not already use Slack at their organization, they can be added as single or multi-channel guests. Multi-channel guests do incur a cost for your school. For collaborators from an organization that already uses Slack, the Slack Connect feature is recommended instead. Slack Connect users only have access to the Slack Connect channel. Using Connect means these collaborators won’t need to be added to your Grid workspace and therefore do not incur any additional cost for your school. Billing and payment Due to Slack's billing processes, it may take longer to schedule migrations for paid workspaces. Paid workspaces that are migrated into Grid are no longer billed directly. Users in the workspace are included in the active user count for the Grid. Participating schools contribute to the Grid payment based on their active users. Schools oversee how that payment is covered for their constituencies. Once the billing linking process to the Harvard Slack Grid starts, your workspace must migrate. The Academic Technology team will confirm when you are ready to move forward with migrating to the Grid. Coordinate a migration Before scheduling your migration, HUIT Academic Technology will ask you to help with a few administrative tasks: Submit the Slack workspace request form and mention in the Workspace Details that you are requesting a migration for an existing space. Once approved, invite the Slack administrator account to be the new workspace owner (you will be provided with instructions to do this). Academic Technology will install an app called MigrationBot. This Bot will determine which members need to update their email address to match their official email as listed in the Harvard directory. Emails can be changed all at once by any workspace admin. It will also identify any users without a Harvard affiliation that will need to become multi-channel guests in your space, or any active Harvard affiliates that will be upgraded to full members. Free spaces may be updated to a Paid Pro trial to facilitate members’ account changes. It will be your responsibility to communicate these changes to your users. You may feel free to make these changes on your own, or wait for Academic Technology to make them for you. Any outstanding changes will be made by Academic Technology shortly prior to the migration to ensure no one loses access to the space or their history. Academic Technology will discuss migration timing with you and will set a date for the migration. Please note, it may take longer to schedule migrations for paid workspaces. The migration process itself takes approximately 45-60 mins, so users should plan for 60 minutes of downtime for their space. Once the migration is complete, Academic Technology will let you know if everything has been migrated successfully. Users will need to sign in post-migration at https://harvard.enterprise.slack.com or the workspace url. Active Harvard affiliates will sign in using HarvardKey. Non-Harvard users will sign in using the ""I have a guest account"" option. Privacy Once in the Grid, your workspace will be protected by Harvard’s agreement with the vendor. Please ensure that you’re familiar with the Harvard Privacy Statement for Slack. Once you have joined Harvard Slack Grid, you will be searchable by anyone else within the Grid. Slack DMs (direct messages) appear across all workspaces and can be sent to anyone else who is a Harvard Grid member. This can be surprising for new users of the Grid, but it is expected behavior. The Harvard Slack Grid is approved for L3 data. The Harvard Slack Grid does not support Slack AI at this time and has opted out of contributing to Slack's global AI/ML model.

Teaching & Learning,Email your Canvas course members using the Course Emailer,"Send an Email Using the Course Emailer Email Your Entire Course Email a Specific Section of Your Course Configure the Course Emailer Verify Your Default Canvas Email Address Set the Course Emailer Permissions Get Help These instructions are for teaching staff in residential Canvas (https://canvas.harvard.edu/) at FAS, HDS, Harvard Extension School, GSE, HKS, HLS, the Library, Harvard Summer School, HSPH, and HILR that want to communicate via email with enrollees in their Canvas course. HUIT supersenders can also use the Course Emailer. These instructions do not apply to HBS, HMS, or HSDM programs in residential Canvas. Nor do they apply to the separate HBS, HMS, or ExEd Canvas instances. Send an Email Using the Course Emailer The Course Emailer allows teaching staff to send emails to their entire class or a section of their class using their default email client (e.g. Outlook). The Course Emailer also displays enrollees’ email addresses, a feature not available in the Canvas People page. The Course Emailer may be a good option for teaching staff who are more comfortable communicating via email, or who want to keep all of their correspondence within their own email client. It is an alternative to the native Canvas Conversations messaging system. When the Course Emailer is added to a Canvas site, only teaching staff will see it in the left-hand navigation. An email address, used as a mailing list, is created for the course; additional email addresses are created for any section that exists in the course. Membership in each list is automatically updated to reflect changes in course enrollment. Mailing lists use the following format: Entire course mailing list: canvas-xxxx@coursemail.harvard.edu where xxxx is the Canvas course ID from the course URL, e.g.: https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/xxxx/ Section mailing list: canvas-xxxx-12345@coursemail.harvard.edu where 12345 is the section ID Email Your Entire Course Note: Before using the Course Emailer for the first time, be sure to configure the Course Emailer to avoid unwanted errors. To email the entire course, click on the mailing list email address next to the ""Course Mailing List"" header; a window will open in your default email client (e.g. Outlook) with the mailing list address in the ""To"" field. You can also copy the mailing list address and paste it into an email. There is a 25 MB limit on the size of attachments sent using the Course Emailer. Emails sent with an attachment larger than 25 MB will not be delivered. Please upload large files to your Canvas course and include a link to them in your email message. You will receive a copy of any email you send to a mailing list. (This does not apply to HUIT supersenders.) Note that emails sent to mailing lists from concluded courses will receive an error. Email a Specific Section of Your Course If your course has any sections in it, an additional tab will appear labeled “Email Specific Sections.” A mailing list for each section allows teaching staff to email only members of that section. Sections can be created with the Manage Sections tool or with the Student Information System (SIS) (e.g. My.Harvard). The section mailing list can send to either: members of that section and to all staff in the course, even if all staff members are not included in the section being emailed. members of that section only. Teaching staff will not see the email unless they are included in the section the email is sent to. If your course is jointly-offered, cross-listed between schools, or consolidated to share one Canvas site, a new tab will appear labeled “Email Registrar Enrollments.” (See more details in “How do I use the Course Emailer in a jointly-offered or cross-listed course?”) Configure the Course Emailer Before using the Course Emailer for the first time, you should verify your default Canvas email address and set the Course Emailer permissions you need. Verify Your Default Canvas Email Address When using the Course Emailer, you must send or reply to messages from the default email address in your Canvas account. Otherwise your message will not be delivered and you will receive an error. You can change the default email address in your Canvas account if needed. Instructors and students can also add an email address to their Canvas account. Note that if you have two different email addresses and you are sending a message from your first address but have changed your From Address in the email client to be your second address, you must: Add both addresses to your Canvas account, and Set your From Address as your default in Canvas. Set the Course Emailer Permissions Each Course Emailer email address has a permission set on it. The permission determines who can send emails to that particular list. The default permission setting is “Course Access” and can be changed for each list by clicking the gear icon. Permissions options are: Staff Access: For staff to email members of the course; students and guests cannot send or reply to the mailing list. Course Access: For all members of the course to email each other; students and guests can send and reply to the mailing list. Section Access [only available for sections]: For members of the section and all staff to email each other; students and guests in the section can send and reply to this mailing list. Disabled: The mailing list is disabled. Set the permissions as follows: ""Staff Access"" if you want only teaching staff to be able to send to a mailing list. “Course Access” or ""Section Access"" if you want students to be able to send emails to a mailing list. Note that Students cannot see the Course Emailer in the Canvas navigation. However, if the mailing list address is shared with students (for example posted on a Canvas page or if the teaching staff have sent an email to the list) and the permissions for that list have been set to either “Course Access” or ""Section Access"" students will be able to send emails to that mailing list and reply to emails sent from that list. If someone tries to send an email to a mailing list that they do not have permission to send to, they will receive a bounce-back email stating that message wasn't delivered.

Teaching & Learning,Add people to a Canvas course site,"These instructions are for teaching staff and course administrators who want to add people to courses in Canvas. Before trying to do this in Canvas, always try to add people to courses through my.harvard, or your Registrar's office. The steps below are for adding users to courses in Canvas when those options aren't possible. The steps below use the Manage People tool in Canvas, located in the left navigation of your course under Manage Course. Not all Schools have this tool enabled. If you don't see it and think you should, contact your School's academic support staff. Before you add users to a course in Canvas using this process, be aware of the following: Courses with large enrollments (1,000+) will break the Manage People tool. If you have any courses that exceed that enrollment limit, we would strongly suggest breaking them up into cohorts. People added to a course through the Manage People tool will have access to the Canvas site and other tools that use the course groups, but they will not be added as members of a course in my.harvard and its associated tools. You will have to assign each person a role. Roles have been pre-approved by your School and will appear in a menu for your selection. If a person has already been added to the course by the Registrar's office or Admin Console, you cannot use this process to add them in a different role. If you need to add a person to a course with two roles please contact your School's academic support staff for assistance. Users without an appropriate Harvard appointment cannot be added with staff or instructor roles; they can only be added with the Guest role. Only Canvas administrators can add people to concluded courses. Contact your School's academic support staff if you need someone added to a concluded course. Any instructor documentation on adding/removing users from a Canvas course site are not relevant to Harvard users. If you need help, contact your School's academic support staff instead of Canvas's instructor support. Add people to a course site in Canvas Select Manage Course from the left navigation and click on the tool card for Manage People Click Add People to course Use the search bar to find a person using their official Harvard email address or their HUID. If you don't know either, you can search the Harvard Directory to find a person's official email address. The system will return one or more matching user account records. Select an account record for the person you want to add, and choose a role from the drop-down menu. Click Add to course. You should then see a message that the user has successfully been added in the role. If the person you have selected is already in the People list for the course, a message will display showing the person's name and their associated role in the course. If you need to add a user to a course with two course roles (e.g. Student and TA), please contact your school's academic support staff for assistance. Remove people from a course site in Canvas People added using Manage People will be displayed with a red trashcan icon indicating they can be removed from the course. To remove users who either don't appear on the list, or appear with a gray trash can, contact your School's Registrar. People removed from a course will be removed from the primary course section as well as any secondary section they may have been added to using Manage Sections. Select Manage Course from the left navigation and click on the tool card for Manage People. Under Name / ID Type, review the list of course people and find the one(s) you want to remove. Click the red trash can adjacent to the name. Need help? If you need help adding or removing users, please contact the academic support team at your School."

Teaching & Learning,Using Collaborations in Canvas,"Canvas leverages collaborative technology to allow multiple users to work together on the same document at the same time. Collaborative documents are saved in real-time, meaning a change made by any of its users will be immediately visible to everyone. Use Collaborations to: Copy and paste notes that everyone can access. Share bullet-point lists or agendas for upcoming synchronous class or group time or meetings. Create a text-based whiteboard that everyone in the classroom can see and refer to later. Assign student groups a collaborative assignment as a graded assignment (instructor feature). All Canvas courses support Google Docs as the default collaborations tool. Collaborations that leverage Google Docs require that all participating learners have created and linked their Google account to their personal Settings. Google Docs allows you to add up to 50 users per collaboration, and all users can view and edit a document at the same time. However, Google collaborations has a limit as to the number of users who can access a collaboration at any time.

Teaching & Learning,Use breakout rooms in Zoom,"Breakout rooms allow you to seamlessly split your Zoom meeting into separate sessions for small group discussion, and then bring those sessions back together to resume the large group meeting. As the meeting host, you can group participants into these separate sessions automatically or manually, and can switch between sessions at any time. Quick facts: There can be up to 50 breakout rooms per meeting, with up to 200 participants per breakout room Breakout room participants have full audio, video and screen share capabilities Hosts can move between breakout rooms Hosts can allow participants to select and enter breakout rooms as they please Participants can request help from a host while in a breakout room Note: Participants must be using the Zoom application to join breakout rooms; it is not possible to join via a web browser or in-room video conferencing system. As a workaround, these participants can use the main meeting room as their breakout session space. Getting started: Enabling breakout rooms Using breakout rooms Participating in breakout rooms Managing breakout rooms Advanced options: Pre-assigning breakout rooms Self-selecting breakout rooms Breakout rooms and recording Tips Video: breakout rooms Things to know about pre-assigning breakout rooms As a meeting host, you can split your meeting participants into breakout rooms when scheduling the meeting. This can be useful if you already know how you want to split up your participants. Pre-assign participants in the web portal This method is recommended for meetings with less than 20 participants. Pre-assign participants by csv file upload If you have more than 20 students in your class, and/or you will be using breakout rooms several times through the semester and wish your students to be assigned to the same breakout group each time, we recommend you pre-assign breakout rooms with a csv upload. You should NOT use the students' email addresses that are listed in Canvas to populate the csv file. You MUST take students' official Harvard email addresses found in the my.Harvard roster (or from the Registrar's office for schools that don't use my.Harvard). Students can change their preferred email address in Canvas, so using a list of those email addresses would break the csv upload. Once you have created a csv with students' official email addresses from my.Harvard or the Registrar's office, you can pre-assign breakout rooms with a csv upload. Before your meeting, instruct students to sign in to Zoom via SSO (HarvardKey), with the domain name/URL “harvard.zoom.us”. This ensures that students will be recognized by Zoom when they sign in, and they will be automatically assigned to their breakout rooms. Note: If a student arrives late to class and breakout room sessions have already begun, Zoom will now automatically send them to their assigned breakout room. Self-selecting breakout rooms Hosts may give participants the ability to self-select which room they would like to join without needing intervention from the host. Both the meeting host and participants need to be on Client 5.3.0 or later to self-select breakout rooms. Click Breakout Rooms once you have started your meeting Select the number of rooms you would like to create and Let participants choose room: Click Create. Your rooms will be created, but will not start automatically. You can manage the rooms prior to starting them, then you may click Open All Rooms once you are ready: Now that the Breakout Rooms are in progress, all participants can hover over the number of people in each room to select the Join button, which will assign them to that room: Breakout rooms and recording If the meeting is being recorded to the cloud, the recording will only record the main room, regardless of what room the meeting host is in. If the meeting is being recorded to a computer, the recording will include whatever breakout room the person recording participates in. Multiple people can record locally if allowed by the host.

Teaching & Learning,Waitlists in my.harvard,"Waitlists Step 1: Check the Wait list if class is full box to be placed on the waitlist. The option will only appear for applicable classes. Not all schools use waitlists for limited enrollment courses. Step 2: If the system detects that the waitlisted course will cause a conflict with your schedule, you may be given the option to Drop If Enrolled. The Drop If Enrolled feature gives you the opportunity to identify a class to automatically drop if you gain entrance into the waitlisted class. Conflicts that trigger the Drop If Enrolled option are (1) a time conflict or (2) if you are already enrolled in a full course load and acceptance into the waitlisted class will put you above the capacity limit. You can set/edit your Drop If Enrolled preference at any time. NOTE: Failure to define your Drop If Enrolled preference will result in being skipped during the waitlist clearance process if a conflict remains in effect when the system attempts to enroll you."

Teaching & Learning,Waitlist for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Courses,"General waitlist information How to determine if a course offers a waitlist How to enroll in a waitlist Waitlist notifications/course enrollment Drop if Enrolled option Waitlisting for timed sections Please note that the information in this knowledge article is for students trying to enroll into Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FAS) courses offering waitlists. Other Harvard schools' courses may not offer waitlists. Please contact the Registrar’s Office for your school if you have any questions. Information on how to contact the FAS Registrar’s Office is available on this site. General waitlist information Waitlisting is an instructor opted feature for limited enrollment courses that allows students who are prevented from enrolling in a class without an available seat to be placed in a queue, and automatically enrolled later if a seat becomes available. When one student drops the class, the next available student on the waitlist is placed in that open seat by a program that runs every 15 minutes. Waitlists are available during add/drop period and close after the first week of classes. Pay particular attention to the icons shown for each course in your Crimson Cart. This will indicate class seat or waitlist availability: Waitlisting Example: Beginning class capacity and total enrollment = 40 Dropped students = 2 Current total enrollment = 38 Open seats = 2 Waitlist Position Waitlist Program Runs New Waitlist Position Student A 1 Time conflict – remains waitlisted 1 Student B 2 Already enrolled in max credits – remains waitlisted 2 Student C 3 Enrolled in class N/A Student D 4 Enrolled in class N/A Student E 5 Waitlisted 3 Student F 6 Waitlisted 4 How to determine if a course offers a waitlist In my.harvard you can either search for all courses that offer a waitlist, or you can check the course details of an individual course. 1. To do a general search for all courses that offer a waitlist: Enter an asterisk in the course search. Select the term. Select “Yes” to view courses that have waitlists. 2. To review the waitlist details for a specific course, select a course of interest: If Waitlist Class indicates “No” there is no waitlist for the course. If Waitlist Class indicates “Yes”, then there will either be a limit on the number of students that can be on the waitlist or no cap on the waitlist. When there is a cap on the number of students, it will display as a ratio (ex. 1/3 - the waitlist allows a maximum of 3 students and there is already 1 student on the waitlist). If there is no cap, it will just show the number of students currently on the waitlist. A course may not appear full due to reserve caps; however, if you do not meet the reserve cap criteria, you can join the waitlist if the course offers one. If you meet the reserve cap criteria but the course is already in waitlist status, you will be added to the waitlist first by default, and then you will be given a reserved seat if one is available. You will receive automatic notifications of these updates. If you meet the reserve cap criteria but have a registration related error, you will not be able to enroll in the course. How to enroll in a waitlist Waitlists for FAS courses are only available during the add/drop period. 1. Resolve any registration related holds/errors. If you have a hold, you will not be able to enroll in a course’s waitlist, however you will still be able to submit a petition to the instructor. 2. If you have already submitted an instructor petition during the November/April registration week, you can skip to step 8. 3. Add the course to your Crimson Cart, by selecting “Add to Crimson Cart”. 4. Waitlist checker will be selected by default. Click “Next”. 5. Select the course and then click “Enroll”. 6. Select “Finish Enrolling”. 7. Select “Submit Petition”. You may enter optional comments in the next section. 8. Once the petition is approved, you will see a green check mark under the permissions column. Select “Enroll/Validate/Delete”. 9. Select the course and then “Enroll”. 10. Select “Finish Enrolling”. 11. You will receive a confirmation message that you have been placed on the waitlist. 12. A new section Waitlisted Courses will appear that displays your waitlisted courses. If you select the red exclamation, you can view your waitlist position. Waitlist notifications/course enrollment 1. If the next seat on a waitlist opens and you are eligible to be enrolled, you will be automatically enrolled and will receive a confirmation email. The course will now appear in the Enrolled Courses section in your my.harvard Student Home page. 2. You will not be enrolled and will remain on the waitlist if: You have a hold You have a time conflict (based on home school’s policy) You are already enrolled in the max number of credits You are repeating the course You will receive an email notifying you of the first enrollment error identified by the waitlist process. The error email notification is sent once per student, per class, therefore if you have multiple errors you will not receive subsequent notifications. It is your responsibility to address and resolve any errors that may prevent enrollment in the course when the waitlist process runs. Review the Holds in my.harvardknowledge article for an overview on how to view information about any holds you have may left to resolve. 3. Be sure to keep your waitlist status up to date. If you change your mind about a course, select “Drop from Waitlist” before you are automatically enrolled. Drop if Enrolled Option Students are encouraged to use the “Drop if Enrolled” feature to avoid being skipped by the waitlist process when a seat becomes available if a currently enrolled course will cause a time conflict or max unit/credit errors. 1. In your Waitlisted Courses section, you can select “Drop if Enrolled” option if you would like to be automatically dropped from a course of your choosing once you are enrolled from a waitlisted course. 2. Once you click on “Drop if Enrolled”, you will be prompted to select the course that you wish to drop should you be enrolled in a specific course from your waitlist cart. Waitlisting for Timed Sections If you choose to enroll in a waitlist for a closed timed section, you will receive an alert that “you will be waitlisted for all sections of the course,” which means you will also get waitlisted for the primary lecture/course. A seat must be available in the primary lecture/course and the timed section for you to get off the waitlist. That is why you may notice some courses will show as having a waitlist even if there is an open seat, indicating that a student may lose their seat due to being waitlisted for a timed section. There are three scenarios that can result in your timed section being waitlisted. Scenario 1: Enrolling in a primary/lecture course that is open, but the timed section is in waitlist status: The student is put on the waitlist for both the primary/lecture course and discussion/lab. If there is a time conflict between the open primary/lecture course and a currently enrolled class, then you will get a time conflict error and will not be able to enroll in the course’s waitlist. Scenario 2: Student is currently enrolled in an open primary/lecture course and discussion/lab but wants to change to a discussion/lab that is in a waitlist status: If you select “Edit” or “Swap” under your Enrolled Courses, you will be able to edit your timed sections. If you select a section that is in waitlist status, you will be waitlisted for both the primary/lecture course and discussion/lab. If there is a time conflict between the open primary/lecture course and a currently enrolled class, then you will get a time conflict error and will not be able to enroll in the course’s waitlist. Scenario 3: The primary/lecture course is in a waitlist status: You will be waitlisted for the primary/lecture course and the timed section (regardless of if the timed section is open or not). If both the primary/lecture course and timed section are in waitlist status, or if the primary/lecture course is in waitlist status and the timed section is open, you will be able to enroll onto the course’s waitlist even if you have a time conflict with a currently enrolled course. However, you will not be able to get off of the waitlist unless you resolve the time conflict. When waitlisting for the primary/lecture course, it is recommended that students register for the open TBA placeholder section for the class to have the best chance to be enrolled off the waitlist for the primary/lecture course."

Teaching & Learning,Add and manage alternative hosts for Zoom meetings in Canvas,"Overview Roles that can be alternate hosts Editing alternative hosts Changes to course teaching staff Extra help Overview This article explains how Zoom meeting schedulers can use the Zoom LTI in Canvas courses to add and manage alternate hosts when scheduling meetings. Teaching staff who have visited the Zoom page in their Canvas site are automatically added to Zoom meetings as alternate hosts when the meetings are created in the LTI. The person scheduling the meeting may not see all of the teaching staff appear as alt-hosts right away, but rest assured that teaching staff will be granted access to host course meetings once they access the Zoom tool in their course. Note: For cross-listed courses, if the primary course has the automatic alternative host function enabled it will be used for the course. Roles that can be alternate hosts Any Canvas course role based on the Teacher, TA, or Designer roles can serve as an alternative host. In the University residential Canvas instance this includes the roles of Faculty, Teaching Staff, Course Support Staff, Course Librarian, Instructor, Primary Instructor, Secondary Instructor, TF/TA, Faculty Assistant, and Preceptor. Note that in courses with multiple teaching staff, the first teaching staff member to start the Zoom meeting will become the meeting host. All other teaching staff who join the meeting later will be co-hosts. If necessary, the host can pass the host controls to a co-host or another meeting attendee. Editing alternative hosts Add a user with a teaching staff role to a course and have them click on the Zoom LTI page in the Canvas course. Add someone to the ""alternative hosts"" field when editing the meeting details in the Zoom LTI page in the Canvas site. Once a meeting begins, the host can enable a co-host for the meeting or pass the host controls to another meeting attendee. Changes to course teaching staff Any teaching staff added to the course after a Zoom meeting was originally scheduled will be added as an alternative host when they click on the Zoom LTI page in the Canvas course. The first time new teaching staff join a Zoom meeting they will see a Join button to enter the meeting and be added as an alternative host. For all future meetings they will see a Start button they can use to start the meeting as a host. Need help? Contact your local academic support staff if you need additional help managing the hosts for your Zoom meeting."

Teaching & Learning,How do I set permissions on files to restrict them to students?,"Question: How do I set permissions on files to restrict them to students? Answer: You can edit permissions for files, which includes setting the state of the file (published or unpublished), making files available to students who have the link, or scheduling availability dates for files. When you set a link restriction on a file, the file can only be viewed if students are given the link to the file. However, this option only allows files to be hidden from students in Course Files. This functionality is not valid outside of the Files feature. For instance, if a file with a link restriction is added to a Module or Assignment, the file can always be viewed by students. When the student availability date restriction is set, students can view the name and information for the file. In addition to Course Files, files with an availability date restriction can be viewed anywhere in Canvas (such as when the file is added to Modules or Assignments), but the file will be locked and students cannot view the actual file until the specified date. Note that when you link files to a public course syllabus, files restricted by link or date become available (using a verifier code added to the URL) not only to people enrolled in the course, but also to other logged in Canvas users and to people not logged in Canvas at all. In essence, the files become publicly available permanently, even if you restrict them later on. Similarly, if you make your entire course publicly visible, files restricted by link or date become available not only to people enrolled in the course, but also to other logged in Canvas users and people not logged in to Canvas at all. If you want to maintain tighter control over files in your course, do not make your course publicly available. It is recommended that you change course visibility settings to ""Institution”--this means all users associated with Harvard can view the course. For even tighter control, change the visibility setting to ""Course,” and deselect the option to make the syllabus public. Doing this limits your course access to enrollees. (For step-by-step instructions for course visibility options visit https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10436 .) Note: If your course visibility is set to ""Institution"" it is not possible to create a file link that will only work for enrolled students. For links to files in course syllabi and course pages, Canvas cannot differentiate if the link is being clicked by an enrollee in the course or by another logged in member of the Harvard community. For step-by-step instructions on how to restrict files, visit: https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10035 Get Help If you have additional questions, please contact your school's local academic support staff."

Teaching & Learning,Best practices for using Slack in a course,"These best practices are for teaching staff who are interested in using Slack with their courses. Organize your workspace Establish etiquette and community guidelines Embrace informality Try out a successful use case Get help Organize your course workspace Students, instructors, and teaching assistants can organize themselves into groups quickly. Channels can mirror real-world functions like lecture halls and classrooms, offices, and even areas for socializing. In terms of coursework, some of the most common and successful examples of channels are set up for: Online office hours: An #office-hours channel, where students can drop in with questions just as they would during in-person office hours, is a great resource teaching staff can offer students. Be sure to set and follow expectations around availability -- note that questions posted outside of office hours will be addressed at a later time, or a similar policy. Small group discussions: A private channel between an instructor and a small group of students may be just the thing to help you create a safe space to ask questions and share thoughts, ideas, and assignments. You can also use DMs (direct messages) to privately communicate with up to 8 workspace members. Project-based learning and lectures: Gather students, instructors, and TAs into project- or lecture-based channels, and you’ll be opening up a space for discussion. Thanks to features like search and pinning messages to channels, students can learn from the questions their peers have posted before them, saving educators time while ensuring that students are getting the information they need. Create successful channels Structure channels in a simple way. If students can't tell what a channel is for by reading the name, it's too complicated. Consistently name and provide topics for your channels, for example: #course-info: course information #q-and-a: general Q&A #assignment-1: discussion of assignment 1 section-1: private channel for section 1 section-2: private channel for section 2 teaching-staff-only: private channel just for teaching staff Broadcast announcements in a read-only channel Ensure critical info reaches the intended audience Limit posting permission to those who need it Allow students to reply (in-thread only) or just to ""react"" with emojis Create an #office-hours channel. You can start a Zoom video call by typing /zoom slash command in the message field of a channel or direct message. Establish etiquette and community guidelines Prompt students to: Be good citizens of Slack: answer questions, assume best intent, try not to sidetrack conversations. Understand public and private channels, and try to communicate with the proper audience. Use threads to organize smaller group discussions around specific topics. Format messages so that they’re easier to read. Use emoji reactions liberally to acknowledge messages while keeping channels from becoming inundated with reaction messages. Use the search function to try to find an answer, reducing duplicate questions. Manage notifications to reduce information overload and maintain focus. Remember that there are situations when it's best to move the conversation off of Slack messaging. Students can meet face-to-face using Zoom or Slack huddles. Embrace informality! Students want to communicate with professors, but traditional office hours often don’t meet their needs. They have questions, but the formality of email creates a barrier, deterring students from reaching out. Introduce Slack early and have students use it often to build familiarity. Encourage students to create their own channels, which may lead to more engagement. Try out a successful use case Here are a few setups for Slack that have been successful at Harvard and beyond: Create a virtual classroom community, with students supporting each others' learning. Alert classes about assignments and schedules. Interact in real-time or asynchronously, including everyone in the discussion regardless of different time zones. Create a live channel during a synchronous class for group note-taking and discussions. Give students a space to touch base after a course meeting. Support teaching staff by creating a space to discuss course structure and technical details. Reduce email use by communicating in open channels and building a shared searchable archive. Support students Steps: Create a channel specifically for students’ questions (e.g. #q-and-a), and one for #office-hours Add the Zoom for Slack app to start virtual meetings right from Slack Emojis may be used to “second” a question or show support Benefits: Students and teaching staff will know exactly where to go to receive and give support, respectively Students may help out their classmates if they know the answer to a question, too Communicate casually Steps: Give your community some guidelines and resources for getting started Let your community build out the workspace organically Benefits: Students will feel more comfortable building relationships with fellow classmates and teaching staff members in a low-stakes environment Students in different time zones may have an easier time catching up on conversations that happened earlier Support teaching staff Steps: Create one or more channels to use as back channels to communicate with course staff only Benefits: Teaching members will have the space to collaborate effectively Students will experience a more streamlined classroom environment Create a live channel during class Steps: Create a channel for in-class discussions Create a channel for synchronous note-taking If participation points are used in the course, offer points for organizing or moderating sets of group notes Benefits: Students have the opportunity to ask questions as they are fresh in their minds A notes channel pushes students to rely on their learning community for support, rather than depending on the instructor Debrief after a course meeting Steps: Create a channel for post-class-session discussions Benefits: Students will be able to clarify any questions about course content or next steps with assignments Students will be able to engage with the material further Announce assignments and scheduling Steps: Set the expectation for where students will find course announcements—will it be in Canvas, Slack, or elsewhere? Make sure everyone is aware of what they need to keep an eye on Guide your students to configure their notifications in Slack Set norms: if you are using an #announcements channel, you may want to guide your workspace community to create a channel-specific notification so students may be notified when anything is posted in that channel Note that email notifications may be set up to notify you of mentions and direct messages when you are not active in Slack Benefits: Students will not have to figure out setting up notifications on their own Students will know that they are receiving all important pieces of communication Teaching staff will be assured that students are receiving notifications Use Slack as part of a set of streamlined course tools Steps: Ask yourself and other course staff members a few questions to determine whether Slack may be a good tool to try out: Is there already a discussion tool in place for this course that fits our needs? Are there a number of other course tools that students need to learn? Would Slack add another learning curve for students to overcome? Are the students already familiar with Slack or other tools from other parts of their lives? If you decide to implement Slack, consider: Providing some light training for students to learn this platform Create a required assignment prompting students to log in to the workspace and orient themselves Set aside a few minutes during class time to show students the workspace and how it will be used Surveying your students throughout the course to see whether Slack has been a useful tool for them Benefits: Students will only need to learn the course tools that will be beneficial to their learning Students will feel that their opinions are being heard Get help If you need help using Harvard Slack in your courses, please submit a ticket or call 617-495-7777."

Does the Resource conform to the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, level 2.1 AA? The framework set forth below presents principles instructors should follow when they make Resources available for use by their students. If a Resource has a green light treatment, it is appropriate to present the Resource to students as a required resource. If a Resource has a yellow light status, the Resource should be presented only as an optional resource. If a Resource is assigned a red light designation, instructors should not recommend the Resource for use even at the student’s option. For assistance in evaluating Resources for use in courses, instructors can also contact ithelp@harvard.edu or their school's local academic technology support. Green Light Resources Applies when: The Resource meets both the Privacy Standard and the Accessibility Standard. Privacy Standard A Resource may meet the Privacy Standard in one of five ways: The Resource does not require user registration or credentialed login. The Resource is entirely passive/informational or does not store PII about users and will not be used to store PII about students. The Resource has been acquired subject to Harvard’s Personal Data Rider. Sufficiency of Privacy Policy/HUIT Security Review. — The Resource has posted a Privacy Policy by which it commits at least to reasonable administrative and technical measures to secure PII and provides privacy assurances at least as stringent as the following: The Resource will not sell access to student[2] PII. The Resource will not use student PII provided for purposes of accessing the Resource, except as needed to provide the Resource to the student or instructor. The Resource will not disclose within or outside the Resource organization any student PII provided for purposes of accessing the Resource, except as needed to provide the Resource to the student or instructor, And in the case of disclosure to outside contractors, the outside contractors agree not to disclose the PII to third parties and to use the PII only as needed to provide the Resource. The Resource allows students and instructors to delete or remove PII. PII Avoidance Strategy. — In a case where a Resource only requires users to register and does not otherwise collect PII, an instructor may advise/ encourage students to create accounts using pseudonymous information. Accessibility Standard A Resource meets the Accessibility Standard in one of two ways: The Resource has been acquired subject to Harvard’s Accessibility Rider. Accessibility Review + Accommodations The Resource has been reviewed by School or central accessibility staff for adequate levels of conformance to applicable accessibility guidelines and to the extent an exception is required, accessibility staff is satisfied that accommodations may be made to students to provide appropriate access. If instructors are unsure whether a Resource fits either of these criteria, they should contact ithelp@harvard.edu or their local school level academic technology support. Treatment Instructors may freely introduce the Resource to students and require them to access and use it. Examples Examples of green-lighted Resources include YouTube and Google Books. Yellow Light Resources Applies when: Instructors or supporting personnel post PII about students to the site/tool/platform, or Students post their PII to the site/tool/platform, or Students must register as users in order to access and use the site/tool/platform. Treatment Instructors may make the Resource available to students only on an optional basis — i.e., use of the Resource is not required in the course, and a student’s decision not to use the Resource will not affect the student’s grade. In addition, instructors or their Schools may undertake the following steps to move a yellow-lighted resource to green: Harvard-Specific Contractual Commitments Instructors and their Schools should work with Procurement and/or HUIT to get a signed contract in place with the Resource provider. At a minimum, the contract should: Apply to all use of the Resource by Harvard instructors. Include the Personal Data Rider with the Rider’s optional FERPA language included. Include the Digital Accessibility Rider. Include appropriate language restricting the use of Harvard names. Override any terms of use that purport to apply to Harvard based on a Harvard instructor’s clickthrough agreement. Student clickthroughs will not affect the enforceability or applicability of the terms imposed by Harvard. Upon execution of a contract that meets these requirements, the Resource could be considered a green light status. Other Pathways to Green Absent a written contract with the Personal Data Rider included in it, a Resource may meet the Privacy Standard if it meets the conditions set forth above for “Sufficiency of Privacy Policy/ HUIT Security Review.” In such cases, OGC should review the applicable Privacy Policy to confirm that the above requirements are met. In addition, an instructor may meet the Privacy Standard by advising students consistently with the provisions set forth above in “PII Avoidance Strategy.” Absent a written contract with the Accessibility Rider included in it, a Resource may meet the Accessibility Standard if it meets the conditions set forth above for “Accessibility Review + Accommodations.” Instructors should be aware that some tools are not accessible to students who require accommodations. If a student with such needs is part of the class, then instructors must consult with their Local Disability Coordinators to identify alternate approaches and set in motion necessary support steps. Compelling Exceptions In the event that Harvard is unable to assign a green light designation by any of the means listed above, an instructor may petition HUIT and VPAL for green light designation (an “Exception Petition”). An instructor should submit an Exception Petition only after exploring all options to meet the Privacy and Accessibility Standards, including by negotiating an appropriate contract with the Resource provider and engaging OGC and HUIT for Privacy Policy and security reviews, respectively. The instructor must be able to state a compelling case in the petition for why the pedagogical benefits of using the Resource significantly outweigh any security or privacy concerns the Resource provider has declined to address. The absence of a green light designation makes a Resource presumptively unsuitable for required use by students. Accordingly, only the rare compelling case will warrant the grant of an exception. In no event may Harvard instructors use a Resource if its use would cause Harvard to violate applicable law. Red Light Resources Applies when: The Resource provider sells access to user PII or otherwise discloses (or allows or asserts a right to disclose) PII to third parties, except as needed to facilitate operation or improvement of the Resource. Treatment Instructors should not require or advise students to use the Resource, even on an optional basis. Additional Policies and Guidelines In their dealings with Resource providers and vendors, instructors should be mindful of the following Harvard policies and guidelines: Policy on Use of Harvard Names and Insignias Use of Harvard Names and Insignias in Electronic Contexts Guidelines for Responding to Requests from Third Parties for Endorsements Contact Information Please contact ithelp@harvard.edu with any questions or concerns about these principles for use of online third-party resources. [1] For these purposes, “personally identifiable information” means a student’s name; the name of the student’s parent or other family members; the address of the student or student’s family; a personal identifier (such as the student’s Social Security number, HUID number, or biometric record); other indirect identifiers (such as the student’s DOB, POB, and mother’s maiden name); other information that alone or in combination is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty; or information requested by a person that Harvard reasonably believes knows the identity of the student. [2] For these purposes, “students” includes graduate students who are assisting with instruction, e.g., as Teaching Fellows or pursuant to a similar appointment."

Teaching & Learning,Quizzes in Canvas,"Question: What are Quizzes in Canvas? Answer: Quizzes in Canvas are assignments that can be used to challenge student understanding and assess comprehension of course material. The quiz tool is used to create and administer online quizzes and surveys. Quizzes can also be used to conduct and moderate exams and assessments, both graded and ungraded. Canvas has four different types of quizzes: A graded quiz is the most common quiz and rewards students points based on their quiz responses. A practice quiz is a learning tool to see how well users understand course material without providing a grade. A graded survey rewards students with points for completing a survey but grading is not based on right or wrong answers. An ungraded survey obtains opinions or other information without providing a grade. You can use Quizzes to: Create new quizzes with individual questions and question groups Set up question banks Import external quizzes Show one quiz question at a time Create quizzes for all students, individual students, or course sections For step-by-step instructions on how to use Quizzes visit: https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/tkb-p/Instructor#Quizzes"
Teaching & Learning,Using Discussions in Canvas,"Canvas provides an integrated system for class discussions, allowing both instructors and students to start and contribute to as many discussion topics as desired. Discussions allows for interactive communication between two or more people; users can participate in a conversation with an entire class or group. Discussions can also be created as an assignment for grading purposes (and seamlessly integrated with the Canvas Gradebook), or simply serve as a forum for topical and current events. Discussions can also be created within student groups. Discussion topics can be a focused or threaded discussion. Focused Discussions are relatively short-lived interactions that tend to ""disappear"" as the course progresses, such as a weekly forum for questions related to that week's activities. Use a Focused Discussion for single posts and related comments. One discussion leader typically posts a message and multiple learners comment on it. Participants may leave a side comment to a reply, but cannot develop the conversation beyond two layers of nesting. Threaded Discussions allow replies within replies and may persist for a longer period of time throughout the course. They lend themselves to the refining of complex ideas. Responses and different lines of inquiry can be quickly navigated due to their hierarchical structure. One or more discussion leaders post a message and multiple learners comment on it with the freedom to create any number of related discussion topics and comments (infinite layers of nesting).

Teaching & Learning,Copy content from another course in Canvas,"This article is intended for faculty who wish to copy part or all of a previous course's content into your new course. You can copy course content such as assignments, modules, pages, and discussions from your previous Canvas courses into current courses. For details go to: https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-12935 Notes about copying course content: When possible, content should be imported from the other course(s) before any edits or changes have been made to the current course. This will minimize confusion if similar content is in both courses. Also, if you import and edit the content in the current course, and later import the same content again, your new course will include both the edited and original content. Course settings, group sets, scheduler appointments, and student submissions and grades cannot be imported. LTI tool integrations may behave unexpectedly (i.e. they may remain configured for the other course or be reset for a new course). You are able to adjust, shift, or remove due dates associated with course events and assignments during the import, which works best in structured courses. More information is available at https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-13099 Best practices when importing the entire contents of a course: Confirm events and due dates Confirm course settings are correct Reconfigure any course navigation items created through the Redirect Tool Test all LTI tools Need Help?

Teaching & Learning,Manage who can see your Canvas site,"These instructions are for faculty and teaching staff who manage a course's Canvas site. Manage who can see your Canvas site The default visibility settings for your Canvas site are determined by your School’s policy. Some Schools change these settings during shopping period to allow prospective enrollees to view course content, but otherwise, teaching staff can customize the visibility options for a course or for specific course content to allow access for different people. Check your Canvas site’s current visibility setting Click Settings in the left navigation bar. Near the bottom of the Course Details tab, you will see a Course Visibility section. Choose the option that best suits your needs: Course: The course is available to all users associated with or enrolled in the course. Institution: This setting allows users who are logged in to Canvas to view the course content without being enrolled in the course. The content shown is the same as what is shown to the public in publicly visible courses. Users include anyone who has the ability to log in to Canvas with their HarvardKey and may include members of the Harvard community with the following current or former roles: students program participants alumni faculty staff sponsored affiliations (a broad category that can include consultants/contractors, collaborators, volunteers, tenants, non-Harvard academic advisors, overseers, and others) Public: The course is available to anyone with the URL. Making your course or course content publicly visible will supplant all other visibility settings you may have selected. This setting also makes the files within that course site publicly visible and potentially searchable by search engines (like Google). Please bear in mind copyright and publishing considerations before making courses publicly visible. Need help? If you need help with the visibility settings of your Canvas site, contact your local academic support staff."

Teaching & Learning,Instructional contingency recommendations,"These recommendations are to help faculty plan for technology disruptions while teaching remotely. Be Prepared What if there is a Zoom outage? During the class In the event of a long-term outage What if my class gets Zoom Bombed? What if there is a Canvas outage? During the class In the event of a long-term outage Be Prepared Teaching remotely means being prepared in different ways than in-person teaching. Have a clear plan for both global outages and interruptions to your individual Internet connection that you share in advance with your students, and tell them where you will communicate in the event of an issue. Download your class roster from my.harvard or ask for it from your registrar. Determine how you will contact your students if the technology you normally use is not available. For example, you can use the my.Harvard Faculty Center to email your students. Other methods might include Canvas announcements, the course emailer, Slack, etc. Choose a backup strategy: Applying a low-tech alternative to the class meeting (see the minimal bandwidth options below). Scheduling a make-up class session. Using an alternative/backup technology such such as Microsoft Teams or Slack. Ensure you have class materials available to you outside of Canvas. Be ready to send readings, assignments, or slides by your selected technology. If you use the Gradebook, save a copy as a spreadsheet to another location. Communicate your backup strategy to your students so that everyone knows what will happen in case of a global or individual outage. Minimal-Bandwidth Class Alternatives There are several modifications you might make to your course if network bandwidth becomes an issue. Here are some ideas based on the type of course: Lecture-oriented: If the instructor will almost exclusively be talking over slides, etc., turn off student video streams. This can be done ahead of time, or during a class session itself. Students do not need to have their own video turned on in order to use the raise hand feature, or to ask questions in the chat dialog. Case-based (and small- to medium-sized lecture courses emphasizing student participation): If the engagement afforded by seeing student video streams is needed, instructors can break the class sessions into chunks with different groups of students turning on their video feeds at different times. For example, students with last names A-M are turned on for the first half of class, and N-Z for the last half of class. This ensures equity in this more interactive class format. Second, classes can make use of the chat platform in Zoom, which requires relatively little internet bandwidth. Small group discussions, seminars, etc: In this setting, the same strategies outlined above can be used. It may be straightforward to ask students to individually turn on their camera when speaking, and then turn it off once done. It is important to remember that when a student turns on their video it puts additional pressure on their own connection to Zoom. Be understanding if some students need to turn off their video because of bandwidth limitations. What if there is a Zoom outage? During the class If you encounter an unexpected interruption to your Zoom session: Wait 90 seconds -- Zoom will try to reestablish your connection. Leave and rejoin the meeting. Verify with HUIT that Zoom is experiencing issues. If you have local network issues, you may need to connect with an available mobile device. Use Canvas announcements to share next steps (for example, that students should rejoin the meeting). In the event of a long-term outage Go low(er) tech. Assign readings and have students submit response papers or other alternative assignments via Canvas, Google, or email, in lieu of a lecture or seminar discussion. Use Assignments and Quizzes in Canvas to assess student understanding. Use discussion tools for one-on-one or group communications using Canvas, Microsoft Teams, or Slack. Use text messaging for group chat or quick questions. Schedule a make-up class session. Record your classes for student download Pre-record your first lecture and have it on stand-by in case you need it. Use Zoom or Panopto to share the recording in Canvas. Use the narration feature in Powerpoint or Keynote to record over a slide deck to also share in Canvas. Consider recording remaining lectures in advance and have them ready to go. Use an alternative technology Use supported video conferencing tools in Microsoft Teams or Slack, as recommended and supported by your school IT staff. Note the following considerations: Microsoft Teams allows all users except DCE students to create meetings, can support up to 300 participants, and does not have break-out rooms or a dial-in option. Slack is available to the College and GSAS, and is in pilot at other schools. It can support video for small groups of up to 50 participants. Review more information about specific tools and resources. What if my class gets Zoom Bombed? Zoom bombing is when meetings are purposefully (and often offensively) disrupted. We have enabled default security settings in Harvard Zoom accounts to help secure your Zoom meetings, but if Zoom bombing does occur you should end the Zoom meeting immediately and move to your contingency plan. Talk to your students in advance about resuming your class meeting in the event of a disruption. Let them know: Where they should look for information from you (Canvas announcement, email, etc.) How you'll plan to resume (another Zoom meeting, online discussion in Canvas or elsewhere) That it may take a bit of time to regroup and that you thank them for their patience. After class, report the incident. Make a note of the meeting ID and send an email to ithelp@harvard.edu. What if there is a Canvas outage? During the class Verify with HUIT that Canvas is experiencing issues. Use your alternative method of communication to let your students know about next steps. HUIT and your school academic technology groups will keep you and the entire community informed. In the event of a long-term outage Communicate the plan to transition to alternative means of sharing content and interacting. Communicate your expectations of your students -- will you extend deadlines, utilize email for submissions, etc. Place the materials you previously downloaded in your alternative platform."

Teaching & Learning,Slack UI Overview,"Overview Check out Slack's documentation of the new user interface and How-To's videos: Slack's New UI Design How-To's Videos on Slack UI Design Getting started with Slack's design in the Harvard Grid: Home View Filtering Workspaces Tips for Organizing Channels Switching between Harvard Grid and External Workspaces Slack Navigation Bar Direct Messages Activity Area Later Profile Icon Templates Themes Home View If you are a member of multiple Harvard Grid workspaces, the workspaces are unified within your Slack sidebar. By default, your sidebar will contain all channels from all your workspaces. In the All workspaces view of your sidebar, you will see a list of channels from every workspace you are a member of. Channels with the same names such as general will also list workspace in the channel title. To determine what workspaces a channel belongs to, click on the name of the channel above the channel messages to Get channel details. Within channel details, you will find the channel topic, description, and what workspaces have access to the channel. If you are a member of only one Harvard Grid workspace, you will see the title of your workspace as “Harvard University” and the unique icon of the workspace. You will not have the All workspaces drop-down menu. Filtering Workspaces You can always filter to a certain workspace from the All workspaces drop-down to view channels only within that workspace. To view an individual Harvard Grid workspace: click on the Home icon. Then, click the All workspace drop-down located on the sidebar under “Harvard University” and select which workspace you want to view. To reorder the workspace filter: click the All workspaces drop-down under “Harvard University”. Select Edit and reorder workspaces from the menu. Drag, and drop a workspace name to reorder on the list. To remove a workspace, hover over a workspace name and click Remove. Click Save & Reload when done. There are a number of Home preferences you can set to tailor how Slack is organized. Learn more about adjusting your Sidebar Preferences. Tips for Organizing Channels Star channels and direct messages. All your most important conversations will appear in the Starred section of your sidebar. Create custom sections for channels. Using custom sections can help organize your channels, direct messages (DMs), and apps within your sidebar. Mute the channel, if there’s too much chatter. Muted conversations will appear grayed out in your channel list. You will only receive a notification if mentioned. View unread messages. In the All workspaces channel view, it’s helpful to have unread channels appear at the top of your sidebar. Switching between Harvard Grid and External Workspaces If you’re signed in to an external workspace (workspaces outside the Harvard Grid), use the workspace switcher to move between spaces. Use ⌘+Shift+S (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+S (Windows) to access the workspace switcher. If you would like to always see your external workspaces, select Show workspace switcher. For more tips and tricks with shortcuts, visit Slack keyboard shortcuts webpage. Slack Navigation Bar Your Slack sidebar is the access point for different parts of your workspace. Users can rearrange tabs to prioritize the tools they use frequently in the Harvard Grid. Learn more about adjusting your sidebar preferences in Slack. Direct Messages Slack added a new Direct Messages (DM) notification view with its own icon. You can still access your DMs in the bottom of your sidebar where channels live. Users can DM anyone in the Harvard Grid: Confirm you have the right user. Users across the Grid do not automatically have access to your workspace. Activity Area The Activity icon in the Slack sidebar is where you can quickly review all of your notifications. When you open Activity, you’ll land in the All tab — a chronological feed of your notifications. Click each tab to switch between the different types of notifications, like mentions, replies to threads or reactions to your messages. You will see a badge on the Activity icon every time you receive a notification. Reactions to your messages won't trigger a badge, but you will be able to view which messages have new reactions as they happen. As a reminder, you can configure your Slack notifications and manage your notifications for specific channels and DMs. Later The Later section is where your saved messages and files in Slack are stored to easily refer to them later, or you can set yourself a reminder to come back to something at a more convenient time.

If your Calendar becomes too crowded, you can filter the number of events listed on your Calendar by selecting or deselecting courses in the Sidebar. It's designed to display up to 10 calendars at any given time. To help manage users' calendars, courses selected as a ""favorite"" in the courses drop-down menu will appear at the top of the user’s calendar list in the calendar sidebar. The Calendar can be used to: View and create activities in your course as well as events and personal reminders; you can also filter the calendar view to only see specific calendars.

Teaching & Learning,Using the Course Info Tool in Canvas,"Question: What is the Course Info Tool in Canvas? Answer: The Course Info Tool pulls data about a course from the Registrar's Office via the student information system (e.g. my.Harvard) and embeds it within a rich content editor box in that course's Canvas site. The Course Info Tool may already appear on your Canvas site if your school has chosen to include it in the course template for your school. Who can use the tool? Anyone who has access to use a rich content editor will be able to embed the Course Info Tool. Where can I add the tool in my Canvas site? Teaching staff most commonly choose to include the Course Info tool in their Syllabus or Home page. It may be embedded in any page that has the rich content editor, for example: Syllabus, Pages, Announcements, Assignments, Quizzes, Discussions, etc. How do I add the tool to my Canvas site? Navigate to a rich content editor. Within the editor, select Tools>Apps>Course Info tool A box will pop up to allow you to select which information you'd like to include. Click on the checkboxes to select the categories of information you want to appear. Choices include the school and course code, term, instructors, location, meeting time, exam group, course description, and a notes section that allows you to enter text. If information is available from the Registrar for each field, it will be previewed in this window. You can choose to keep a field selected even if there is currently no information for that field. As Registrar information is added or updated, new information will be displayed. Click on the ""Save"" button. The editing pop-up box will close, and you will then see a large gray box, which indicates that the Course Info Tool was successfully embedded in the page. You can save the page as is or add text before or after the embedded Course Info tool. If some of the course information changes, does the tool update? Yes, the tool updates automatically. If the registrar alters any information related to the course, the information displayed in the tool is updated. Can I change which categories of information the tool displays? You can't change the categories of information the tool displays. Instead, you will need to delete the tool and add it again. Can I change the information displayed in the categories? The information displayed in the tool is fed from the Registrar's Office or student information system (e.g. my.Harvard) and is the same information displayed in the course catalog. If information is incorrect, please go through the normal channels as you would when updating course information for the catalog. Why aren't all the selected categories of course information being displayed? If a category of information you selected to include isn't appearing, it means there is no information being fed from the registrar for that category. If this is occurring, you will see a message underneath the course information box stating ""Additional Information will be shown if available from the Registrar."" Once the registrar begins feeding the information, it will appear in the tool. Please contact your Registrar if any information that’s displayed needs to be changed. Who do I contact for help using the tool? Contact your local school support with any questions."

Teaching & Learning,Privacy guidance for LTI tool development,"Privacy guidance for LTI tool development Software that integrates with Canvas via LTI, or that uses OAuth tokens to interact with the Canvas API on behalf of users, can have access to information that is governed by FERPA and by University privacy and data security policies. It’s important that all software and systems that handle and store this data operate in a manner consistent with University policy. Software developers and technical staff can find more details on the Harvard University Information Security website. Generally speaking, this means ensuring that sensitive data is transmitted and stored securely, and that proper controls are in place to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the information. You can find helpful guides on how to assess your own information security practices on the Information Security website. All HUIT groups complete this security assessment every year, and it’s a good practice for people who have access to sensitive data to review their local practices as well. If your application will use OAuth tokens to operate on behalf of (impersonate) users, it’s extremely important that these tokens are stored securely and used properly. One user’s token must never be used to read or write data in Canvas on behalf of a different user."

Teaching & Learning,About my.harvard Ideas,"About Ideas my.harvard Ideas was established to gather feedback and suggestions for improvements from the Harvard community. Over the years, the my.harvard team has listened to concerns from students, instructors, advisors, and staff about the challenges they encounter when using my.harvard. We aim to address many of these issues with future updates. The first phase of these enhancements is the introduction of the new Course Search BETA. We encourage you to explore it if you haven't already! How Do I Submit an Idea? To begin, we ask you to review existing Ideas. You can do this by using the Search Ideas feature on the Ideas homepage to browse through current submissions. If you come across an Idea you support, you can show your approval by clicking on it in the search results and then selecting the upvote button. If you have a unique suggestion that isn’t already listed, start the submission process by clicking the Submit an Idea button on the Ideas homepage. When describing your Idea, please provide as much detail as possible to ensure we fully understand your suggestion. What Kind of Ideas Can I Submit? You can submit Ideas of any kind! We are particularly interested in suggestions for enhancing major components of my.harvard, such as Course Search, Student Search, Student Home, or Instructor/Advisor Home. We also welcome feedback on workflows like enrollment, cross-registration, and lifting holds. At the same time, we value suggestions for minor improvements, such as noting if an icon, error message, or other element is confusing, difficult to locate, or not quite right. What Happens After I Submit an Idea? Once you submit an Idea, it will initially have a Submitted status. Ideas in this status are not yet included in the search results nor are they available for upvoting. Shortly after your submission, we will review your Idea and update its status. Some of the potential statuses your Idea may receive include: In Review Ideas with this status are currently under review by the my.harvard team. If your Idea is deemed unique and aligns with our Community Standards, its status will be updated to ""Published."" Published Ideas with this status have been approved for inclusion in the search results and are available for upvoting. Other members of the Harvard community can view the details of your Idea and have the opportunity to upvote it. Selected Ideas that have reached this status have been chosen for future enhancement of my.harvard. Although your Idea is planned for implementation in an upcoming update, we may adjust some details during the development process. Complete Ideas in this status have already been implemented. Thank you for your valuable contribution! Declined Ideas in this status are generally not feasible from a technical or policy standpoint. Occasionally, an Idea might be viable but is outside the scope of my.harvard, such as suggestions for improving other Harvard systems or services like Canvas. Removed Although not technically a status, we reserve the right to remove your submission from Ideas if it contains inappropriate content or language, is unrelated to my.harvard, or otherwise fails to meet our Community Standards. How Can I Track the Status of the Ideas I Submit? Once you've submitted an Idea, you can track its progress on the My Ideas page. To access this page, click on your name in the toolbar and select My Ideas from the dropdown menu. Community Standards Ideas are constructive and specific. Rather than simply expressing complaints, submissions must include clear descriptions of how they aim to improve my.harvard. While you don't need to provide technical details such as code or configurations, it’s important to offer enough information for a basic understanding of your Idea's concept. Ideas that lack sufficient details may be removed. Ideas are respectful and do no harm. Ideas should not negatively target or criticize members of the Harvard community or its policies. Submissions containing inappropriate or offensive language, or those deemed harmful, will be removed."

Web Publishing & Hosting,Pantheon Managed Web Hosting for WordPress and Drupal,"What is Pantheon? Pantheon provides managed hosting optimized for custom Drupal and Wordpress sites. Harvard has partnered with Pantheon to offer web hosting packages to accommodate a wide range of site types and needs. Pantheon’s hosting services are available to internal Harvard teams building custom sites or those working with a third party developer/outside vendor. See also: Getting started with Pantheon Why host your site with Pantheon? Harvard Web Publishing’s platform offerings (OpenScholar and CampusPress) cannot address every use case for Harvard websites. In some cases, internal Harvard teams may build or work with a third party to develop a custom site, which, once launched, will require hosting. Pantheon hosting is a great option for web developers and website administrators who will be managing their sites independently. In June, 2020 Harvard established a Master Services Agreement (MSA) that brings contractual consistency, reduced pricing, and a dedicated team at Pantheon to on-board and support site owners. Pantheon’s hosting packages are designed to accommodate a wide range of site types, from simple/low traffic to complex/highly trafficked. Benefits of Pantheon Vetted: Harvard terms and contract riders already account for PII, GDPR, and accessibility. Pantheon will assess your needs then capture in an Order Form that references the MSA. Pricing: A standard Harvard price book which includes 30% discount off platform and value-added services Support: Diamond Level support for all Harvard sites with a dedicated account and support team On-boarding and migration services are provided at no cost HarvardKey integration w/ the Pantheon Dashboard Who is Responsible for Support? Pantheon provides on-boarding and migration support for new sites. Once a site is launched, Pantheon’s role is to provide the infrastructure and hosting management platform.

Web Publishing & Hosting,Video Hosting Options,"DESCRIPTION: Currently, Harvard Web Publishing recommends two options for your video hosting needs: the Harvard Youtube channel, or your own individual channel on Vimeo. If you need assistance with video production, the Office of the Vice Provost for Advances in Learning has created a list of groups and resources that can help you produce and edit instructional video. STEP-BY-STEP Guide: The Harvard Youtube Channel The Harvard Youtube channel features videos about life and learning taking place at Harvard – from lectures by faculty to vignettes about student life. The channel reaches a worldwide audience, with some videos receiving millions of views. You are encouraged to submit videos for consideration for the central Harvard Youtube channel, provided they meet the criteria listed below. You will then be able to embed the video into your OpenScholar website. Hosting is free. Vimeo If your video is not meant for wide public viewing, or if you only want the video to appear on your website, Vimeo may be a better option. Vimeo offers a free version that allows you to upload videos and use the embed code on your website. For $84 a year, the Vimeo Plus option provides the ability to completely hide the video so that it only appears on your website, along with more storage. Choosing the best option The suggested option depends upon the content of your video, production value, and intended audience, as detailed below. Follow the steps below to determine how to best host your video: 1. Content – Is your video: a. Of interest to a wide audience, and/or academic in nature? Examples include Harvard faculty lectures or research, panel discussions, or a showcase of student work. Yes, go to #2. b. Administrative, or for a very small audience. Examples include videos intended only for Harvard employees, training videos intended for a specific group of people. Yes, go to #5. 2. Visibility – Is your video: a. Content intended for a large audience, meaning anyone can watch it, including people outside of Harvard. Yes, go to #3. b. Content that is not intended for a large audience (should not viewable except on your website). Yes, go to #5. 3. Production value – Does the video have: a. High production value: video file is at least 640 x 360, audio is sync with the video, subject can be seen clearly (not pixelated), and lighting is adequate. Yes, go to #4. b. Lower production value: video size is smaller than 640 x 360, audio is out of sync, video is noticeably grainy, dark, or washed out. Yes, go to #5. 4. Video Format – Is the video: a. In a web-ready format (.MOV or MP4)? Yes, submit for consideration on the Harvard Youtube channel. b. In another format? Yes. First convert the video to .MOV or .MP4 following the compression guidelines, then submit for consideration on the Harvard Youtube channel. 5. Consider using Vimeo for your department’s video hosting needs. Try to consolidate the number of accounts if possible. For example, if your department has multiple websites with video, try to host the video in one central account. This will make it easier to keep track of your department’s videos. Keep in mind that in order for your video to meet accessibility guidelines, it should have captions. Read more about video captions and preferred vendors on the Harvard Online Accessibility site's Media Accessibility Resources and Vimeo’s documentation for creating captions. See more about accessibility in general on the Harvard Guidelines site."
Web Publishing & Hosting,Tracking Google Analytics (GA4) on your OpenScholar Website,"Starting July 1st, 2023, Google Analytics will stop tracking web traffic on Universal Analytics (UA), which is the old version of Google Analytics. They have instructed all users to migrate to the newest version, GA4. OpenScholar at Harvard is running on Drupal 7, which is not natively compatible with GA4. However there is a manual workaround to track your OpenScholar website traffic using GA4, before you transition away from OpenScholar. Instructions Creating the GA4 Property & Data Stream Sign in to your preferred Google account here: https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web Create a Google Analytics Account if you do not already have one, or do not have permissions to add more Properties to your current account.

Web Publishing & Hosting,How to launch your CampusPress site,"Guide of items to consider when launching your CampusPress website. Before Launch Quality Assurance Reviewing every page on your site before launch is helpful for catching last minute usability and accessibility issues. Here is a common, non-exhaustive checklist for common content quality and digital accessibility items to check for. There is also a built-in accessibility checker plugin that is enabled on your CampusPress site by default called Accessible Content, which will help catch some of these items–however manual review is also required. Broken links. Tip: use Ctrl/Cmd while clicking to open links in a new tab to more efficiently check for broken links. Using Siteimprove (see below) can scan for broken links after your site is live. Clear, specific link text. Do not use “read more” or “click here” for link text, or have repeating link text on the same page. Writing helpful links Links should not open in a new tab. This causes mobile and accessibility issues. The exception is if the link is a form or another interactive function. Alt text. Provide visual description of images for non-sighted site visitors. Write good alt text to describe images Heading structure / semantic markup. Use logical heading structure (e.g., Heading 2, Heading 3), mark bulleted or numbered lists, use tables for tabular data (not layout) and have proper heading rows/columns. Identify headings, lists, and tables Text formatting. Remove underlines from non-linked text and avoid use of italics (harder to read in a digital format) Content inaccuracy / misspellings Reading level. Website content should be written in clear, plain language. A common bar to aim for is a Sophomore in high school reading level Site structure. Breadcrumbs navigation / parent pages and menu item labels should be consistent / accurate Mobile view. Check a subset of pages to ensure proper stacking on mobile devices Read more about accessibility best practices on the Digital Accessibility Services website and sign up for the Digital Accessibility for Content Creators and Writing for the Web trainings. Make a copy of your old site Search to see if there is already a recent archive taken of your site on the Harvard University Archives. If not, request a scan from the library archives of your old site by emailing archives_wax@harvard.edu. You can also take advantage of tools like the Wayback Machine or Site Sucker to save html copies of your site, or simply copy over important content into Word or PDF documents. Domain For most sites, you can launch with the default URL, sites.harvard.edu/site-title. For some sites, such as for departments, labs, or other groups, you may want to request a new harvard.edu subdomain. For sites with an existing custom domain, you can submit a ticket to schedule the repointing of your domain to CampusPress. Request a new domain or use an existing domain During Launch Account for possible downtime for sites with existing domains Sites that are already live could have some downtime when switching the URL. It could be as little as 15 minutes, but could be a couple of hours. A new website could take up to 48 hours to fully propagate across the world wide web. Plan ahead by scheduling your site launch when you don’t anticipate higher than usual traffic. Change site visibility to public By default when your site is provisioned, it is set to “Discourage search engines from indexing this site”. For sites intended for the public, you should change your site visibility to “Allow search engines to index this site”. This will let Google and other search engines know that your content is ready to be indexed. If you are using the default URL or have a new domain requested, this can be done at any time after the domain is applied. If you are scheduling a site launch for an existing domain, HUIT will typically change this setting for you at the time of launch. This setting is found in the Dashboard > Settings > Reading. Read more on site visibility in CampusPress. Briefly review your site after domain is applied Do a brief click-through on the public facing view of your site to make sure the site is functioning as intended and links are working properly. If there are high trafficked pages that are broken (you can check immediately after launch on Google), you can request to enable the Safe Redirects Manager plugin to aid in the domain transition of your new site. After Launch / Maintaining Your Site Send out an announcement after a “soft launch” If you would like to announce your new website in an email blast or social media post, wait at least two days for the site to fully propagate. It is a good idea to wait at least a week to use as a “soft launch”, so issues can be caught before distributing to a wider audience. Siteimprove Siteimprove is a third-party service that scans your website for accessibility issues, broken links, misspelled words, and more. Request a Siteimprove account (HarvardKey required) and your site will be scanned periodically (roughly every few days). This tool helps with actively maintaining your site over time, particularly when you set up monthly reports. Setup Google Analytics Google Analytics can help you track web traffic to your site, and in CampusPress, some of that data can be pulled into the Dashboard of your site. Follow these instructions to set up Google Analytics for your CampusPress site. Submit to Google Search Console If your site is on the larger side, and you want to speed up the process of Google indexing or reindexing your site, you can submit your site to Google. Setup a new property in the Google Search Console and reach out to the CampusPress help desk to enable the plugin to verify site ownership. This step will not make a noticeable difference for small sites, and usually search engines index sites within two weeks. Managing Site Administrators It is the responsibility of the site owner or administrators to add and remove users who will manage the content of their websites. The site owner is the point of contact for the university about the website and this should be kept up to date as well. The site owner in CampusPress is labeled as the Site Administration Email Address, and can be found under Settings > General as found in this article. Please update this as there are staff transitions."
Web Publishing & Hosting,Transfer your OpenScholar website to a new administrator / owner,"It is the responsibility of the department, group, or person who owns or initially created the site to ensure proper transition and handoff of an OpenScholar site.

Web Publishing & Hosting,FAQ: Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use Site Removals for HMS-affiliated Site Owners,"What are the Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use? Why is my website not in compliance with the Terms of Use? Following a recently completed audit of all Harvard OpenScholar websites, Harvard University Information Technology (HUIT) has identified websites that do not meet its Terms of Use. HUIT has sent email notifications to site owners for one of the following reasons: You are a benefits-eligible Harvard employee or currently enrolled, degree-seeking student and it’s been over a year since your site was last updated. Under the Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use, sites that are not updated for more than 12 months are subject to removal. These sites are scheduled to be removed on Friday, January 20, 2023. OR Under the Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use, websites are available only to benefits-eligible Harvard employees or currently enrolled, degree-seeking students. Harvard web creation services are not available to individuals employed by hospitals or research institutions affiliated with Harvard Medical School. For those who are not eligible for a Harvard-managed website, these sites are scheduled to be removed on March 31, 2023. Additionally, please note that site owners who are not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar website are also not eligible for an hms.harvard.edu domain name, and it will be removed when the site is removed. What should I do if my site is not in compliance with the Terms of Use? Per #1 above, if you are eligible for a Harvard-managed website and your site has not been updated for more than 12 months, please review these options carefully and take the appropriate action: If you still need this site to remain active or if you believe this email has been sent in error, please complete this form as soon as possible. You will receive an immediate confirmation that your request has been submitted, and final advisement will be sent in the coming weeks (response time will depend on the volume of requests). If you no longer need your site but want to keep some of the site’s content, create a backup copy of files and other site content. If you no longer need your site and don’t want to keep any of the site’s content, you don’t need to take any action. We’ll remove the site and its content on Friday, January 20. Per #2 above, if you are not eligible for a Harvard-managed website, please review these options carefully and take the appropriate action: If you believe this email has been sent in error and you are a benefits-eligible Harvard employee or a currently enrolled, degree-seeking student whose site is still required for Harvard use, please complete this form as soon as possible. You will receive an immediate confirmation that your request has been submitted, and final advisement will be sent in the coming weeks (response time will depend on the volume of requests). If you want to keep any of the site’s non-proprietary content, you can manually copy and paste it to another website service or explore web hosting options at your current institution. This transition must be completed before Friday, March 31. For a list of web creation services contacts at each HMS-affiliated institution, visit the Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Affiliate/hospital-based community” + expansion. If you don’t want to keep any of the site’s content, you don’t need to take any action. We’ll remove the site and its content on Friday, March 31. Has Harvard changed its OpenScholar eligibility requirements? The Terms of Use, including eligibility requirements, specify that site creation is available only to benefits-eligible Harvard employees and currently enrolled, degree-seeking students. When users signed-up for an OpenScholar site they were required to attest to these terms of use. However, given the self-service nature of the Harvard OpenScholar platform, no gating mechanisms were put in place to prevent those who had a Harvard ID but did not meet the eligibility requirements from creating a site. I have updated my site and meet the eligibility requirements for site ownership. Do I still need to complete and submit the Terms of Use Site Removal Response Form? Yes, you still need to complete this form. This will help ensure your site is taken off the list of those scheduled to be removed, assuming that you are a benefits-eligible Harvard employee or you are a currently enrolled, degree-seeking student. You will receive an immediate confirmation that your request has been submitted, and final advisement will be sent in the coming weeks (response time will depend on the volume of requests). I’m employed at an HMS-affiliated hospital/institution. Are there web creation services available at my primary institution? Please reach out to your primary institution’s IT and/or communications team to determine what resources are available locally for website creation. For a list of appropriate contacts at each affiliate institution, visit the HMS Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Affiliate/hospital-based community” + expansion. Is Harvard able to export my OpenScholar website for me? Unfortunately, OpenScholar does not have an export capability. This is a limitation of the platform. If I am not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar site, can I keep my hms.harvard.edu domain name? If you are not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar website, you are also not eligible for an hms.harvard.edu domain name and it will be shut down when your site is removed. Visit the HMS Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Requesting an HMS domain” + expansion for eligibility criteria for HMS domain names. Is Harvard able to redirect my OpenScholar URL to a new location? Harvard is able to offer a temporary redirect of your old URL to a new URL for a period of 60 days. Note that this is only available at the top level. That is, any URL of the form https://youroldsite-url/some/sub/page would be redirected to https://yournewsite-url/. Please complete this form and use the Request Additional Assistance field. If I am not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar site, can I transfer my site to someone who does meet the eligibility requirements? Generally, no. In addition to the site owner needing to be eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar site, the content has to be relevant to the site owner’s individual academic pursuits at Harvard. For example, a faculty member employed at an HMS-affiliated institution would not be permitted to transfer their lab or project website to a currently-enrolled, degree-seeking student because the purpose of the site is broader than that student’s individual academic pursuits at Harvard. In addition, there is no ability to move an OpenScholar website in its entirety to another site. Therefore, if you are employed at an HMS-affiliated hospital/institution, please reach out to your primary institution’s IT and/or communications team to determine what resources are available locally for website creation. For a list of appropriate contacts at each affiliate institution, visit the HMS Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Affiliate/hospital-based community” + expansion. If I am not eligible for a Harvard OpenScholar site, can I use the Harvard University or Harvard Medical School logo on my new externally hosted website? Please refer to the Policy on the Use of the Harvard Names and Insignias, as well as the HMS Identity Guide. For those faculty and staff who are paid by and whose labs/programs are based at an HMS-affiliated hospital or research institute, websites should follow the branding guidelines of your primary institution. Please see the HMS Affiliate Identity Guide webpage for more information. If you have questions about the affiliate identity guidelines or design specifics, email design@hms.harvard.edu. Inquiries regarding proposed uses of the HMS name and/or logo must be shared for advance review by the HMS Use of Name Committee at UseofName@hms.harvard.edu. I was able to create an OpenScholar site, so does that mean I am eligible to keep it? The Terms of Use, including eligibility requirements, specify that site creation is available only to benefits-eligible Harvard employees and currently enrolled, degree-seeking students. When users signed-up for an OpenScholar site they were required to attest to these terms of use. However, given the self-service nature of the Harvard OpenScholar platform, no gating mechanisms were put in place to prevent those who had a Harvard ID but did not meet the eligibility requirements from creating a site. As part of a recent Harvard OpenScholar audit, Harvard University IT identified websites that are not in compliance with the Terms of Use and, therefore, whose associated costs and resources cannot be covered by the University. Notification emails were sent to site owners who do not meet the eligibility requirements, along with a timeline for removing these sites. I have had my OpenScholar website for quite some time. Can it be grandfathered in? There is no provision in the Harvard OpenScholar Terms of Use that “grandfathers” in any websites. Does Harvard need my consent to remove my site? Harvard reserves the right to remove sites that do not meet the Terms of Use. Please refer to the Termination and Changes section of the Terms of Use. I can’t access my site. What should I do? If you do not need to keep your site or any of its non-proprietary content, you don’t need to take any action. If you need to access your site to copy and paste any non-proprietary content, please complete the Terms of Use Site Removal Response Form. You will receive an immediate confirmation that your request has been submitted, and final advisement will be sent in the coming weeks (response time will depend on the volume of requests). If I have a Harvard Catalyst Profile page, can I edit it to include some of the information from my previous Harvard OpenScholar page? Harvard Catalyst “Profiles” creates searchable and interactive online profiles of all faculty at Harvard Medical School, Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. It is powered by the free, open source Profiles Research Networking Software (RNS). These pages are automatically populated for the more than 24,000 faculty, who can edit their own profiles to add education, awards, research narratives, website links, YouTube videos, presentations, and related content. Click here to search for your faculty Profile page, and visit the Harvard Catalyst Profiles webpage for more information on why and how to use this resource and to learn about its capabilities. Please note that Harvard Catalyst Profile pages do not provide the same level of customization as Harvard OpenScholar webpages. If you are looking for more customization and are employed at an HMS-affiliated institution, visit the Website Creation Support Models webpage and select the “Affiliate/hospital-based community” + expansion for the web creation service contact at your primary institution."

Web Publishing & Hosting,CampusPress Plugins and Functionality,"The Harvard Web Publishing (HWP) team takes a thoughtful and deliberate approach when it comes to adding new features and functionality in CampusPress, particularly when it comes to enabling plugins. Our goal is to provide a stable, scalable, and secure platform for all users while still allowing for customization and flexibility to meet the content needs of your site. With the release of the modern block editor (a.k.a, Gutenberg), the need for plugins in WordPress has significantly decreased. Some functionality (e.g., directory feature) is tied to the theme, while other functionality (e.g., text and image formatting) is tied to blocks. Using configuration options in the Dashboard, Customizer, and the 60+ block types available provide ample opportunities to customize your website and add extra functionality. However, there are certain features where plugin usage is the best approach. For each new plugin under consideration, HWP and the CampusPress team review for usefulness, maintainability, security, accessibility, and usability. We prioritize plugins that would benefit the larger CampusPress community, provide functionality that the theme or blocks do not currently provide, as well as those that are well-maintained, regularly updated, and have a large user base. While there are other plugins enabled in the background, the following are the plugins viewable to site builders in the Dashboard to activate: Accessible Content: A built-in accessibility checker that checks your pages and posts for potential accessibility issues Calendar+: An accessible events manager. Create, manage, and share your calendar and upcoming events Disable Comments Completely: Disables comments on posts by default Duplicate Posts & Pages: A quick way to duplicate or clone a page or post. Helpful for re-using complex page layouts Coblocks: Adds over twenty extra blocks to the block editor (some are excluded for accessibility reasons) WP SMO: Improves the way content is displayed when shared on a social media website Simple SEO: Quick and easy tool for building a solid foundation for an SEO-friendly website. Can be used to submit your site to the Google. Our team recommends using the configuration options available within the available plugins, the theme Customizer, and the block editor available to build out your site. The CampusPress help desk (contact@campuspress.com) is happy to help you navigate these nuances and find the best solution for your needs within the Harvard CampusPress structure."

Logged into VPN, received no error messages but cannot see my applications/servers This indicates that you have logged on to the default Harvard VPN tunnel but not your specific application/server tunnel. Please follow the instructions on how to connect to VPN found here. Slow Connection while on VPN Please note that the Cisco AnyConnect app routes all of your internet traffic through Harvard's networks, so the same policies for using Harvard's networks apply to a Harvard VPN connection at home. VPN is a technology that is used for securely accessing Harvard resources from outside of Harvard's on-campus networks. However, it can decrease the speed of your internet connection depending on a number of factors. This reduction in speed is due to the process of encrypting your internet traffic to make your transactions (of data) safe and secure. If you feel as though your connection is slower than expected, you can take some steps at home to check your internet speed and potentially determine a cause. How to Check Internet Speed To check your internet speed, remember to disconnect from VPN. Use https://www.speedtest.net or a similar online internet speed test. Ensure the test is from a reputable source. Once you click Go, the test will begin and you'll have your internet speed test results within a few moments. If you are starting with a lower speed internet, there is the possibility that you may face connection issues if connected to Harvard VPN for a majority of the workday. Try to lower the use of bandwidth when requiring the use of Harvard VPN on lower speed networks, including limiting streaming video and limiting the number of devices connected to your home network during that time. For issues installing on Mac OS High Sierra or Linx please see KB0015695 Need more help? If you would like assistance with VPN, contact your local Service Desk or, for HUIT-supported users, submit a ticket to the HUIT Service Desk via the IT Help Portal."

Wired & Wireless Networks,Initially Populate VPN Tunnels using Grouper,"This article describes the steps to initially populate VPN tunnels via Grouper and is intended for VPN Tunnel Administrators. As of May 2023, Harvard will use Grouper groups to manage who has access to each tunnel. This article augments the VPN Tunnel Administration using Grouper KB. Tunnel Administrators are responsible for initially populating their Grouper tunnel group(s) which grants them access to various servers and applications. Reference groups are read-only groups updated daily from HR and Student systems to contain only those with a current Harvard affiliation. When tunnel admins use reference groups, they will not need to self-audit their tunnel group when individuals join or leave the university because the update will be automatic. For security and audit purposes, using reference groups is the preferred and recommended method of populating your VPN tunnel group. Your tunnel group can include both reference groups and other users you manually add by name, if necessary. A video of what is covered below is available VPN Grouper Walkthrough Analyze your VPN tunnel users Before populating the tunnel group in Grouper, analyze who the users of the VPN tunnel should be. This will help in determining if there is a Grouper Reference group that can be used instead of adding users one by one to populate your tunnel group. Some questions to consider: Are employees included based on their department, or some other criteria such as employee classification of staff, faculty, etc.? Are Harvard Sponsored Roles such as consultants, contractors and vendors, to be included? Are students in a particular school to be included? A current student in the reference groups for students in a particular school is defined as students who are Registered, Pending, Study Abroad, On Leave Paying Facilities Fees, or in Special Program-SP. Are class participants included? Class participants are cross-registered students from outside and within Harvard, DCE students, and many Exec Ed program students. Determine if Department Reference Groups are appropriate Grouper already has Department-based reference groups for Employee and Harvard Sponsored Roles for each of the ~3,500 active HR departments. Each group is a rollup of all individuals within a department and any of its sub-departments. If your tunnel users are all in a specific department, or can roll up into a higher level department, then using a department reference group will alleviate the need for you to maintain the membership of your tunnel group. You may include multiple department reference groups in your tunnel group, as well as add individuals by name. To determine what departments your tunnel users are in: Take a sampling of current users in your tunnel and look them up by their name in the Harvard Web Directory. This will show their department name, e.g., CADM^HUIT^TPS^IAM. Determine if the departments from your sampling roll up into a higher level department that is appropriate to use instead of the individual departments, e.g., CADM^HUIT^TPS. Log into Grouper https://grouper.iam.harvard.edu/ and paste the department name into the search box in the upper right corner of the Grouper screen. The search results will show the department reference groups for the department you entered. Other groups may also show in the result set but the department reference groups are in the harvard:ref:dept: folder. Employee department reference group names begin with EMPL- Harvard Sponsored Role department reference group names begin with HSR- Note the department code that is appended to the reference group name, e.g., 104013. This code will make it easier to add the group to your tunnel group. Click on the department reference group to bring it up in the main Grouper window. Inspect the members listed and perhaps compare them with your current tunnel users in the noc portal. Use the back button on your browser to easily return to the search results. Determine if Student Reference Groups are appropriate Grouper has reference groups containing current students and class participants for each school. Navigate to the school folder in Grouper and open the students folder to view the available student and class participants reference groups for that school, e.g., harvard:ref:affiliations:schools:hds:students Click on the department reference groups to inspect the members of the group and perhaps compare them with your current tunnel users in the noc portal. If a desired reference group is not available you can request to have it created. Navigate to the VPN tunnel folder in Grouper In Grouper, under Browser folders, navigate to the VPN tunnels folder by clicking the folders harvard>apps>vpn>tunnels. Click on the “tunnels” folder to bring it up in the main Grouper window. See Navigate groups and folders in Grouper for more assistance. You should see one or more tunnel folders named “tunnel-#”, where # is the tunnel # which corresponds to tunnel names that you administer. See HUIT VPN tunnel name mapping for use with Grouper authentication if you do not know your tunnel number. Alternatively, you can search for your tunnel by entering the tunnel name in the Grouper search box, and then click on it in the search results to bring it up in the main window. Click on the “tunnel-#” folder for the tunnel you want to administer to bring it up in the main window. The tunnel name should be visible in the folder description. You should see 3 groups in the tunnel-# folder: vpn-admins-tunnel-# People in this group are administrators of the tunnel. They can manage the other two groups which determine who has access to the tunnel. They can also add/remove other tunnel administrators to this group. vpn-users-tunnel-#-members This is the group where reference groups and individual people are added/removed to in order to manage who has access to the tunnel. vpn-users-tunnel-# This is the group that is used in the HarvardKey registration. It intersects the vpn-users-tunnel-#-members group with a broad gencom tunnel members group to ensure that only those with an active Harvard affiliation can access the tunnel. Tunnel administrators do not need to edit or manage this group. Populate the VPN tunnel group with Reference group(s) Click on the vpn-users-tunnel-#-members group to bring it up in the main Grouper window. If the group is empty you will not see any names listed. Click the +Add members button. In the Member name or ID: box enter the department name (e.g. CADM^HUIT^TPS^IAM) or department code (e.g. 104013). You will see spinning ellipses as Grouper searches, and then a list of one or more matches. Do not press the “enter” button on your keyboard after entering the information. If you do then Grouper will give a “No matches found” error message. If this happens, simply backspace over the last character you entered and type it again to restart the search. The match list shows any group that includes the department name or department code. Use this information to select the correct department reference group. Select the group name beginning with EMPL- to add all employees in the department and any sub-departments. Select the group name beginning with HSR- to add all Harvard Sponsored Roles (e.g. consultants, contingent workers, vendors) in the department and any sub-departments. Keep the Default privileges selected and click the Add button to add the department reference group to your tunnel. See Add and remove people in Grouper groups for more assistance. Repeat this process to add additional department reference groups. To add any other reference group to the tunnel users group, follow the same steps as adding a department reference group, only in the Member name or ID: box enter ref: followed by a space and all or a portion of the reference group name (e.g. ref: HDS Students) and then select the appropriate group from the list provided. Starting the search with ref: will limit it to just reference groups. To see what other reference groups are available in Grouper, navigate groups in the harvard:ref:affiliations: folder. Note that the reference groups will be added with a Direct group membership, and the people in the reference group will be added with an Indirect group membership. Indirect members will be added and removed automatically as the department reference group is updated daily. You cannot manually remove indirect members of the group. If you cannot use a Reference Group to populate your VPN Tunnel You can either add people manually one by one, or you can export the current members of the tunnel in noc portal and then populate the VPN tunnel group using the Grouper import feature from a .csv file. Please remember that adding members to your tunnel by this method will require you to manually remove them should they no longer require access to the VPN Tunnel you administer. Add a person directly to the tunnel users group: Click the +Add members button. In the Member name or ID: box enter the first and last name, or HUID, NetID, or email of the person you want to add to the group. You will see spinning ellipses as Grouper searches, and then a list of one or more matches. Do not press the “enter” button on your keyboard after entering the information. If you do then Grouper will give a “No matches found” error message. If this happens, simply backspace over the last character you entered and type it again to restart the search. The match list shows the person’s preferred name, official email address, NetID, HUID, and other unique identifiers. Use this information to select the correct person from the list. People who have left Harvard will normally not display a Harvard email address. Keep the Default privileges selected and click the Add button to add the person as a member of the group. Repeat this process to add additional people as direct members of the group. Import current members of the VPN tunnel In the noc portal, create a .csv file containing only HUIDs of those you want to import into the Grouper tunnel group. Click on the vpn-users-tunnel-#-members group to bring it up in the main Grouper window. Click the Group actions button and select Import members from the dropdown. In How to specify members, select Import a file. Click Choose File, and select the .csv file from the noc portal export. Click the Submit button to add those in the .csv file to the group. See Add and remove people in bulk to Grouper groups using import for more assistance. Adding members via import will add people directly to the tunnel group and will require you to manually remove them should they no longer require access to the VPN Tunnel you administer. Review who is in the populated VPN tunnel group After adding all department or other reference groups, and any individual members to the vpn-users-tunnel-#-members group, you may have a long list of members displayed. The main window displays only the first 50 groups or people in the group. To navigate through the list of members click First, Prev, Next, Last at the bottom of the window. See Navigate groups and folders in Grouper for more assistance. In the Filter for: drop-down select Has direct membership, then click the Apply filter button. You will see the reference groups that have been added, and the names of people who have been added directly, or imported to the group. To see if a specific person is in the group: In the Filter for: option, click the Reset button to list all members of the group. In the Member name box, enter all or a portion of the person’s preferred name, then click the Apply filter button. Note: A person’s preferred name is what is seen in the Harvard Web Directory and may be different from their official name.

Storage,How to Get More Storage Space,"Overview
Disk space is online storage space. Stanford students, faculty, and staff are provided a variety of online storage options for their computer files. The information below gives you a quick description of AFS disk space and research disk space. There are links to the details on each of these storage systems.
Files are stored in AFS (Andrew File System). In AFS, your storage space works like the hard disk in your Mac or PC. You can store your computer files on AFS storage space but, instead of being inside your desktop computer, the files are stored in large computers (servers) across campus. There are many servers that effectively create one large storage system shared by thousands of users. You don't have to be sitting at your Mac or PC to access your AFS disk space; you can access it from almost any computer.
AFS disk space
All users with a full service SUNet ID get 5 GB of AFS disk space for storing web pages, text files, computer programs, and other forms of electronic information. This space is also referred to as ""disk quota"" or sometimes just ""quota."" This space can fill up fast depending on how you use it. It's important to monitor your disk space.
Personal AFS disk space
To check your personal AFS quota at the same time, log into a shared Stanford UNIX workstation and, at the command prompt, type:
check-stanford-afs-quota
Certain types of academic coursework requires extra disk space. Course instructors determine if an increase in disk quote is warranted. If you are granted a quota increase, when you finish the course your quota will drop to its previous level. These changes in disk space are reflected in your quota summary when you check quota online.
Students doing academic research projects can also be sponsored for more disk quota by the researcher or instructor for whom they're doing the work. If you feel that you qualify for more disk quota, you can fill out an AFS Space Request form.
To request more personal AFS disk space for other reasons, use the AFS Space Request form.
Group/Department disk space
AFS file space can be requested for groups that want a common place to store shared files. The guide lines for requesting group space is described on the  Group Request page. The form for requesting group AFS space is at the bottom of the page.
To check your group or department AFS quota, log into a shared computer with AFS installed and use the command ""fs listquota"" command.  For example:
 fs listquota /afs/ir/group/somegroup
To request more group or department AFS disk space submit a Help request detailing how much additional space you need and why you need it.
Research disk space
Researchers often have large data sets that must be stored.  Researchers with large storage needs can obtain extra disk space from University IT.  This space is not part of the main AFS system, but it is also easily accessed.  It is only available to Stanford faculty or students doing academic or non-sponsored research.  As you might imagine, this disk space is very popular, so be sure to request and reserve it before it is required.  To learn more, go to the Research Disk Space Request page.
 If you need large amounts of disk space for academic or unsponsored research, use the Research Disk Space Request form. 
Cleaning out your disk space
The time will come when you must clean out files you don't need now, but may need later.  For most people, this happens when they're about to leave Stanford.  There is no need to print out email or other documents.  The Information for Graduating Students  page has details on how to disconnect services and archive/store email and other files."
Storage,How To Make Box Drive Work Better for You (Stanford Medicine Box),"Purpose: This Knowledge Base article sets forth some optional best practices for assisting SoM customers who have their computer hard drive reaching its maximum capacity and wish to take advantage of Stanford Medicine Box (Box Drive).
Applicability: All Stanford Medicine TDS Field Support technicians and the Stanford Medicine Tech Bars. TDS Service Desk Consultants may also provide this information to customers who feel savvy enough to undertake the remedial action on their own.
Scenario: If a users hard drive is full or nearly full, here are some best practices about using and managing Stanford Medicine Box (SM Box) with Box Drive and aliases (shortcuts) to safely reduce the utilization on the local hard drive:

1. When you open Box Drive, there are only two folders you need to worry about. Other folders are ones that other users have shared with you. ""<Your Name>’s Files"" folder (contents can only be shared with others who have their SoM computers encrypted) and ""<Your Name>’s Externally Sharable Files"" folder (contents can be shared with any other Box user in the world). There must be no High-Risk data in the Externally Sharable folder or sub-folders. SM Box will catch these files and ask you to correct their location by moving them into your ""<Your Name>’s Files"" folder.
2. MOVE your least-frequently used folders to Box Drive. You can easily find and open them by double-clicking on the Box icon in your Applications folder or in your dock, then open ""<Your Name>’s Files"" folder or the ""<Your Name>’s Externally Sharable Files"" folder.
a. In Windows, Click+Shift+drag, and release = MOVE FOLDER/FILE to the new destination. Click+Control+drag will force a COPY between local folders on the same drive.
b. In Mac, drag, and drop to Box Drive results in a MOVE. In Mac, Click+Option+drag will force a COPY between local folders on the same drive as well as to BoxDrive folders. As always, you can right-click on the file/folder and select Copy and then go to the destination and right-click in the destination folder and select Paste.
You can hold the Control key to select multiple files with the cursor and then drag them as above.
3. MOVE your most-frequently-used folders from your local Mac (on Desktop, Documents, etc.) to Box Drive, and then create desktop aliases (shortcuts) to them. Take time to determine which folders you access most frequently during a typical week. 
(In Mac) Click+Command+Option+drag and release = CREATE ALIAS OF FOLDER/FILE in the new destination.
(In Windows) Click+Control+Shift+drag and release = CREATE SHORTCUT OF FOLDER/FILE in the new destination. When you click on the alias (shortcut), you can open the folder quickly, just as if it were on your desktop.

4. Make aliases (shortcuts) of Box Drive folders within your Documents Folder, Downloads Folder, or other folders so that you can quickly move old, less frequently used documents into Box Drive on the fly.
For example, I have a folder in BoxDrive named ""Box-Documents."" I made an alias of that folder within my Documents folder on my Mac. Then, I can Click+Shift+drag (in Mac, just drag-and-drop) files/folders and drag them to the alias to quickly MOVE them into Box Drive. That trims down the size of my Documents folder to the essential ones that I work with the most. Next, you must decide whether to move some or all of the files/folders up into Box Drive. Some folders HAVE to be in the Documents folder in order to have a related application (such as Outlook) work properly.
NOTES: Box Dive will cache up to 25%—remembers which files you use frequently—to allow for quick opening. Infrequently used files will take slightly longer to open. The web version of SM Box (https://stanfordmed.box.com) keeps versions of documents that are modified/updated which you can recover in case something gets overwritten accidentally. Click the version box icon  to the right of the file name to disclose the versions.

Storage,Frequently Asked Questions about Wasabi,"These questions provide information about the Wasabi Cloud Storage service offered by UIT.What is Wasabi?
	Wasabi is a popular cloud object storage service. It’s designed to be 100% compatible and interoperable with the Simple Storage Service (S3) available from Amazon Web Services (AWS). Consider Wasabi as a drop-in replacement for S3 when designing cloud-based solutions.
	What are the benefits of Wasabi over alternatives?

		Lower and more predictable costs

		Using cloud object storage from Amazon, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure results in charges for transactions with your data. Common and necessary operations, including transitioning between storage tiers, retrieving data, restoring files, and deleting data ""early"" resulting in penalties, make it challenging to predict your monthly costs. Cloud vendors’ calculators are frustrating to use, and misjudgments can be expensive.

		Wasabi charges for only two activities: the month-to-month storage of data and early object deletion before 30 days. You are not charged:
		data ingress or egress feesAPI operational or transaction fee (e.g., for using GET, PUT, or transitions)tiering (i.e., there is only one tier of storage — hot storage)early object deletion after 30 days (reduced from 90 or even 365 days used by other cloud storage services)

	As a result, Wasabi is substantially less expensive than comparable alternatives.


		Network performance and high availability

		Stanford uses their West Coast (Oregon) data centers, which provide 99.999999999% object durability.

		Security and compliance

		Like other Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers, Wasabi employs a shared-responsibility model for comprehensive data security and privacy. They maintain the infrastructure, provide automatic encryption of all storage at rest and require TLS when transmitting over a network. Wasabi maintains data centers that are highly secure, fully redundant, and certified for SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance. They also meet the infrastructure requirements for various compliance regimes, including HIPAA, HITECH, and FERPA.

		The shared-responsibility model imposes data protection measures on the users of these services. The university’s Minimum Security Standards outline these actions and apply to everyone in the Stanford community. Enabling encryption of data prior to leaving the source helps protect Moderate and High Risk data from unauthorized access. Stanford Single Sign-On (Shibboleth) with two-factor authentication is a feature when accessing the Wasabi web console.

		Reduced data retrieval delays

		Wasabi offers only hot storage, without the lengthy retrieval times usually associated with cold or archive storage tiers.

		Versioning and immutability

		Options for versioning and immutability are available.


	NOTE: The service does not include support for backups or data transfers, but UIT provides a free consultation to help match clients with professional technology service providers on campus.
	What are some examples of ways I might use Wasabi?

		Backup and recovery target destination

		One of the most common uses for cloud object storage is to be the target destination for commercial backup and recovery software, like MSP360 (formerly CloudBerry Backup), CommVault, Cohesity, and Veeam. Popular free and open source backup and recovery software like BorgBackup, restic, duplicati, and Bacula works with Wasabi, too.

		Serve and store digital content

		Wasabi can be integrated with your existing AWS EC2 virtual machines, too, just like native S3 storage. Digital assets like images and files can be hosted in Wasabi but served by your Amazon virtual machine. Compute services in Amazon can input and output data in Wasabi, too.

		Cloud-based Elastic File Service

		Enterprise services like ObjectiveFS can use Wasabi as a POSIX-compatible hierarchical file system with cloud object storage backend for use with AWS, Google Cloud Platform or on-premise compute clusters. Non-technical users can also use software like Mountain Duck or ExpandDrive to present an infinitely expandable virtual hard drive on their laptop, with caching, high-performance synchronization and offline access to frequently used files. Users can simply drag and drop their files to the virtual disk’s folders like a traditional file server.

University IT oversees all aspects of the Stanford ID Card and the Campus Card system, including developing new card services and deploying of new equipment for academic and administrative departments on campus.
The process of adding a card reader or point-of-sale terminal/reader involves the following five phases: 1) Specification, 2) Proposal, 3) Implementation, 4) Training, and 5) Support.
Specification
University IT will meet with department representatives interested in adding card services, determine their needs, and tour their facilities. Once a preliminary project scope is agreed upon, the Project Manager will consult University IT's Installation and Maintenance department, and, depending upon project scope, may also consult outside contractors including locksmiths, carpenters, electricians, etc.
Proposal
University IT will initiate an order to develop a detailed proposal including project scope, timelines, and costs. Upon acceptance by the department, a Support Level Agreement (SLA) will be presented which specifies all services and associated costs, including installation, ongoing support, training and maintenance.
Implementation
Once an SLA has been executed, University IT will place equipment orders, finalize an installation schedule, and oversee construction and installation of hardware including point-of-sale terminals, card swipers, door hardware and modifications, network connections, and data servers. University IT will also oversee installation of Campus Card System software, if appropriate, including any necessary system modifications.
Training
When all hardware, software, and construction is complete, University IT will perform a system walkthrough and will arrange initial training for department staff. When training is complete, University IT will turn the system over to the department.
Support
After University IT turns the system over to the department, the Stanford Card Office will provide support and other ongoing services including:
technical and user supportcentral Campus Card system data backupcentral Campus Card system monitoring, maintenance and administrationcentral Campus Card system software upgradessystem performance reviews, capacity planning, and change managementpreventative maintenancechanges and upgrades to department hardware/software, performed at the existing University IT service rates, andtraining of new/additional staff, performed at the existing University IT service rates.
Costs
A monthly charge is assessed on each installed card system device including door readers, entitlement readers, and point-of-sale devices, and for each network connection. New device connection, consultation to develop new applications, set-up of new schedules and privileges or changes to profiles, and additional training will be billed at existing University IT rates.
Fees are billed monthly, and will appear on your department's monthly University IT statement.

Research Computing,"Windows SSH reports ""message authentication code incorrect""","What is the problem?
Using the SSH client on Windows 11, when you try connecting to some SSH servers, you might get an error that includes these messages:

Corrupted MAC on input.
message authentication code incorrect

Here is an example of the problem (the example uses the Command Prompt, but the problem also happens when using PowerShell):

This is due to a bug in Microsoft's build of the SSH client for Windows.
How do I fix it?
Until Windows provides an updated SSH client that fixes this problem, you can work around the issue by telling SSH to avoid the problematic code.
To install the workaround, you will need to create a file in the .ssh directory, in your Windows home directory.
To start, open a File Explorer window, starting at your Home:

Next, in the address bar, type %HOMEPATH% and press Enter:

Next, in your home folder, you should see a folder named .ssh.  If the .ssh folder does not exist, create it.  Go in to your .ssh folder.

Next, in the .ssh folder, create a new Text Document named config.txt.

Next, open config.txt, and copy/paste the following text:
Host *  # Disable the umac-128-etm@openssh.com MAC.  # LibreSSH (used by OpenSSH for Windows) has a bug in its implementation of  # UMAC-128-ETM, which causes connections to fail with the error  # ""message authentication code incorrect"".  # Source: https://github.com/libressl/portable/issues/603  # and HelpSU KB00019944.  MACs -umac-128-etm@openssh.com
It should look like this:

Save and close the file.
Finally, change the file's name from config.txt to config.  You will be asked if you are sure about changing the file extension; click ""Yes"".

Try your SSH connection again; it should work now."

Below the project phases, you'll see the main project information.
If the project is created from a demand, the Project Name will be copied from the Demand.
The Business unit will also have copied from the Demand, and if you create a new project, this field will default to your business unit.
Anyone in your business unit's project manager group can be assigned as a Project manager. The project manager will update all the information related to this project record.
Throughout the execution phase of the project, you will update the Status, or health of the project, before creating a status report. Updating the Status is critical because it appears on the project within your business unit's Projects Dashboard.
The Phase field should be updated as you move from one project phase to the next.
The Project number is the ServiceNow assigned project reference ID.
You can update a project's Percent complete manually, or if you are using project tasks, it will update automatically based on the completion of each task.
The State field differs from the project phase. State notes if a project is pending, open, a work in progress, or closed. The state selections are universal in the ServiceNow system and cannot be modified.
The State of a project is determined by the current project phase:
Initiation and planning phase: ""Open.""Execution phase: ""Work in Progress""Complete: ""Closed Complete""

Planned duration will automatically be calculated based on the project start and end dates.
Planned effort is the projected amount of time spent on the planned tasks.
Actual start date, Actual end date, and Actual duration are automatically calculated based on the actual length of time spent on planned tasks.
Actual effort is automatically calculated by actual time spent on project tasks.
Planned/Actual Go-Live Date is a Stanford field to track when the expected delivery of a project will be. This may differ from the planned end date as there are often post-go-live tasks to be completed on a project.
Details tab
The details tab contains Portfolio, which will default to your business unit's portfolio, Program, and other configurable fields for your business unit, such as Project classification, Stanford entity, Sponsoring department, and Interested campus partners.
Project complexity is a Stanford field to track how complex a project is expected to be.
Depending on the type of project, you can update the Execution type to waterfall, agile, or a combination of the two: hybrid.

Once the demand has entered the qualified state there is no further action needed by the Demand Manager unless changes need to be made to the demand record.
At this stage, it is ready for PPM governance – this is the group or committee within your organization that will approve and prioritize projects.
Qualifying a Demand 
Click  ‘Qualify.’
Approving a Demand 
If a demand is not approved, you can defer it. A demand that is deferred can be sent back to a draft state or approved at a later date.
If a demand is approved, resource plans (see Resource Management) should be confirmed, and the demand should be approved and converted to a project.
To approve a demand:
Click ‘Approved.’"

Project Management Tools,Project Portfolio Management (PPM) - Project Resource Management,"There are several tasks that need to be completed before closing a project. These include:
Reviewing and completing all project resource plans.Creating a final project status report.Updating the actual end date.
Project Resource Management
Project Resource Management is the process of planning, organizing, scheduling and managing a project's resources, such as people. A resource plan is a reservation for a person’s (or group’s) time.
Project managers (PM) can create resource plans and specify the group or user resources required to complete deliverables for the project. Additionally, they verify resource availability and make changes to their resource plans before requesting resources.
Resource managers can view the requested resources' availability, existing allocations, and utilization and allocate resource plans.
Resource Plan States

Resource plans for a project should almost always be in a “Confirmed” or “Allocated” state. This is important because resource plans NOT in a “Confirmed” or “Allocated” state (i.e., Planning or Requested state) are not reflected in resource capacity analysis/reports.
State Description Planning or Requested
Resource plans will be in one of these states temporarily if you have:
created a new resource plan and you are communicating with the people manager to verify that the staff member has availability; ormade a copy of an existing resourcepPlan (see Copy a Resource Plan)
You can modify resource plans in these states (e.g. to increase the % FTE, change the resource Type from ‘Role” to “User”, change the plan duration, etc.).
Confirmed
All resource plans that come over from the Demand should be in a “Confirmed” state. These resource plans were vetted during the Demand process, but project managers should vet them again when beginning a project.
You can modify resource plans that are in a “Confirmed” state.Once you've made changes, you should then allocate the resource plan.
Allocated
Allocated resource plans have been verified and are ""locked in.""You cannot modify allocated resource plans. 
If you need to change an allocated resource plan, see Modify an Allocated Resource Plan for instructions."
Project Management Tools,Demand Operations Dashboard in Project Portfolio Management (PPM),"A useful tool for Demand Managers is the Demand Operations Dashboard — a working queue where demands are broken down into several categories. This queue should be checked regularly by Demand Managers to ensure that the highest priority demands are being addressed and moving forward in the PPM process.
Active Demands by Sponsoring Department - A quick view of active demands by the sponsoring department.All Demands by State - A snapshot of all demands by state (Draft, Submitted, Screen, Qualified, Approved, Deferred, Rejected, Completed).Various exception reports appear on the left side and can be modified as needs evolve. These include:
Demands that are APPROVED with UNCONFIRMED resourced plans.Demands that are still pending approval and the desired start date is less than 30 days away.Demand drafts that are more than seven days old.Active Demand w/Active Project demands ready to be transitioned into the Completed state."
Project Management Tools,Demand Manager tasks in Project Portfolio Management (PPM),"Once a demand is submitted, the Demand Manager works with the Demand Owner to ensure that as much helpful information as possible is entered into the demand — details can aid in a demand being qualified and considered for approval.
Most of the Demand Manager work happens between Demand Submit and Demand Qualification. Some of these tasks include:
Ensuring the business case and solution overview make sense and are complete.Helping identify and adding collaborators to the demand.Coordinating conversations between the demand manager and people managers to ensure staff is available for the project.Creating resource plans and requesting staffing for the project.

Email,Service Information for Graduating Students,"Overview
The page provides information for graduating students, including a brief breakdown of UIT services after graduation. It covers UIT services access immediately after graduation, the first 120 days after graduation (known as the 120-day grace period), and after the 120-day grace period, and details on forwarding and saving your @stanford.edu email. Additionally, it includes instructions on disconnecting in-room network connections and information about optional services, such as Cable TV.
Services timeline
Upon Graduation

Your account enters a 120-day grace period.
You can continue using your @stanford.edu email.
Library e-resource access is discontinued immediately after graduation.

During the 120-day grace period

You can continue using your @stanford.edu email.
You still have access to Google Suite, VPN, and Zoom conferencing. 

After the 120-day grace period

Your account will change to a base level account.

Base level accounts have different access privileges, for example, you will have access to VPN, Zoom, and Google Workspace (ID only), but not Google Suite.
View the SUNet IDs in Detail webpage for more information about service access for base level accounts after graduation.


Access to your @stanford.edu email and other services will expire.
Any remaining emails on the university's mail servers will be deleted.
If you qualify for an alumni account, any new emails sent to your @stanford.edu address after it closes will automatically be forwarded to your @alumni.stanford.edu address for two years.

See the Closing your SUNet ID Account web page for details. 



Update your email
Set up a permanent email address
After the grace period, your account will transition to a base level account, which remains active for five years. This provides access to your transcripts and other online information, but does not include @stanford.edu email.
The Stanford Alumni Association offers free and permanent email accounts to all graduating seniors or students who have completed three quarters or more in a degree-granting program. Membership in the alumni association is not required to receive this account. During signup, you can choose your username (name@alumni.stanford.edu), giving you a professional, Stanford-branded email address for life.
If you set up your alumni account before the end of the 120-day grace period, new emails sent to your @stanford.edu address will forward to your @alumni.stanford.edu address for two years. We recommend using your alumni email with friends since it is a permanent address.
To learn more and sign up for an alumni email account, visit the Stanford Alumni Email Account webpage. For instructions on migrating your student @stanford.edu Gmail and data to your alumni account, see Migrate Your Student Email to Your Alumni Account and Back Up Your Student G Suite Data.
Set up email forwarding 
About four months after you graduate, Stanford automatically forwards your @stanford.edu mail to your alumni email address. The university keeps this forwarding in place for two years. However, University IT (UIT) recommends initiating the forwarding process yourself to ensure received emails are successfully transferred.
Before you start migrating your mail, forward your @stanford.edu mail to your alumni email address so you only have to migrate your mail once.

Go to Stanford Accounts.
Select the Email Management tile and then click the Forward email tile.
Follow the onscreen instructions.We recommend that you select Do NOT keep a copy stored in your @stanford.edu mailbox. 

Note: To forward your @stanford.edu email to your Gmail account, please submit a Help request.
Set an autoreply message
You can inform senders of your new email address by setting up an autoreply message. 

Go to Stanford Accounts.
Select the Email Management tile.
Click the Manage Autoreply tile. You will be redirected to your Stanford email (Microsoft 365 or Gmail) account to set up your autoreply message.

Review these step-by-step instructions if you need assistance with setting up automatic replies in Stanford email (Microsoft 365 or Gmail).



Save your stored email

If you use POP, your email is already saved on your computer; no further action is required.
If you use IMAP, be sure that your email and attachments are cached on your machine. To check this, set your email client to work offline and then make sure you can still get to all your email and attachments. If you can't see your messages and attachments offline, refer to your email program's documentation for how to change the caching setting.
If you use POP to your AFS space (mutt or Alpine), your email is stored in the /Mail folder there. Use OpenAFS to mount your home folder, then either use a desktop email client (e.g., Apple Mail or Outlook) to import the email from the /Mail folder, or just copy the files to your local computer's hard drive.
If you use Webmail, you will have to install a desktop client (e.g., Apple Mail or Thunderbird) and use POP to download all your email to your local computer's hard drive. See Configuring Your Email for instructions on how set up your email client.

Move your files from your AFS space
Use OpenAFS for Stanford to mount your home folder, and copy the files from your home folder to your hard drive. If you don't have OpenAFS installed, use an SFTP client such as SecureFX (Windows) or Fetch(Mac) to transfer the files.
Close your AFS website
If you've put a personal web site at your www.stanford.edu/~sunetid address, you may want to use the grace period to redirect people to another web site. You can do this just by placing a link to your new site on your Stanford site's home page, or by using this <head> tag:

<meta http-equiv=""refresh"" content=""5;URL=https://www.mynewsite.com"">
This will cause most browsers to automatically display the specified URL after a delay of 5 seconds (or any number of seconds you specify).

Your website files are stored in the /WWW folder of your AFS home folder. Use OpenAFS for Stanford to mount your home folder, and copy the files from your home folder to your hard drive. If you don't have OpenAFS installed, use an SFTP client such as SecureFX (Windows) or Fetch (Mac) to transfer the files.
If you have questions, please submit a Help ticket.
Close your Stanford Sites website
To remove your personal website at people.stanford.edu/sunetid, submit a Help ticket. You have the option of requesting an offline archive of your website.
Disconnect your in-room network connection
Remember to disconnect your in-room network connection. While it may take a day or two for your RCC to process your disconnect request, it could be processed more quickly, so we recommend that this be the last thing you do before you are ready to pack up your computer and move out."
Email,How to Migrate Your Student Microsoft 365 Email to Your Alumni Account,"These instructions are for moving student Microsoft 365 email. If you are unsure as to whether your @stanford.edu mail account is hosted in Microsoft or Google, open a browser and visit webmail.stanford.edu. Your email will display in either Microsoft Outlook or Stanford Google Mail.
To migrate your email you'll need to use a desktop email client such as Apple Mail or Microsoft Outlook.  See the Microsoft 365 Configuration Instructions for information about setting up your email client.
You'll need to configure your alumni email account for IMAP. This allows you  to migrate your mail with folders and labels intact.
Forward your @stanford.edu mail
About four months after you graduate, Stanford automatically forwards your @stanford.edu mail to your alumni email address. The university keeps this forwarding in place for two years.
Before you start migrating your mail, forward your @stanford.edu mail to your alumni email address so you only have to migrate your mail once.

Go to Stanford Accounts.
Click the Email Management tile, then click Forward email.
Follow the onscreen instructions.We recommend that you select DO NOT keep a copy stored in your @stanford.edu mailbox.

Migrate your @stanford.edu mail
Step 1. Create a Google account password for your alumni account.
To use IMAP with an email client, you need to use a Google account password instead of your SUNet ID password. If you have not yet done so, create a Google account password for your alumni account. Use the following link  to log in to your alumni account to set your password:

Stanford Alumni Association: https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/my-account/profile/alumni-email/edit/

Notes:

Your Google account password must be different from your SUNet ID password.
If you change your Google account password during this process, be sure to change it on any mobile device previously set up to use the previous password. 

Step 2. Enable IMAP on your alumni account.
Use the following link to log in to your alumni, then enable IMAP  using instructions provided by Google.

Alumni account:

Stanford Alumni Association: https://alumni.stanford.edu/tools/mail?level=12



Step 3. Configure your desktop email client.
Alumni account: Configure your desktop email client for an IMAP connection to your alumni account. Use the following email address to configure the connection:

Alumni account email address: AlumniUsername@alumni.stanford.edu
If you see a ""Password incorrect"" error when trying to sign in with your Google account password, you may need to change your account access settings.  Go to www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps and change Access for less secure apps to Turn on.

Student account: Configure your desktop email client for an Microsoft 365 connection to your Stanford account.

Student account email address: SUNetID@stanford.edu

Use the following instructions to configure the connection:

If you use a computer running macOS and use Apple Mail, launch Apple Mail and follow the Apple Mail for Microsoft 365 configuration instructions.
If you use a computer running macOS  and use Outlook, launch Outlook and follow the Outlook for Mac Microsoft 365 configuration instructions.
If you use a computer running Windows, launch Microsoft Outlook and follow the Outlook for Windows Microsoft 365 configuration instructions .

Step 4. Migrate your mail.
To migrate your mail, you need to make two concurrent connections, one to each account. Use your @stanford.edu account for the first connection and your alumni account for the second connection.
Note: Using drag and drop to migrate your mail is not recommended. You could lose your mail if an interruption occurs.
Once you have set up your connections to both of your two email accounts, use your email client's Copy function to copy mail from your Stanford account to your alumni account. If you use a different mail client than the ones referenced here, you may need to re-create your folders or labels manually.
Tip: If you have a lot of mail to migrate, try copying it in blocks of a few months or a year at a time. Do a test block of a few months . Then, increase or decrease the size of the next blocks depending on how long the test block took to copy.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to allow sufficient time for your mail migration to complete.

If you are using Apple Mail, click Window, then click Activity to ensure that all messages have migrated.
If you are using Microsoft Outlook, click Send/Receive, then click Show Progress to ensure that all messages have migrated.


Step 5. Exit your email client.
After you have completed the migration of your email from your Stanford account to your alumni account, close both connections and exit the mail client.

Email,Can I have POP access enabled so I can access by Stanford mail in my personal Gmail account?,"No. The type of authentication Gmail does for POP connections is not compatible with Office365's current security requirements.  In addition, such a setup would be incompatible with the compliance requirements for handling secure email. An alternative option is discussed below.
University IT does not recommend managing your Stanford email through a personal Gmail account, and we have very limited support available for those who choose to set up their email this way.
For those that wish to do so anyway, the process looks like this:

Email,How Secure Email Works,"Overview
Secure Email is designed for faculty and staff who need to send Moderate or High Risk Data via email.
Any messages sent through the primary group of outgoing mail servers with the word ""Secure:"" somewhere in the Subject line of the message — it doesn't matter if it's at the beginning, middle, or end, as long as it's there somewhere — will be processed by the Secure Email service.
The service uses two different methods to insure the messages it handles are delivered securely.  The method used depends on the destination address where the message is delivered:


Mail sent to Trusted Domains
Some internal email systems have been designated as ""Trusted Domains"" for Secure Email purposes.  Communication to and from these systems is guaranteed to be encrypted, so the messages can securely pass through to those systems like any other email message.
The following have been designated as trusted domains: stanford.edu (provided the account has not been forwarded to an external or departmental address), stanfordhealthcare.org, stanfordchildrens.org.


Mail sent to Untrusted Domains
Messages that are sent to addresses that are not a member of a trusted domain (including @stanford.edu addresses that are forwarded to external or departmental addresses) are encrypted and sent to the recipient as an attachment.  The recipient must open the message and enter the password that they created when they registered their email address with the Cisco Registered Envelope Service (CRES).





Sent From
Delivered To
Result


@stanford.edu, @stanfordhealthcare.org, @stanfordchildrens.org
@stanford.edu, @stanfordhealthcare.org, @stanfordchildrens.org
The message opens normally and recipient can read it right away without having to enter another password.


@stanford.edu, @stanfordhealthcare.org, @stanfordchildrens.org

Stanford email that is forwarded — either to a department server or to an external account such as Gmail
Non-Stanford email account


The message is encrypted when it leaves the Stanford trusted domain and appears to the recipient as an email attachment. Recipients need to enter a password to access the message.



Recipient (external to Stanford) replying to or forwarding a secure message
@stanford.edu, @stanfordhealthcare.org, @stanfordchildrens.org
As long as ""Secure:"" is somewhere in the Subject line of the message, the message is sent securely.



Tips

The way for a Stanford recipient to tell whether a message was sent using the Secure Email service is to look for ""Secure:"" somewhere in the Subject line. If ""Secure:"" is in the Subject line, the email was routed through the Secure Email server.
Stanford senders should always include ""Secure:"" in the subject when sending Moderate or High Risk Data via email. Even if the original message is sent to a presumably trusted domain, the sender cannot be sure of the automatic mail-forwarding settings of the recipient. Including ""Secure:"" in the subject ensures that the message will be encrypted if the recipient's mail leaves Stanford's trusted set of domains.
You do not need to register your Stanford Email account (or that of other trusted domains such as @stanfordchildrens.org or @stanfordhealthcare.org) in order to read secure email. It arrives in your Inbox as any other message. Email sent within the Stanford email system is already encrypted.
If you believe you are receiving secure email through a Stanford Email account but the messages appear as encrypted attachments, the messages have left the Stanford Email and Calendar service. It's possible that you are receiving your Stanford email via a department server using an alternate address.(Symptom: You can see the email in webmail, but not in a desktop client.) Please contact your local IT Support for more information about your final destination address.
To reduce the risk of unauthorized access to Stanford University High Risk Data, email that contains High Risk Data may only be received on Stanford mail servers. If, in your role at Stanford University, there is any chance that you might receive High Risk Data via email, please do not have your email forwarded automatically outside of the Stanford Email account system. For example, you should not forward your Stanford email to a Gmail or Yahoo email address. Take a moment to check StanfordYou to confirm your settings."

Email,Frequently Asked Questions about Modern Email Authentication,"Will I be prompted for two-step authentication every time I use my email?

You will be prompted every time you log in to your email and the first time you configure your email client or app.
How long will this change limit my email access on my laptop, desktop computer, VDI, or mobile device?
The change should take up to one hour. If your email stops working and does not start re-downloading within an hour, you should delete your mail profile from your device and reconfigure it. Configuration instructions for Windows or Mac desktop clients, iOS devices, Android devices, and Linux are available on the Microsoft 365 Configuration Instructions webpage. This varies by device. In many cases access will be limited for a few minutes or hours; in rare cases it may be limited for several days.
How might my mobile device, laptop, or desktop be affected by this change?

How the change affects you depends on how your devices are configured. To implement the change on email applications installed on your computing devices (e.g, Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird), your email configuration may need to be updated. If your email client is already configured for modern authentication, you will not notice any change when your account is updated. If you have difficulty accessing your email after the change, you will need to manually reconfigure your email. Configuration instructions are available on the Microsoft 365 Configuration Instructions webpage. If reconfiguration does not resolve the problem, please submit a Help request.
Here’s what to expect if you access your email on your mobile device, laptop, or desktop:

iOS: If your iOS device is enrolled in Stanford's Mobile Device Management (MDM) (also called AirWatch) and meets the minimum system requirements, this change should happen automatically within an hour of the time that is specified in your notification. If your iOS device is not enrolled in MDM, and you have an issue with your email after the time the change is scheduled, you may need to reconfigure your email manually.
Android: Whether or not your Android device is enrolled in MDM, if you have an issue with your email after the time that is specified in your notification, you may need to reconfigure your email manually.  
Laptops, desktops, and VDIs:

If you use Windows, in most cases this change should happen automatically within an hour of the time that is specified in your notification.
If you use macOS and you purchased your device within the last two years, in most cases this change should happen automatically within an hour of the time that is specified in the notification.
If you use Linux and you have difficulty accessing your email after the transition time that is specified in your notification, you may need to reconfigure your email manually.




I use Cardinal Key to log in. How will this affect my email during the change?
Cardinal Key has no effect on the email change.
Will this affect my email messages or calendar appointments?
No email or calendar items will be lost. While your device redownloads your information, you can access your appointments and emails online through Webmail (webmail.stanford.edu).
What Microsoft 365 features will be affected by this change?
This change affects your email and calendar, which will all be accessible online through Webmail (webmail.stanford.edu) during the change. OneDrive is not impacted.
Will I need to re-download my desktop client for Outlook?
No, you do not need to re-download the desktop client.
How do I use Webmail?
To use Outlook on the web (Webmail), the web-based email client for Microsoft 365, open a web browser and go to webmail.stanford.edu. Authenticate with your SUNet ID and SUNet ID password."
Email,IMAP/POP Access,"Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol (POP) are protocols that allow you to store email messages on a mail server and then download and view the messages as though they were stored locally on a computer or device. IMAP allows users to see all mail folders on the server while POP only allows users to see the Inbox. Additionally, POP removes the emails from the server and stores them locally, while IMAP leaves the messages on the server.
IMAP and POP are not automatically enabled for university email accounts because they do not support two-step authentication.
IMPORTANT: To enhance the security of your Stanford email account, on October 31, University IT (UIT) disabled the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol (POP) for accounts that do not use these methods.
Two-step authentication support
The move to disable IMAP and POP where it is not used is part of an effort to ensure that two-step authentication is used whenever possible for accessing email. IMAP and POP do not support two-step authentication.
The following applications offer two-step authentication and are approved for use at the university:

Webmail
Outlook 2016 for Windows and Mac

Change impact
This change will have no impact on your ability to access your email.

Accounts that access email via webmail only will not experience any change.
Accounts that use IMAP or POP (or have within the past six months) will continue to have access to these protocols.

IMAP and POP will be disabled for accounts that have not used IMAP or POP in the past six months.

If, at some time in the future, you need access to IMAP or POP, you can request that the appropriate protocol be re-enabled quickly by submitting a Help ticket."

Secure email sent to your Stanford Email account (or that of other trusted domains such as @stanfordchildrens.org or @stanfordhealthcare.org) arrives in your Inbox like any other email message. Communication to and from these systems is guaranteed to be encrypted.
Messages received at any other domain will not show the body of the message, but instead will show an attachment. The first time you receive secure email from a Stanford Email account, you will need to register the email address in order to retrieve the message.
For subsequent messages, you only need to enter your password to retrieve your messages. You can submit a request to reset your password if you forget it."

Email,Microsoft 365 Known Issues,"Overview
Here are some known issues that may affect your experience.
The term Outlook refers to the Outlook desktop client while the term webmail refers to the web version.  Microsoft 365 refers to both.
New Webmail Issues
These issues were introduced following Microsoft’s update to Outlook for the Web in the Summer of 2019.
IssueWorkaroundAll appointments on shared calendars appear duplicated.Remove the shared calendar from your left hand column and re-add it by going to Import Calendar > From Directory. A support case has been opened with Microsoft in hopes they will provide a fix that doesn't require this step.Zoom plugin for Outlook on the Web does not appear when scheduling an appointment on a shared calendar.Begin by acting like you will create a meeting on your own calendar and click the Zoom plugin to add the Zoom information in the appointment *before* specifying which shared calendar will hold the meeting.Most or all print views from Outlook on the Web are incomplete, showing only the a few lines of the expected information.Use the desktop version of Outlook. Microsoft expects a fix by October 5th.Daily calendar will only print the current day's information—no ability to print the daily calendar for tomorrow, etc.Select the desired day in the mini calendar in the top left and then hit print.
Calendar issues
IssueWorkaroundYou notice missing calendar appointments, missing meeting updates, issues with accepting, declining, and sending meeting invitations, etc.Do not accept, decline, modify, or invite others to appointments from your mobile device. Calendar events should be treated as read-only on a mobile device.You have Free/Busy permissions to a shared calendar but the calendar won't open in Outlook for Mac or Apple Calendar.In order to access a shared calendar on a Mac client the calendar must be shared with a minimum of Reviewer permissions. See ""You do not have permission"" error message when you try to open a shared Calendar folder in Outlook for Mac for more information.Your  iPhone, OS version 9.1, is sending out multiple invitations or acceptances for meetings — both future and past.Turn off email and calendar syncing on your iPhone and then turn it back on. See How to Re-sync the iPhone or iPad Calendar for instructions.The email you receive after scheduling/accepting a meeting sometimes says that the meeting is scheduled using the UTC Monrovia, Reykjavik time zone instead of PST.This issue has been reported to Microsoft and they have acknowledged that it's a bug. It is not a high priority for them to fix, since the meetings are scheduled for the correct time and only some messages are incorrect.webcal.stanford.edu takes you directly to email view, not calendar view.From the Microsoft 365 settings, under Start Page, select the app you want to see when you open Microsoft 365.Sharing your calendar to non-Stanford affiliates is not working.We have a ticket in with Microsoft.  When it works, right-click your Calendar and select Share.  Enter the fully qualified email address and click share.  
Email issues
IssueWorkaroundSpell check - in webmail, there is no spell check.Use the browser's spell check from the Edit menu.Rules - in webmail, filtering a Stanford mailing list using the list name it was received from (i.e., stanfordstaffers) does not work.Create the rule using the mailing list's sent address (i.e., stanfordstaffers-bounces@lists.stanford.edu).When copying and pasting multiple addresses into the To: field, webmail does not recognize addresses if they are not in your contacts.Separate each address with a semicolon.
Other
IssueWorkaroundYou get an error when trying to log in to Outlook with single sign-on.If you have a personal Microsoft 365 account that was set up using your @stanford.edu email address, you may get  an error message or stuck in a perpetual loop when signing in to Outlook with two-step authentication. You need to rename your personal account.When you search for yourself in Microsoft 365, your name doesn't come up.If your email address or SUNetID are set to ""Private"" in StanfordYou (stanfordyou.stanford.edu), the GAL (Global Address List) in Microsoft 365 marks your record as private. If you change the settings in StanfordYou to ""Stanford"", you will be visible in Microsoft 365.How do you search by category in webmail?In the search box, enter category: <name of your category in Microsoft 365>""Sign out"" in Microsoft 365 doesn't fully log you out of your browser.To log out completely, quit this browser program when you are finished and log out of Network Identity Manager or Kerberos Commander."

Email,Mailing List Service Policies and Guidelines,"Policies
Stanford's Mailing List service is provided and maintained by University IT. To prevent misuse of this service, University IT reviews list names, list purposes, and patterns of use to ensure that usage conforms to established policies.
Please review these Mailing List policies before you begin using the service:
The @lists service is bound by the general Computer and Network Usage Policy as well as the Fundamental Standard. Please read these policy documents.Mailing list service usage is ""opt in"" by policy. This means that you must have the person's explicit permission to add their email address to your list.A list using @lists services is a privileged use, not a right. Lists may be shut down, have their address name modified, etc., by the administrators of the @lists system without the consent of a particular mailing list owner if resource usage, verifiable complaints, and/or eminent University business requires it.The mailing lists service is not recommended for automated alert notification. If you must use a list for alert or report notification, please be sure to set a conservative notification interval. To protect general use of the list service, a list that uses excessive resources, may, without notice, be shut down and excessive messages removed.A list owner is responsible for keeping list member addresses current and active and for managing issues with their list. Any list that fails to have an identifiable active Stanford community member as an owner/administrator may be shut down without notice.A list owner is responsible for providing first-level support to list subscribers. This includes assistance with subscribing to and unsubscribing from lists, and responding to questions about list policy and charter.The @lists system administrators do not monitor the system for content but will respond to complaints from list users/members if/as necessary.All lists at the @lists service should have a defined charter. A list without a defined charter (a charter can be placed in the list information file) may be subject to being shut down without notice based on general verifiable complaints.Spam mailing and/or repeated verifiable off-topic postings are potential grounds for removal from any and all @lists lists, including list ownership.The @lists service is not to be used for general bulk mailings, nor one-time use lists.
@lists lists are not to be used for non-University (i.e., unrelated) business. This service is a campus resource for the campus community.

Usage recommendations
Place a list charter within the list information file. Define the topical focus of the list and the general acceptable language level of the list (business only, personal discussion encouraged, etc.).Do not use mailing lists to distribute calendar invitations.Norms learned in a particular e-mail environment may not apply in general to your email communication with people across the Internet. Be careful with slang or local acronyms.Be aware of what you are sending (size, content, etc.) and to whom you are sending it. Sending someone mail may also cost them in other specific ways like network bandwidth, disk space, or CPU usage in ways that may or may not be costs that apply to you as a sender.Consider that a large audience will see your posts. That may include your present or your next supervisor. Take care in what you write. Remember that mailing lists are frequently archived, and that your words may be stored for a very long time in a place to which many people have access.
Assume that individuals speak for themselves, and what they say does not represent their organization (unless stated explicitly).
Messages and articles should be brief and to the point. Don't wander off-topic, don't ramble, and don't send mail or post messages solely to point out other people's errors in typing or spelling. These, more than any other behavior, mark you as a beginner.Attach a signature to your message. This will guarantee that any peculiarities of mailers which strip header information will not delete the only reference in the message of how people may reach you.
Don't send large files to mailing lists when links to the file will do. If you want to send multiple files, be sure to follow the culture of the group. If you don't know what that is, ask.
If you are caught in an argument, keep the discussion focused on issues rather than the personalities involved.Don't get involved in flame wars. Neither post nor respond to incendiary material.Avoid sending messages which are no more than gratuitous replies to replies.Be careful with monospace fonts and diagrams. These will display differently on different systems, and with different mailers on the same system.
Stanford's mailing list management services
Stanford offers two services for mailing list management. Google Groups mailing lists is the recommended service and will become the primary mailing list management service. Mailman is a legacy service. However, certain functionalities are currently only available in Mailman. Compare Stanford's mailing list management services to determine which one best meets your needs.

Email,How to Send Secure Email,"Notes:

The Secure Email service does not automatically insert the email into the official medical record.
Secure email that is sent to Stanford's mailing list service (@lists.stanford.edu) must be sent to a secure mailing list. Otherwise, it  will be rejected.See How to Set up a Secure Mailing List for more information.
Secure:  can occur anywhere in the subject line of your message but always include the colon. Secure:  is not case sensitive — you can use any combination of upper and lower case letters
 Email with ""Secure:"" anywhere in the subject line is routed through the Secure Email server unless it is going to a trusted domain (e.g., a Stanford Email account, @stanfordchildrens.org, @stanfordhealthcare.org). Trusted domains receive secure email directly without having to verify identity.
Any email containing High Risk Data must include Secure: somewhere in the subject line, however it is recommended, and good practice, to include secure: in the subject line of any message that contains Moderate Risk Data as well. While your intended recipient may have an @stanford.edu, @stanfordchildrens.org, or @stanfordhealthcare.org address, you do not know where the message will be automatically forwarded or manually resent after being read by the original recipient.
Do not put sensitive data in the subject line because the subject line is not secured.
If you reply to a secure email, your reply will be sent securely provided that  ""Secure:"" is somewhere in the subject line. You do not need to remove the ""RE:"" from the subject line.

To send secure email:

If you are sending a message using a desktop client such as Outlook or Apple Mail, verify that your client is configured correctly. See Configuring Your Email Program to check your settings. The Secure Email settings are the same as those for regular email.If you are sending a message using webmail, your settings are correct so no action is required.
Put Secure: anywhere in the subject line of the message and then continue typing your subject line. (Be sure to include the colon.)Example subject line: Secure: Regarding Your Appointment
Compose your message and send it as you would normally."
Email,Secure Email with Forwarded Accounts,"You do not need to register your Stanford Email account (or that of other trusted domains such as @stanfordhealthcare.org or @stanfordchildrens.org) in order to read secure email. It arrives in your Inbox as any other message. However, if you forward your Stanford email to another mailbox, you need to register the final destination email address. For example, if your email is forwarded from Stanford to Gmail and you want to read secure messages in Gmail, you need to register the Gmail address.

Note: If you believe you are receiving secure email messages through a Stanford Email account but they appear as encrypted attachments, the messages have left the Stanford Email and Calendar service. It's possible that you are receiving your Stanford email via a department server using an alternate address. Please contact your local IT Support for more information about your final destination address.

To register the final destination of your forwarded Stanford Email account:
Launch your email program and log in to the account to which you are forwarding your Stanford email.Open a secure email message. It will have ""Secure:"" in the subject line and will have an attachment.Open the attachment.Register your email address with Proofpoint Encryption."

Email,How to Create a Spam Filter in Office 365 Webmail,"Overview
You can create a spam filter to automatically filter or delete email that has been labeled as spam by the Stanford spam filters.
The number of ""#"" signs (pound or number signs) after the word ""Spam:"" indicates how sure the system is that your email qualifies as spam. By default, all email marked with five # symbols is discarded before it reaches your mailbox. All mail marked with four # symbols is filed into a folder labeled Junk Email that can be accessed via Webmail or an email program. Messages more than 30 days old are automatically purged from your Junk Email folder.
The following instructions show you how to create a spam filter that filters emails marked with three or more # symbols into the Junk Email folder. You can make the filter more sensitive to spam by choosing to filter messages labeled with one or two # symbols.
You can choose to have messages discarded rather than moved to the Junk Email folder. However, the Stanford spam filters are not perfect. Legitimate email occasionally gets labeled as spam. Such mail usually gets a ""[SPAM:#]"" or ""[SPAM:##]"" tag. If you do choose to discard messages tagged as spam, that email is gone forever and cannot be restored.
Creating a spam filter

If you haven't already done so, go to webmail.stanford.edu and log in to your webmail account.
Click Settings (the gear icon in the upper-right corner) > Options.
In the Options panel, navigate to  Mail > Inbox and sweep rules.
Under Inbox rules, click the plus sign (+) to add a new rule.
Enter the following information in the New inbox rule dialog box:

Name: Spam Filter (or whatever name you want to call this filter)
When the message arrives, and it matches all of these conditions: It includes these words  > in the subject...
Specify words or phrases: enter [SPAM:### and click the plus sign then click OK.
Do all of the following: Move, copy, or delete > Move the message to folder
In the  Select folder dialog box, select Junk Email and then click OK.
Stop  processing more rules: checked (this prevents additional filters from being applied to a message after the first match so as to avoid contradictory actions)


Click OK to save your spam filter.
If you see a warning message about using Outlook Web App or Windows PowerShell to modify your rules. Click OK to save your webmail spam filter."
Email,Data Loss Prevention (DLP),"Background
To protect the University from the financial penalties and loss of reputation that result from High Risk Data being inappropriately released, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) appliances have been incorporated into Stanford's email infrastructure. Currently, these look only for Protected Health Information (PHI) that matches hospital records from Stanford Health Care or Stanford Children's Health. When a match is found in an email that was not sent via Secure Email the message is blocked from delivery and the sender is notified via email. Only data that matches hospital patient records should cause a message to be blocked. This technology has been successfully deployed in the two hospitals since 2013.
Email messages that are blocked by the DLP appliances are retained for a period of time to allow staff from Stanford's Privacy Office or the Stanford IT organizations to improve the accuracy of the protection rules in place.
User notification
When an email is blocked, the sender receives an automated email informing them of the block. A sample message is below:

Subject: Email Message Blocked
An email that you just sent has been blocked from delivery because it appears to contain High Risk Data such as protected health information (PHI) or Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and was not sent via Stanford's secure email service.
When sending High Risk Data in the body of an email or as an attachment, always insert ""Secure:"" in the subject line to send the message securely.  While “secure:” is not case sensitive and can appear anywhere in the subject line, the trailing colon with no space between is required to trigger the secure email service.  See secureemail.stanford.edu for more information.
Please note that a copy of the blocked email will be retained and may be reviewed by staff from the University Privacy Office, Office of General Counsel, or the Information Security Office (ISO) for authorized investigations, or by University IT in response to user inquiries.
If you have any questions, please submit a help ticket via https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5174081613bce2008a9175c36144b0a9
For more information about Stanford’s data loss prevention (DLP) service for email, see dlp.stanford.edu.

Users can re-send the message, putting ""Secure:"" in the subject line in order to have it delivered.
Support
If you have any questions about DLP technology or need any information about why a specific message you sent was blocked please submit a Help ticket."
Email,Configure Apple Mail for Office 365,"These instructions apply to Apple Mail running on macOS X 10.14+. Please note that macOS 10.14 is no longer supported by Stanford or Apple but will technically work with modern authentatication. Before upgrading, you may want to review system checks to ensure a smooth macOS upgrade.
Follow these instructions to configure the Mail app to connect to your email and calendar events on the Microsoft Exchange server.

IMPORTANT: After configuring Apple Mail, be sure to change the Trash setting to never permanently erase messages. Otherwise, you won't be able to restore deleted messages.

Recommended setting
Office 365 accounts are not backed up. However, Outlook on the web and some desktop versions of Outlook let you recover deleted items that are no longer visible in the Deleted Items folder.
In Apple Mail you can set how long to keep messages in the Trash folder. Once a message is permanently erased in Apple Mail it cannot be recovered from the Deleted Items folder in Outlook on the web. We recommend setting Apple Mail to never permanently erase deleted messages.
In the Mail menu, click Preferences.In the Accounts pane, click the Mailbox Behaviors tab.

Web Tools,Office of Digital Accessibility Guide for Captions and Audio Descriptions,"Captions
Captions provide a text equivalent of the audio information of a video and are synchronized with the video presentation. Captions are an accessible alternative for individuals who cannot hear the content and includes the dialogue, speaker information, and any sound effects present in the video.
While the terms ""captions"" and ""subtitles"" are often used interchangeably, subtitles do not provide the same information and are designed for different purposes. Subtitles provide a text version of the dialogue only and often in different languages. Essentially, subtitles assume an audience can hear the audio but also need the dialogue provided as text.
Tips for captions
Include all spoken information as well as relevant parts of the soundtrack like background noises, sound effects, speaker identification, and any audio cues that help the viewer understand the video.Captions should be in the same language as the primary audio content.Use proper punctuation and grammar.

What videos need captions?
Videos promoting your program or attracting students, participants, and alumniVideos showcasing curriculum, research, exhibitions, or collectionsVideos profiling students, faculty, or researchersVideos providing instructions for how to apply or register for programsVideos listing news stories about your department or program
If you have questions about what types of videos to caption, please submit a Help Request. 
Captioning and live events
Before hosting a meeting or live event, please review the Digital Inclusion Checklist.
Auto-generated captions can include critical errors that impact the information or context of what is being communicated. A professional captioner has a higher level of accuracy compared to auto-generated captions but requires advanced scheduling to arrange for their service.
For assistance on real-time captioning as an accommodation, please submit a Help Request.
Zoom and captions
Zoom provides the capability of including captions from a professional captioner or to use auto-generated live captions from automatic speech recognition (ASR) engines. For live events that are not public-facing or in which there is no request for captioning services, follow these steps to enable the live transcription feature in Zoom:
As the host, go to Zoom Settings and In Meeting (Advanced).Move to the Closed Captioning option.Check the option “Enable live transcription service to show transcript on the side panel in-meeting.”Participants will then be able to choose to display auto-generated live captions during the Zoom meeting or event.
Captioning YouTube Videos
If using YouTube to publish your videos, you can add captions using YouTube's captioning interface. You can start with YouTube's auto-captions to create a draft transcript and then make updates to that transcript to correct for any errors. This YouTube video demonstrates steps for using YouTube's captioning interface to add accurate captions to a video.

Transcripts
A transcript is the same word-for-word content as captions but presented in a separate file. It provides a text alternative of the audio presentation and is not synchronized with the audio timeline. A transcript should contain relevant speaker information to distinguish who is saying what information.
Tips for transcripts
While transcripts may be provided for pre-recorded videos, they must be provided for audio-only content.Transcripts should include speaker information or any other informational cues appropriate to understanding the recording.If an audio or video was scripted before production the script can be used as the transcript.
Audio descriptions
Audio descriptions provide a verbal depiction of the key visual elements in a video presentation. For individuals who are blind, low-vision, or unable to view the video directly, audio descriptions communicate the important information relevant to understanding the video content. For example, a video may display a speaker’s name and title or specific instructions to follow. If this information is not included as part of the spoken dialogue, then it needs to be communicated as part of a separate audio description.
The Description Key from the Described and Captioned Media Program provides guidance for how to produce audio descriptions, including what to describe and how to describe on-screen information:
What to describeHow to describe visual content
Because audio descriptions exist as a separate track in the video presentation, it can be challenging to include these descriptions once the video is complete. A simpler way is to plan your script to describe any relevant on-screen information."
Web Tools,Hyperlinks,"Using descriptive text for hyperlinks helps website visitors scan for relevant information, identify outside resources, and choose which links are the most relevant for their needs.
In addition, some assistive technologies, such as screen readers for blind and visually-impaired individuals, have the ability to scan and present a list of all the hyperlinks available on a webpage. This allows a person to quickly jump to the relevant link instead of being forced to listen to the entire page line-by-line.
Tips for hyperlinks
Communicate the purpose or function of the hyperlink as part of the link name.Be as descriptive as possible without being overly long as some assistive technologies (e.g., screen-readers) will read the entire link text before moving to the next text content. Try keeping the hyperlink text under 120 characters.Integrate the link into your sentence, sighted users will see the link, and screen readers will hear the link.Ask yourself when writing a link text, ""Will the reader know where they are going just by the link text alone?""
Assistive Technology and Hyperlinks
Some assistive technologies can extract all the hyperlinks on a web page and present that information to the user. This allows an individual to quickly scan the hyperlinks and jump to the most relevant hyperlink on the page. 
 
The above example shows how a screen-reader could present the list of hyperlinks from the Stanford website. Providing descriptive link text can simplify interacting with electronic content and provide greater opportunity for the website visitor to find and engage with the information they are seeking.

Image Links
When using an image as a link, there are some specific rules that need to be followed. As discussed on the image ALT text concept pages, using an empty ALT text is fine for images that are purely decorative. However, as soon as you put an image inside of an anchor (link), then that image is no longer decorative, it is functional and the ALT text of the image needs to follow the function and not be descriptive of the actual image. For example: 
<a href=""https://stanford.edu"">
   <img src=""image.jpg"" alt=""Stanford University Homepage"">
</a>
There are some variations on this pattern though that should be addressed. If there is link text in addition to the image, then having an empty ALT text is preferred.
<a href=""https://stanford.edu"">
   <img src=""image.jpg"" alt="""">Stanford University
</a>
If the image link is redundant to another link that is adjacent to the image link, then removing that first link entirely from assistive technology is preferred. This involves two steps. First, remove the image link from the tab order using a negative tabindex value. Second, add an aria-hidden attribute to the image link (adding a role of presentation to the link would also work). In this case though, we need to add the ALT text back in for cases where a user might be using both a screen reader and a mouse (low vision users). 
<a href=""https://stanford.edu"" tabindex=""-1"" aria-hidden=""true"">
   <img src=""image.jpg"" alt=""Stanford University"">
</a>
[... snip ...]
<a href=""https://stanford.edu"">
   Stanford University

Web Tools,Office of Digital Accessibility Guide for Color,"Color, like images, can add visual appeal and draw attention to important information on webpages and in documents. However, in order for colors need to be distinguishable in order to be accessible to a wide audience. From an accessibility perspective, poor color choices can affect individuals who are visually impaired or color blind as well as those trying to view content in sunlight or in glare conditions.
General rules for using color
Provide sufficient contrast between the foreground text information and background color.Avoid using pastel or “light” version of colors.Use color in combination with text-based information.
Contrast
When choosing colors to present text information the foreground to background contrast ratio should be a minimum of:
4.5:1 for regular text3:1 for 18 point font and larger, or 14 point font and bold
The contrast ratio is evaluated by comparing the foreground and background color choices. You can test contrast ratio using these tools:
WebAIM Contrast CheckerTPGi Color Contrast Analyser
Contrast Example
In the image below, the ""Welcome"" text is presented in a thin, yellow font superimposed over the aqua-colored background. This creates difficulty in viewing the text information due to the low contrast with the background colors.

By selecting a different font color and changing the background shading, the ""Welcome"" text is much easier to read due to greater contrast between the foreground text content and the background color.

Color
Color should not be used as the sole means of providing information. Individuals who are blind, visually impaired, or have certain types of color-blindness may not be able to discern what information is being communicated by color alone.
If color is used as the only means of providing information, then this requires that a person must discern between the color differences in order to understand the information. For example, the pie chart below lacks number labels that identify the size of each slice. This forces people to rely on interpreting the colors based on the legend.

For some individuals, particularly those who have difficulty perceiving certain colors, this can be about as useful as having the same pie chart displayed in all grayscale.

Combining color with additional information can improve comprehension for all individuals. In the following pie chart, labels are included that identify the data value and the category name on the chart in addition to displaying a legend. This results in a combination of both color and data to present information to the user."
Web Tools,Stanford Color Contrast Chart,"Choosing the appropriate foreground and background color combination is necessary to meet color accessibility requirements and support access for individuals with disabilities.
Interactive Color Chart Tool
The Stanford Identity Guide identifies multiple color options for communicating a recognizable Stanford message, Use the interactive color chat tool to choose a foreground and background color from Stanford’s color palette. You can also enter your own custom background color in HEX format (#000000) if the color is not in the menus. The tool will help you evaluate color combinations in order to meet the minimum threshold for accessibility.
Other Tools
If you’re designing content that requires colors outside of the existing Stanford color palette, there are other tools that allow you to evaluate the contrast of any two color combinations:

WebAIM: Contrast Checker
Color Contrast Accessibility Validator
TPGi: Color Contrast Checker (for Windows and macOS)"
Web Tools,Office of Digital Accessibility Guide for Images,"Images on web pages provide not only visual appeal, but many times also convey important information. Alternative text, called alt text for short, improves accessibility by providing a text equivalent of the information presented visually. Including alt text with your images ensures all individuals, regardless of visual ability, can engage with your content.
Alt text should be:

Accurate: including spelling, grammar, and proper punctuation.
Concise: using the fewest words possible while providing a meaningful description for the image.
Equivalent: presenting the same content and/or function of the image.

Assistive technologies will announce when an object is an image, so including this information is redundant and not necessary.
Tips for writing effective alt text

Describe the image as specifically as possible. 
Keep it short (around 125 characters or less).
Don't include ""image of,"" ""picture of,"" ""graphic of"" etc. 
Don't include the file extension, .jpg or .png, .gif, etc. 
If the image medium is important (such as a photograph or oil painting), then include the medium in your alt text.
Image buttons should have an alt attribute that describes the function of the button like, ""search,"" ""donate,"" “sign up,” etc.

Photos
The alt text will depend on the context and intention of the image. For the image below, the alt text could be ""XPP Instrument Area Manager Daniel Stefanescu prepares LCLS instruments for beam and experiments in the Chemistry Lab on the historic Stanford University campus. ""

Buttons
There are times when images also serve a function, like a button for example. In these cases, the alt text should communicate the function and include the appropriate text from the image. For the button below, the alt text could be ""Learn more about our research.""

Illustrations, graphs, and charts
Illustrations, graphs, and charts should include alt text that describes the important, relevant information. Instead of repeating every single data point in a chart or graph, it may be more effective to summarize the overall meaning or intent of the graphic representation. Following the image, the key elements may be presented as text on the page for an individual to read and review.
For the graph below, the alt text could be ""Graph depicting Stanford's path to reduced emissions from 2011 to 2021""
The text on the page could then identify the key elements as presented in the image, such as:
""Stanford's path to reduced emissions is demonstrated by the peak GHG emissions in 2011, to 2015 at 50% below peak with SESI going online, followed by 2016 and the first solar plant become available. In 2017 emissions were 68% below peak and attributed to on-campus rooftop solar. Projections indicate 2021 to be 80% below peak with a second solar plant becoming available.""

Punctuation
When considering punctuation for your image ALT text, the question comes up if you should end the alt text in a period, so that screen reader users know the description is finished as indicated by the pause added by the screen reader. The answer to that question is it depends.
When considering ALT text, adding punctuation depends on the context of the image and how it is used on the page, in addition to normal factors such as what the image looks like. While there are no hard and fast rules one way or the other, the following cases might give you some insight as to what you should do with ALT text punctuation. Also, consider that when a screen reader reads the content of an image, it will read the ALT text first, and then follow that with the word “image”. So, it is not important to add punctuation just for the sake of making the screen reader pause as the screen reader will already do that as part of the process of identifying the type of element it just read.
In the case however where the punctuation would be something other than a period, such as a question mark or exclamation mark, then that element should always be included. 
Case 1: Image links
When an image is being used as a link, then the alt text should function as the text for the link. In this case, it will be rare that adding punctuation to the end of the ALT text makes sense. 
<a href=""https://uit.stanford.edu/"">
   <img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""Add to Cart"">
</a>
Case 2: Short ALT text
When writing ALT text, one of the key principles is to write the text that is as concise as possible. When an ALT text is very short, such as when the ALT is just a few words, then adding punctuation does not make sense. For example, when including a headshot of a person, often the ALT text will just be the person's name, and adding punctuation at the end of this text isn't appropriate.
<img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""Leland Stanford"">
Case 3: 'Regular' ALT text
In this case, we are assuming that the ALT is approximately one sentence in length. This is the most ambiguous of the different cases in that it is entirely appropriate for the period to be present or not. Both of the following examples would be considered appropriate punctuation.
<img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""The Golden Gate Bridge at sunset with a large container ship traveling underneath"">
<img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""The Golden Gate Bridge at sunset with a large container ship traveling underneath."">
Case 4: Multiple sentences
The final case is when we have an ALT text that has multiple sentences in it. In this case, since there is already a period in the ALT text for one sentence, there should be the same for the second.
<img src=""https://uit.stanford.edu/image.png"" alt=""The Golden Gate Bridge at sunset. Photo courtesy John Smith, AP News."">
Decorative Images
Images that do not convey any meaning or are redundant to other information on the page should be considered decorative images and be given null ALT text of alt=””. It is important to remember that you must include this NULL alt text because without this empty alt attribute, screen reading programs will attempt to ‘guess’ as to what the information is by reading other elements, such as the file name of the image.
While there are no definitive standards that cover every possible scenario of what constitutes a decorative image, consider the following when making a decision:
Design elements
Elements such as borders and lines or other imagery that is exclusively for the design of the page are the most obvious elements that should be considered decorative. This includes any non-meaningful borders, lines, corners, shadows, or spacer images.
‘Stock’ Photos
Images may be included on web pages to convey a feeling about the page or provide some other visual interest, but do not provide any actual detail. Such images may come from a stock photo service or from other sources (it doesn't have to be from a stock service to be considered a stock photo). Per guidance from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, a stock photo or image used for ambiance (“eye-candy”) that is used only to add visual interest to the page can be marked as a decorative image.
For example, if you could swap out a photo with another image that completely replaces the people and places within it, but the ALT text wouldn’t change, then it’s probably a non-meaningful photo. When we look at the following image, the photo that accompanies these links to research areas could be any student in any lab on any campus and the alt text would be very similar if not the same.

An image showing a student in a lab on the Stanford Research page. While it could be argued that this is a meaningful image in some way, more than likely this should be considered a decorative ""stock"" photo as it only provides ‘eye candy’ to the more meaningful links and headings that accompany the image on the right.
Redundant Images
Images may also be used in conjunction with other text on the page without providing any additional content or information. For example, when looking at a list of events from the Stanford Events calendar (below), there is both the title of the story and the picture from the story. In this context, the image doesn’t provide any additional relevant information to a user that is trying to decide if they want to read additional details about the event or not. The events calendar is correctly done therefore by having a NULL alt text for each image. 

These events all have a thumbnail picture that accompanies the image title and details. While some of these images will be informative on the details page, in this context they should all be considered decorative and NULL alt text used. Note, if these images are also links, then other techniques need to be used to remove the image entirely from screen reader and keyboard-only users."
Web Tools,Office of Digital Accessibility Guide for Headings & Structure,"Take a quick look at a newspaper, magazine article, or even a novel. At a quick glance, you can easily ascertain the title, the titles of articles, the ""lead"" story, and major sections of content. The visual design and layout for all of these media types presents an organized and structured format that allows people to find information quickly and easily. This same approach can be applied to electronic content to support accessibility functionality.
Headings
Organizing content prevents cognitive overload, providing information in digestible pieces for your students. Headings are valuable in presenting the main points of a section, by providing a logical structure for information, or allowing visitors to skim the contents.
From an accessibility perspective, headings provide individuals using screen readers with a simple method to navigate within a page or a document. A recent WebAIM survey of screen-reader users found that using headings remains the predominant method for finding web page information and that over 80% of respondents found headings very useful or somewhat useful when navigating content. The use of headings allows individuals to move and find information in a more efficient manner.
Using different heading styles and font sizes helps organize information into meaningful sections and demonstrates how subtopics relate to the main topics, and with one another. For example, a document structure could be:

Heading 1 is the main topic or title of the content
Heading 2 is used for major subtopics that relate to the main content
Heading 3, Heading 4, and Heading 5 could be used to further refine related subtopics


For example, on the Stanford website, headings are used to indicate major sections and topics. The screenshot reveals the heading structure of the web page identifying heading 2 and heading 3 elements throughout the page. Not shown is the primary heading 1 of this page called Research.
General rules for headings

The main title should always be formatted as Heading 1. Subsequent headers should be applied in descending order. Don’t skip heading levels. For Example: Don’t use Heading 3 for the main title, followed by a Heading 1, and then a Heading 4.
Specify a heading element and then modify its appearance. Don’t use font size, bold, or underline features to create the appearance of a heading.

Lists
Lists neatly present related ideas and outline steps in a process. Bulleted and numbered lists can be used in documents to format, arrange, and emphasize text. For an individual using assistive technology, such as a screen-reader, the list format will communicate the presence and number of items in the list when navigating the content. This can help a person understand the overall scope of the list information and the number of items involved.
Bulleted List
If items are a group of equivalent ideas or terms, and the order is not an essential aspect of the concept, use a bulleted list. For example, the following is a list of basic accessibility practices for electronic documents:

Organize material into usable sections
Use styles to mark headings
Use meaningful words to identify hyperlinks
Provide text descriptions (i.e., alt text) for images

All of these accessibility practices are relevant to creating an accessible document. As such, a bulleted list can be used as it does not require a specific order or a sequence to follow.
Numbered List
If items are a sequence or a series of steps, use a numbered list. A numbered list is important when there are specific steps to perform as part of a process. For example, the following is a list of steps to take to login to email:

Open your web browser
Navigate to the email login page
Enter your user name and password
Press the Submit button

In this example, following a specific sequence of steps is necessary to complete the task successfully. When a specific order of operation is necessary to completing a task, then a numbered list is more effective in communicating those steps."
Web Tools,Accessible Canvas Pages,"Canvas is the learning management system (LMS) available for Stanford classes, providing instructors with a platform to communicate with students, post course materials, and create online assignments. Creating accessible Canvas pages can be accomplished by incorporating the following practices into your authoring process.
Headings & structureImagesHyperlinksTablesColorExtended time for Canvas quizzes
Headings & structure
Headings can provide an organizational and navigational framework for a document's content, communicating both the informational hierarchy and relationship between different sections. Headings also provide a simple mechanism for an individual using assistive technologies to ""jump"" from one heading to the next when navigating the document.
Highlight the brief word or phrase, or place your cursor on the line.In the Rich Content Editor select the styles dropdown menu to reveal Headings 2-4.

Heading guidelines
Headings should follow a logical structure that identifies content based on the organizational content and hierarchy of information in the document.Canvas automatically tags the page title as Heading 1. Page content headings should start at Heading 2.Avoid skipping heading levels.Headings should be short and succinct.
For additional guidance on formatting, please review the information on Structure.
Lists
Lists provide a structured order to a group of connected or sequential content. A numbered or bulleted list may present the same information more effectively than simple data tables with fewer steps.
Highlight the grouped text.In the rich content editor, select the appropriate list style (bullet or number list).

Formatting guidelines
Remove any lists created manually, such as those using dashes, asterisk, or other symbol characters.Avoid using indentation to provide a visual list in lieu of the list style button.Numbered lists are used to present a group of items (words, phrases, sentences) that follow a sequence.Bulleted lists are used for a group of items without a sequence.Lists should contain at least two or more list items, unless being used to create an outline.Nested lists are acceptable, such as a numbered list that contains a nested bulleted list.
Images
Images that support the content require a text description (also called ""alt text"") that communicates the purpose and/or content of the image. This information is presented to the individual using assistive technologies, allowing them to hear the description of the image. Image descriptions should be short and communicate the main purpose of the image. Images that are decorative can be marked as such and are ignored by assistive technologies.
If a longer description of the image is necessary to fully explain its content, consider inserting a more detailed description of the image within the document text that precedes and/or follows the image.
Adding Alt Text
Select the image. The image should be outlined blue and have four blue squares at each edge.When the image is selected, an Image Options will appear either above or below the image.If the image has pedagogical value, write a brief description in the Alt Text box.Select Done to save the information.

Image guidelines
A text description should convey the purpose or content of the image in approximately 120 characters or less. Avoid repeating the same information as contained in the surrounding text.If the image is decorative, select the Decorative Image checkboxIf the image is complex, use a short alt text description for the image and then provide additional information in the surrounding text of the document.Do not include the file format in the alt text (Example: .JPEG, .PNG).Do not include phrases “A picture of” or “An image of” as part of the alt text.
For additional guidance on writing effective text descriptions (i.e., alt text), please review the information on Images.
Hyperlinks
Documents containing hyperlinks to websites or other online resources can be improved by using descriptive link text that is understood by the reader instead of the full URL. Using the full URL as the link text may not make sense to the reader, particularly if it is long.
Link to an external resource
Highlight the text to be converted into a hyperlink.In the rich content editor,  select Links > External Links.In the Insert Link window, add the URL to the Link field. Select Done.
Edit an existing link
Place cursor on link. A submenu will appear. Select Link Options.In the Text field, write descriptive text. Select Done.
Hyperlink guidelines

Tables
Tables in Canvas should be used for data and not layout purposes. An accessible table includes the following:
At least one header (row and/or column).Alt Text description summarizing the table.
The easiest method to ensure an accessible data table in Canvas is to use the Accessibility Checker. After you create the table in the Canvas Rich Content Editor, use the Accessibility Checker to add the appropriate table header information.
Create your Canvas page and then create a table.At the bottom of the editor, select the Accessibility Checker.In the drop-down menu Set a table header, select the appropriate header(s). Select Apply to save your work!Finally, under the Add a Caption field, write a brief and descriptive summary of the table. Select Apply to save your work!
Color
Color can be an effective method to communicate ideas and draw attention to information. Ensuring there is sufficient contrast as well as using color in combination with text formatting can support a diverse campus community, including individuals with visual disabilities. For additional guidance on using color and accessibility, please review the information on Color.
Contrast
When choosing colors to present text information in documents, avoid pastel colors or the “light” version of a particular color. Such color options do not provide sufficient contrast against a white background. Contrast ratios should be the following:
4.5:1 for regular text3:1 for 18 point font and larger, or 14 point font and bold
Contrast ratios may be evaluated using tools such as:
WebAIM Contrast CheckerThe Paciello Group Color Contrast Analyser
Color and formatting
When using color to indicate a specific condition or state, include text formatting to provide a distinguishing characteristic. For example, if a list of vocabulary words were identified only in red text, this could present difficulties for an individual who has a type of color-blindness.
Use color and formatting to support accessibility, such as:
Red text with Bold formattingUsing an asterisk, brackets, or other annotation symbols in addition to color
Extended time for Canvas quizzes
Some students may require additional time on a Canvas Quiz. Instructors can modify Canvas Quiz settings to allow for multiple attempts or to support students approved for an extended time. Please see the Canvas Instructor Guide: How to grant extra time or attempts in a quiz."
Web Tools,Accessible Google Slides Presentations,"Google Slides is a popular tool for creating slide show presentations. Improving the accessibility of Google Slides can be accomplished by incorporating the following practices into your authoring process.
StructureImagesHyperlinksExporting to MS PowerPoint
Structure
The structure of the content can provide an organizational and navigational framework for individuals to understand the informational hierarchy and relationship between different sections of content. These structural elements can help determine the organization and logical reading order of the presentation for an individual using assistive technologies. Google Slides provides three features, which assist with content structure: Slide Themes, Slide Layouts, and Slide Title.
More information about the advantages of using structure can be found on the Headings & Structure concepts page.
Slide title
The Slide Title is used to provide a heading for the slide's content. Slide titles should be unique and descriptive to help users navigate to specific content on the slides.

Slide layout
The Slide Layout provides templates with content regions in a predefined layout. Using a predefined slide layout will help ensure that the slide has the correct heading structure, numbered and bulleted list styles, and reading order.
In the toolbar, select Layout. Choose your desired layout.

Managing reading order
If creating separate text boxes that are not part of a preset layout, any of this content may not be in the correct reading order. When placing content manually onto a blank slide, you will need to assess and manage the reading order using the Arrange button in the toolbar.
Tab through the slide to see the reading order. The order in which elements are selected indicate the order in which they will be read.To change the reading order, select Arrange > Order.Send Backward will move the element to be read earlier in the reading order.Bring Forward will move the element to be read later in the reading order.Test the reading order with the Tab key again.

Although most Slide Layouts and Slide Themes contain slide titles - you may see a blank slide. To provide logical reading order, please note that every slide should have a Slide Title.
Images
Images that support the content require a text description (also called ""alternate text"") to communicate the purpose and/or content of the image. Image descriptions should be short and communicate the main purpose of the image. If a longer description of the image is necessary to fully explain its content, consider alternate strategies outlined on the Images page.
To add the alternate text:
Select the image. Right-click.Select Alt text.In the Alt Text window, write the alt text in the Description field.Select OK.

For additional guidance on writing effective text descriptions (i.e., alt text), please review the Images concept page.
Hyperlinks
Documents containing hyperlinks to websites or other online resources can be improved by including hyperlink text that is understood by the reader. For instance, using the full hyperlink URL may not make sense to the reader without some context.
Highlight the descriptive word or phrase that will become the hyperlink.Select Insert Link button in the rich content editor.Write the hyperlink in the Link field and select Apply.
Exporting to PowerPoint
If you plan to distribute your presentation to others as an MS PowerPoint, download the Google Slides as a PowerPoint Presentation and then run the Accessibility Checker from within PowerPoint. This can help identify any potential accessibility issues and prompt you for corrections.
Select File.Select Download.Select Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx).Download the file and run the Microsoft PowerPoint Accessibility Checker
The Accessibility Checker will identify potential accessibility issues in the downloaded PowerPoint file. The most common issue is the need to verify the reading order on each slide."
Web Tools,Accessible PowerPoint Presentations,"This documentation was created using Microsoft PowerPoint 365 for macOS.
Microsoft PowerPoint includes options for adding accessibility information to slides to support access by individuals with disabilities. This information also ensures that Microsoft PowerPoint files maintain a level of accessibility when converted into other formats (e.g., tagged PDF). Creating accessible PowerPoint presentations can be accomplished by incorporating the following practices into your authoring process.
StructureImagesHyperlinksColorTablesExporting to other formatsCreating a PDF of your presentation
Structure
The structure of the content can provide an organizational and navigational framework for individuals to understand the informational hierarchy and relationship between different sections of content. These structural elements can help determine the organization and logical reading order of the presentation for an individual using assistive technologies.
Slide Title
The Slide Title is used to provide a heading for the slide's content. Slide titles should be unique and descriptive to help users navigate to specific content on the slides. To view and edit slide titles quickly:
Select View.Select Outline View.Edit the titles accordingly.

If slide titles are the same, provide a numerical reference to differentiate the first slide from subsequent slides. For example, if there are two consecutive slides that cover the same topic, ""How do you use a webpage?"", consider adding a number or unique identifier to the end of the title. For example,  two titles with the same name could be identified as: “How do you use a webpage? Part 1” and “How do you use a webpage? Part 2”.
Slide Layout
Using preset slide layouts will automatically control the reading order and structure of content placed on the slide. To choose a slide layout:
To locate Slide Layout, select Home > select New Slide.Choose the slide layout that meets your needs.

For more information, read Microsoft’s support page, Apply a slide layout.
Managing Reading Order
If text boxes are separately created from the preset slide layouts, this information may not be in the correct reading order. If content is manually placed onto a blank slide, you will need to assess and manage the reading order using the Arrange button. To review and fix reading order:
Select Home > Arrange > Selection PaneThe reading order begins at the bottom of the list of regions. The first item to be read is at the bottom and the last item to be read is at the top.To modify the reading order in the Selection Pane, drag the appropriate item to the proper location in the sequence.

 
List
Use the built-in list styles to provide users additional guidance. Do the grouped items convey a process or have a logical sequence? If so, then use the number list style. Is this grouped list of items in no particular order? If so, then use the bullet list style.
Select Home.Select either the bullet or number list style.
Images
Images that support the content require a text description (also called ""alternate text"") to communicate the purpose and/or content of the image. Image descriptions should be short and communicate the main purpose of the image. If a longer description of the image is necessary to fully explain its content, consider alternate strategies outlined on the Images concept page.
To add the alternate text:
Right-click the image.Select Edit Alt Text…In the Alt Text window, write a descriptive text.

Image description guidelines
For additional guidance on writing effective text descriptions (i.e., alt text), please review theImages concepts page.
A text description should convey the purpose or content of the image in approximately 120 characters or less.Avoid repeating the same information as contained in the surrounding text.For images that are decorative not relevant to the content, use the check box Mark as decorative.If the image is complex, consider providing additional information in the surrounding text of the document while providing a shortened text description.Do not include the file format in the alt text (Example: .JPEG, .PNG).Do not include “picture of” or “image of” in the alt text.For older versions of PowerPoint, leave the Title field blank, and only use the Description field for alt text.
Hyperlinks
Documents containing hyperlinks to websites or other online resources can be improved by including hyperlink text that is understood by the reader. For instance, using the full hyperlink URL may not make sense to the reader without some context.
Highlight the short descriptive phase or words that will become the descriptive hyperlink.Select the Link button in the menu.In the Address field, add the desired URL.Select OK.

For additional guidance, please refer to the Hyperlinks concept page.
If the PowerPoint presentation is intended to also serve as a handout with resource hyperlinks, content authors may want to create a reference slide at the end that lists the full URL of the hyperlink.
Tables
When possible, use a simple table structure for tabular data. Using tables with split cells, merged cells, or nested tables can lead to issues with assistive technologies recognizing the appropriate column and row header information in a data table.
Avoid using a table to manage layout. Instead, use a Slide Layout that orients content into the appropriate visual layout you desire.
Tables should include the following:
At least one header (the row and/or column).Alt Text description summarizing the table.
Specify the header
To mark a header row for a data table:
Select the table to reveal Table Design. (Note: this tab will only appear if the table is selected.)In the far left-hand section, determine the required header type:
Header row: check the box Header Row.Column header: check the box First Column.


Color
Color can be an effective way to communicate ideas and draw attention to information. Insufficient color and contrast can limit the ability of others to perceive and understand the presentation.
PowerPoint offers a variety of slide themes, but not all of these will provide sufficient contrast. To edit Slide Theme colors:
Select Design > Expand the Color Palette Menu to reveal available color combinations.Select Colors to review the pre-built color palettes or select Customize Colors to create slides that have appropriate color contrast.
Select one with accessible contrast, or select Customize Colors to manually select the colors. Alternatively, you can use other methods in Microsoft PowerPoint to remove or change the current theme in your presentation.
For additional guidance, please refer to the Colors concept page.
Exporting to other formats
Do not use the ""Print"" to PDF option. This will create a PDF document that lacks PDF tags with no heading information, no alternative text, and no logical document structure. These types of PDF documents will create barriers when accessing the document with assistive technologies.
Creating a PDF
Using “Save As” on a Mac
Users of PowerPoint for Mac should be cautioned that exporting to PDF will not yield an accessible, tagged PDF document, it must be remediated using Acrobat Pro.
Using “Save As” on a Windows PC
Select File > Save As.Select PDF > More options.In the Save As dialog, select Options.Verify in the Options dialog that Document structure tags for accessibility is selected. Select OK.
Creating a PDF with Acrobat
Use the Acrobat plug-in in the ribbon. Select the Acrobat tab.Select Create PDF."
Web Tools,Accessible Google Documents,"Google Docs includes options for adding accessibility information to documents to support access by individuals with disabilities. Improving the accessibility of Google Docs can be accomplished by incorporating the following practices into your authoring process.
Headings & structureImagesHyperlinksColorExporting to other formats
Headings & structure
Headings can provide an organizational and navigational framework for a document's content, communicating both the informational hierarchy and relationship between different sections. Headings also provide a simple mechanism for an individual using assistive technologies to ""jump"" from one heading to the next when navigating the document.
In the toolbar select the drop-down menu Styles button to reveal all headings.To make an item a heading in Google Docs, select the Styles drop-down menu, located to the left of the font drop-down menu.
Headings can be marked with the following keyboard commands:
Heading FunctionmacOS CommandWindows CommandApply Heading 1Command + Option + 1Ctrl + Alt + 1Apply Heading 2Command + Option + 2Ctrl + Alt + 2Apply Heading 3Command + Option + 3Ctrl + Alt + 3
Important considerations
Headings should follow a logical structure that identifies content based on the organizational content and hierarchy of information in the document.Avoid skipping heading levels - modify the style of the heading if you prefer a specific font or appearance.
Lists
Lists provide a structured order to a group of connected or sequential content. A numbered or bulleted list may present the same information more effectively than simple data tables with fewer steps.
Highlight the grouped list of items.In the toolbar, select the appropriate list style (i.e, numbered list or bulleted list).
Images
Images that support the content require a text description (also called ""alt text"") that communicates the purpose and/or content of the image. This information is presented to the individual using assistive technologies, allowing them to hear the description of the image. Image descriptions should be short and communicate the main purpose of the image. Images that are considered decorative can be marked as such and are ignored by assistive technologies.
If a longer description of the image is necessary to fully explain its content, consider inserting a more detailed description of the image within the document text that precedes and/or follows the image.
Adding Alt Text
Select and right-click the image.Select Alt Text.In the Description field, provide a brief and concise description and select OK.
For additional guidance on writing effective text descriptions (i.e., alt text), please review the information on Images.
Image guidelines
Alt text should be included in the ""Description"" field and not the ""Title"" field.A text description should convey the purpose or content of the image in approximately 120 characters or less. Avoid repeating the same information as contained in the surrounding text.If the image is complex, consider providing additional information in the surrounding text of the document while providing a shortened text description.Do not include the file format in the alt text (Example: .JPEG, .PNG).Do not include “picture of” or ""image of"" in the alt text.
Hyperlinks
Documents containing hyperlinks to websites or other online resources can be improved by including hyperlink text that is understood by the reader. Using the full URL as the hyperlink text may not make sense to the reader, particularly if it is long.
Place the cursor anywhere on the desired hyperlink. Right-click the hyperlink.Select Link.Under Text to Display, write the descriptive text for the hyperlink. Keep the text name short and descriptive.Select Apply.
Color
Color can be an effective method to communicate ideas and draw attention to information. Ensuring there is sufficient contrast as well as using color in combination with other formatting can support a diverse campus community, including individuals with visual disabilities. For more information on using color or these tools, please review the information on Color.
Contrast
When choosing colors to present text information in documents, choose color options that provide a contrast ratio of:
4.5:1 for regular text3:1 for 18 point font and larger, or 14 point font and bold
In general, pastel colors or the “light” version of a particular color do not provide sufficient contrast against a white background.
Contrast ratios may be evaluated using tools such as:
WebAIM Contrast Checker The Paciello Group Color Contrast Analyser
Color and formatting
When using color to indicate a specific condition or state, include some formatting attribute to also provide a distinguishing characteristic. For example, if a list of vocabulary words were identified only in red text, this could present difficulties for an individual who had some type of color-blindness.
Options to support accessibility can include a combination of color AND formatting, such as:
Red text with Bold formattingUsing an asterisk, brackets, or other annotation symbols in addition to color
Exporting to other formats
Google Docs to PDF
At this time Google Docs are not able to produce accessible PDF versions. If you export your Google Docs file as a PDF document, the accessibility information will not be included in the resulting PDF version. Instead, download your Google Doc as a Microsoft Word file to run the Accessibility Checker and convert to an accessible PDF.
In the toolbar menu, select File > Download > Microsoft Word (.docx).In Microsoft Word, run the Accessibility Checker, and address any accessibility issues before exporting to a PDF."

Web Tools,Setting up Social Sharing with Page Properties in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM),"Setting up Social Sharing with Page Properties in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
What Is Social Sharing?
You’ve probably seen attractively formatted links to articles and web pages on Twitter and Facebook that include a small box with features like a title, photo, and article summary/teaser. Here’s an example:

Large publishers and sites apply specific formatting to their pages to achieve this effect on Twitter and Facebook.
You can do this for your AEM pages, too, by using the Page Properties dialog.
Why Specify Social Sharing Data Myself?
Facebook, Twitter, and other sites will attempt to format content appropriately for social sharing. However, there are two reasons to provide this information yourself.
First of all, you will have more control over what content is displayed and how. For example, if you do not select an image, Facebook/Twitter will attempt to choose a content image from the page. This image may not look as good or represent the page content as well as you would like.
Secondly, it is easier to set up social sharing before a page is live than to make changes later. Some sites have tools to force an update to social sharing information, but not all do.
Add/Edit Headings and Descriptions
The name of your site appears by default. You can add/edit a page title and description on the “Basic” tab of the Page Properties. (See below)
Step 1: Select the “Page” tab in the toolkit
 
Step 2: Open “Page Properties”

Step 3: Use Page Properties to edit the text you want


Add/Edit an Image
Click the image tab in Page Properties to add or edit an image. Be aware that if you do not choose an image, Facebook/Twitter may attempt to select one from the page for you. How well that works will vary, depending on page content.

To add an image, drag it over from the DAM. DO NOT upload it from your desktop, it won’t save to AEM.
You can also crop or rotate the image if necessary.
Click “clear” to remove an image."
HR Systems,Tips for Using Axess,"1. Use a recommended browser
There are hundreds of potential operating system/browser combinations in the world, but only a handful are guaranteed to work properly with Axess. You are welcome to try logging in to Axess with any browser on any platform, but be aware that only the following browsers are certified to work successfully with Axess and the underlying PeopleSoft system:



CERTIFIED BROWSERS




Firefox 24 or higher


Internet Explorer 11 or higher


Chrome 35 or higher



Safari 6 or higherNote: If scroll bars fail to appear  in Safari, go to your Mac's System Preferences > General and select Show scroll bars - Always.




 





Users are strongly encouraged to use these recommended browsers, as other browsers may not be fully compatible with Axess/PeopleSoft. In addition:

Pop-up blockers must be turned off
Cookies must be enabled
Javascript must be enabled





 

""Why isn't my browser certified to work with Axess?""
The software behind the Axess system comes to us from external software vendors who build and test their products based on the current browsers in the marketplace. However, operating systems and browsers are constantly being updated, and it is almost impossible for large-scale, browser-based applications to adjust to each and every one of those changes. In some cases, OS/browser combinations other than those listed above may work, but we cannot guarantee that they will.
If you find your favorite browser does not work properly with Axess, please try using one of the recommended browser options listed above.
2. Clear your cache
Each time you access a web page via your browser, the browser stores the page in a temporary local ""cache"" for quick easy reference later. This can be useful for speeding up access to frequently-used pages, but it can also allow out-of-date pages to pop up and cause problems. Problems with access to web-based applications like Axess can frequently be resolved by clearing your cache.

PeopleSoft Training Center (for administrative staff)"
HR Systems,PeopleSoft Training Center,"Overview
This page provides information for users of the PeopleSoft Student Administration and HR modules. Those who use the PeopleSoft Learning Management System (known as ""STARS"" at Stanford) should see the Stanford Training and Registration System (STARS) page.
What training do I need to take?
Training is required in order to gain access to the PeopleSoft system. User training is provided primarily through online training modules. All new users must first complete the PeopleSoft Concepts & Compliance training module. Additional training requirements vary depending upon what function(s) you will perform in PeopleSoft:

HR Users: See the HR Management System website for requirements.
STARS Learning/Enrollment Administrators: See the STARS Course Administration & Reporting page for requirements.
Student Administration & Postdoc Web Forms Users: See PeopleSoft Training Requirements for details.

How do I get access to PeopleSoft?
There are multiple steps in the authority-granting process.
Prospective users of PeopleSoft HR should refer to the HR Management System page for information about obtaining access to the system.
For prospective Student Administration users, the process is as follows:

Complete the required training identified on the PeopleSoft Training Requirements page.
Your manager must submit a request to the Authority Grantor for your School or Business Area specifying the authority to be granted to you. The request must provide your name, SUNet ID, department, and job title/responsibilities.
The Authority Grantor enters role-specific transactions into Authority Manager to indicate the authority to be granted.
An automated process matches the Grantor's entries with training completion certification(s) entered in the system by the Training Administrator, and subsequently establishes the appropriate PeopleSoft security."
HR Systems,Online Learning Player Support,"What is the Online Learning Player?
The Online Learning Player provides animated and interactive demos showing how to perform various business tasks in Stanford's PeopleSoft system. You can view the demos passively in ""See It"" mode, or go through steps interactively in ""Try It"" mode.
Using the Online Learning Player
Upon launching the Online Learning Player, you will see a Table of Contents outline on the left side of the window. You can drill down through the table of contents by clicking the ""+"" buttons to get to the topic you'd like to view.
Playing a topic
Click on any title at any level of the table of contents outline; for most titles you will see related ""Concept"" information appear on the right side of the window. While not all titles have Concept information, it's a good idea to check for it before continuing to drill down to the individual topic level.
At the fully expanded level of the Table of Contents outline you will see Topic documents, denoted by a ""document"" icon rather than a ""book"" icon. Click on a Topic and the ""See It"" and ""Try It"" Playback Mode options display in the upper-left of the window.
With your topic selected, click either the See It or Try It button to launch the Player.

See It plays the lesson as a self-running demo.
Try It is more interactive, requiring you to click on the indicated links and enter values in fields.

Note that Try It also allows you to control the pace of the lesson, whereas See It plays at a set speed.
Tips for using the Player
Click the Pause button that appears in any of the instruction text bubbles in See It mode to pause playback.
Things moving a little too slowly for you in See It mode? Press your Enter key to advance forward to the next step/frame.
Click the Actions button in any of the instruction text bubbles within Try It mode to access additional playback controls:
Pressing the ESC key on your keyboard at any time in any mode will end playback and return you to the Table of Contents outline.
You may notice that the PeopleSoft Menu you see in the demos is much longer than what you see when logged on to PeopleSoft yourself; this is because each user sees only those menu options that are available to him or her based on user security. So don't worry if your list isn't as long as the ones you see in the demos!
Browser requirements for the Player

Windows users can run the Online Learning Player in Internet Explorer or FireFox.
Mac users must be using FireFox to run the Player.

Pop-up blockers must be turned off in order for the Player to run successfully. Windows users who have turned off pop-up blockers but still have trouble getting the Player to launch often have success by holding down the CTRL key as they click the See It or Try It buttons."

HR Systems,NIH Other Support Certification & Electronic Signatures – Adobe Sign vs Adobe Pro DC/Acrobat Reader KB,"Investigators are responsible for the complete disclosure of funding and resources and for the certification as required by NIH. Investigators must not ask their research administrators to certify on their behalf. Investigators should work with their administrative and financial teams to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their specific Other Support document—which the investigator certifies with their digital signature.
RMG has supplied documentation on this process:
https://med.stanford.edu/rmg/resources/federal-agency-disclosure/nih-other-support.html
PREFERRED METHOD: ADOBE SIGN
Investigators are expected to electronically sign with Adobe Sign. They can request the Adobe Sign account here: https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/35577f5cae634045977b75207d572ba9
If they already have an Adobe Sign account through the Stanford license, they may use that account so long as they are not in a PHI-settings enabled group. You can determine if they are in a PHI-setting group if the system forces them to Password Protect the document to be signed. If this is the case, use the Alternative Method via Adobe Pro/Adobe Acrobat Reader.
Instructions for how to use Adobe Sign for NIH Other Support Certification including what needs to be kept for internal records to comply with NIH’s requirements are located here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bgif-3w4ev8KqJPYkB_Oju1YftCk4sk1/view
POTENTIAL ISSUE: Users with an existing Adobe Pro account will receive error messages when trying to sign up/install Adobe sign. Adobe Sign needs to manually consolidate the two accounts. You will need to assist them with getting this resolved through Adobe Sign Support: Contacting Adobe Sign Support: KB00018623
ALTERNATE METHOD for ADOBE PRO DC/ADOBE ACROBAT READER:
Only if the user is in a PHI-settings enabled group for Adobe Sign should they use the alternative method via Adobe Pro/Adobe Acrobat Reader (otherwise, they need to setup Adobe Sign). You can determine if they are in a PHI-setting group if the system forces them to Password Protect the document to be signed.

HR Systems,Digital Signature - Adobe Sign,"Digital signature software offers an alternative to paper-based forms. Instead of completing and signing forms by hand, digital signature software allows users to complete and sign forms electronically.
When you need to collect information from an individual or a group of people, you can use digital signature software to create a custom form. You then use the software to send the form out to be completed and signed. The software routes the document to the recipients either in parallel or serial order, depending upon your designation. The software has a built-in tracking feature that sends notifications to you when a document is signed, and reminders when a document has not been signed.
This software helps prevent common mistakes, such as missing a required signature or using an outdated form.
Importantly, digital signatures are legally binding in most industrialized nations, having the same legal status as a handwritten signature.
NOTE: If you are trying to use Adobe Sign for your National Institutes of Health (NIH) Other Support Certification Electronic Signatures, refer to NIH Other Support Certification & Electronic Signatures – Adobe Sign vs Adobe Pro DC/Acrobat Reader.

Software Applications,CrowdStrike FAQs,"Below is a list of common questions and answers for the University’s new Endpoint Protection Software: https://uit.stanford.edu/service/edr
CrowdStrike for Endpoints
Q. What are my options for Anti-Malware as a Student or Staff for personally owned system?A. A free/low-cost option is Sophos Home, but we recommend researching online and assessing what best fits your needs.Q. Why is BigFix/Jamf recommended to be used with CrowdStrike?A. BigFix/Jamf aids in the maintenance and approval to run CrowdStrike optimally. CrowdStrike is a managed antivirus solution and is not recommended for VLRE users.Q. Will I see anything different?A. The biggest difference visually is the absence of icons in the Windows System Tray, status menu or menu bars.Q. If there are no icons, how do I know it’s running on my computer?
A. You now have the ability to verify if Crowdstrike is running through MyDevices. BigFix must be present on the system to report CrowdStrike status.​​Windows:
On Windows, open a Command Prompt window (Start > Windows System > Command Prompt)
On Windows, open a Command Prompt window (Start > Windows System > Command Prompt)
Run the following command to ensure that “STATE” is “RUNNING”
sc query csagent

On Macs, open Terminal window (Finder > Terminal)
Run the following command
(6.x Client) sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl statsYou will see a long output and basically looking for this:​


=== Communications ===Cloud Info
    Host: ts01-b.cloudsink.net
    Port: 443
    State: connected
 
You can check if you are on the 6.x client check by going to go your applications folder and clicking the Falcon icon.

For MacOS Mojave 10.14 through Catalina 10.15 to check if the kernel extension is approved and loaded by running the following terminal cmd:  ""kextstat | grep crowd"".If ""com.crowdstrike.sensor"" is displayed, it indicates that kernel extensions are approved and loaded successfully
​​Big Sur and later:

For macOS Big Sur 11.0 and later, to verify the Falcon system extension is enabled and activated by the operating system, run this command at a terminal:

systemextensionsctl list
The output shows the com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent system extension

enabled active teamID bundleID (version) name [state]
* * X9E956P446 com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent (5.38/119.57) Agent [activated enabled]


Q. What are the Full Disk Access, Notifications and Network configurations for the falcon sensor for macOS?A. Yes. Full Disk Access is recommended for Mojave and required for Catalina and later. ​​You must grant Full Disk Access on each host. Administrator account permission is required:1. Click the Apple icon and open System Preferences, then click Security & Privacy.2. On the Privacy tab, if privacy settings are locked, click the lock icon and specify the password.3. In the left pane, select Full Disk Access.4. In the right pane, click the plus icon.5. In finder, find Falcon in the list of applications, or use Cmd+Shift+G to and navigate to for CS sensor version 6.x:  /Applications/Falcon.app6. Click Open7. Big Sur and later select Agent.8. Click the lock icon to re-lock privacy settings.                          Enable Notification to be alerted when CrowdStrike takes actions: System Preferences - Notifications & FocusNetwork: System Preferences - Network (this should be automatically added). If it is not added open a terminal shell and enter this command: Sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl enable-filterQ. Will it slow my computer down?
A. There is no perceptible performance impact on your computer. The Falcon sensor’s design makes it extremely lightweight (consuming 1% or less of CPU) and unobtrusive: there’s no UI, no pop-ups, no reboots, and all updates are performed silently and automatically.
Q. Will it prevent me from using my applications?
A. CrowdStrike uses multiple methods to prevent and detect malware. Those methods include machine learning, exploit blocking and indicators of attack. That said, unless specifically configured, CrowdStrike will NOT block legitimate applications.
In the event CrowdStrike has blocked legitimate software/process then please submit a ticket with as much detail as you can and the Information Security Office will review the circumstances and add an exception/unquarantine files if approved.  Once an exception has been submitted it can take up to 60 minutes to take effect.  
 
Q. What data is sent to the CrowdStrike servers?
A. CrowdStrike Falcon is designed to maximize customer visibility into real-time and historical endpoint security events by gathering event data needed to identify, understand and respond to attacks — but nothing more. This default set of system events focused on process execution is continually monitored for suspicious activity. When such activity is detected, additional data collection activities are initiated to better understand the situation and enable a timely response to the event, as needed or desired. Note that the specific data collected changes as we advance our capabilities and in response to changes in the threat landscape. Information related to activity on the endpoint is gathered via the Falcon sensor and made available to the customer via the secure Falcon web management console.
Detailed Sensor Event List
Q. How can I tell if there have been any threats blocked on my computer?
A. On Windows, CrowdStrike will show a pop-up notification to the end-user when the Falcon sensor blocks, kills, or quarantines. These messages will also show up in the Windows Event View under Applications and Service Logs. Sample popups:




macOS 
Q. Why do I need an uninstall Token?
A. Modern attacks by Malware include disabling AntiVirus on systems. CrowdStrike Falcon tamper protection guards against this.  Uninstall Tokens can be requested with a HelpSU ticket.  See How do I uninstall CrowdStrike for more information. 
Q. How do I uninstall CrowdStrike?
A. Windows: you can uninstall from Program & Features {submit maintenance token}
A. macOS: Open a terminal window and enter this command
[IMPORTANT] These steps need to be taken BEFORE running the uninstall on macOS
Check Security and Privacy - Full Disk Access and ensure Agent and CrowdStrike are listed if not add them.  (See FAQ: Q. What are the Full Disk Access, Notifications and Network configurations for the falcon sensor for macOS?)Remove the Jamf MDM profile. Removing the profile ensures Jamf will not auto reinstall CrowdStrike in 5 min however when removing the profile it also removes the profiles providing Full Disk Access to CrowdStrike which is needed to allow the uninstall to proceed.  Note: If you are on VENTURA and newer OS you must add the [Terminal App] to [Security & Privacy] -[App Managment] (see  FAQ: Q. What to do if you run into uninstall issues with Ventura)
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall --maintenance-token (enter) {submit maintenance token}

If BigFix and or JAMF is installed, you MUST FIRST REMOVE these applications or CrowdStrike will/may be reinstalled automatically. Uninstalling because it was auto installed with BigFix and you are a Student.  Students should rerun the BigFix installer and select SU Group: Students to not have CrowdStrike re-installed. If you are uninstalling CrowdStrike for Troubleshooting; CrowdStrike will automatically be installed in 24 hours for Windows.  At this time macOS will need to be reinstalled manually.When the System is Stanford owned.  Many departments have opted to have their systems installed with CrowdStrike so if you are requesting for an uninstall token for reasons other than troubleshooting and it is blocking a legitimate application/process please the FAQ on “Will it prevent me from using my applications?” for a resolution.If you are a current student and had CrowdStrike installed.  It is likely due to the fact that when you installed BigFix you selected a department that has opted in to have machines installed with CrowdStrike.  Before removing CrowdStrike you will need to run the BigFix installer and select SU Group: Students to be exempted. School of Medicine Student and Staff enrolled in the SOM Data Security Program are required to have CrowdStrike installed.  This includes personally owned systems and whether you access high risk data or not.  
1.  The CrowdStrike Agent ID is a unique identifier for you machine and helps in locating your machine in the event there are duplicate machine names.  
Manually querying for your agent id:
Windows: reg query HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\CSAgent\Sim\ /f AGmacOS: sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats | grep agentID

 
Q. What to do if you run into uninstall issues with Ventura
Symptoms:When using “falconctl uninstall” to remove the sensor, Falcon.app may not be removed from the Applications folder
Users may also be presented with an error message in Terminal indicating that they do not have permission to modify files in Applications
Terminal should now be able to fully remove Falcon.app.
Cause:
A new security feature in macOS Ventura 13 was introduced to allow only authorized applications the permission to modify installed apps
Resolution:
Add Terminal or other applications that uninstall Falcon to the App Management list:
On the Ventura host, open Settings
Select Privacy & Security
Select App Management
Use the plus (+) button to navigate to Applications, then Utilities, and select Terminal
You may be prompted to authenticate and restart Terminal for settings to take effectTerminal should now be able to fully remove Falcon.app.
Applies To:Falcon sensor for mac version 6.45 and latermacOS Ventura version 13.0 and later

Q. Does Crowdstrike support AWS, GCP, and Azure?A. Yes, Crowdstrike is supported on all cloud platforms.Q. How do I deploy Crowdstrike to my servers?A. We currently have a BigFix fixlet that can help deploy the Crowdstrike sensor to your Windows servers. For all other deployment mechanisms such as SCCM, Jamf, and Puppet, we can provide the latest version of installers.Q. What are some of the requirements for a successful Crowdstrike sensor deployment?
A. The following are a list of requirements:
Supported operating systems and kernelsPort 443 outbound to Crowdstrike cloud from all host segmentsProxies - sensor configured to support or bypassSSL inspection bypassed for sensor trafficTLS 1.2 enabled (Windows especially)Both required DigiCert certificates installed (Windows)
Q. What firewall rules do I need for my server(s)? What do I do if my server is behind a proxy?A. The Falcon Sensor communicates over port 443 and connects to the following two domains during normal operation:      ts01-b.cloudsink.net      lfodown01-b.cloudsink.netThe static IPs that are associated with these domains are maintained through address group ""g_crowdstrike"" in Netdocs. When updating firewall rules, please ensure you have an outbound rule that includes the destination address is equal to ""g_crowdstrike"" and ""Service"" is equal to ""443t"".Alternatively, here are the static IPs to configure your routing tables if needed:

Q. What is the command to install Crowdstrike on a host behind a proxy?A. For windows, using an elevated cmd prompt, the command is as follows:WindowsSensor.exe /install /quiet /norestart CID=enteryourCIDhere APP_PROXYNAME=enteryourproxyserverhere APP_PROXYPORT=enteryourporthere ProvWaitTime=3600000Please contact us for fixlet information in BigFix for bulk deployments.Q. How do I check if the Windows sensor is running?A. Running the following command is a standard step for troubleshooting the Falcon Sensor for Windows that to not only looks for the existence of a sensor, but verifies that it is actively running:
cmd = ""sc query csagent""
The output of this should return something like this:
        C:\Users\user> sc query csagent
        SERVICE_NAME: csagent        TYPE               : 2  FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER        STATE             : 4  RUNNING                                 (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)        WIN32_EXIT_CODE      : 0  (0x0)        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)        CHECKPOINT                 : 0x0        WAIT_HINT                     : 0x0
If the state reports that the service is not found, but there is not a CrowdStrike folder (see above): This is expected; proceed with deployment.
If the state reports that the service is not found, but there is a CrowdStrike folder (see above): There is a sensor present, but there is a problem with the Sensor.
If the state reads STOPPED: The sensor is present but not running, so there is a problem with the Sensor.
If the STATE returns STOPPED, there is a problem with the Sensor.  The next thing to check if the Sensor service is stopped is to examine how it's set to start.           Do this with: ""sc qc csagent""
       The response should look like:
        [SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
        SERVICE_NAME: csagent        TYPE                                : 2  FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER        START_TYPE                 : 1   SYSTEM_START        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL        BINARY_PATH_NAME     : \??\C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\CrowdStrike\csagent.sys        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   : FSFilter Activity Monitor        TAG                              : 0        DISPLAY_NAME       : CrowdStrike Falcon        DEPENDENCIES       : FltMgr        SERVICE_START_NAME :The important thing on this one is that the START_TYPE is set to SYSTEM_START.  The Sensor should be started with the system in order to function.  If this setting has been changed, perform the following: ""sc config csagent start= system""
Then start the service (no reboot required): ""sc start csagent""
You should receive a response that the csagent service is RUNNING.
If the csagent service fails to start to a RUNNING state and the start type reads SYSTEM, the most likely explanation is some form of Sensor corruption, and reinstalling the Sensor is the most expedient remediation.
Q. How do I verify Linux sensor connectivity?
Verifying that the sensor is running
Check running processes to verify the Falcon sensor is running: ps -e | grep -e falcon-sensor 
Check kernel modules to verify the Falcon sensor's kernel modules are running: lsmod | grep falcon 
Check the Falcon sensor's configurable options: sudo /opt/CrowdStrike/falconctl -gOptional parameters: 
--aid: the sensor's agent ID (Please feel free to  contact ISO for help as needed) 
--cid: your Customer ID (Please feel free to  contact ISO for help as needed) 
--apd: the sensor's proxy status (enabled or disabled) (This is only applicable if your host is behind a proxy server) 
--aph: the sensor's proxy host 
--app: the sensor's proxy port 
--version: the sensor's version number 
The sensor requires these runtime services:
network 
systemd 
local-fs 
sysinit 
multi-user 
shutdown 
Verifying the sensor files on disk
If the sensor is not running, verify that the sensor's application files exist on your host:
$ sudo ls -al /opt/CrowdStrike /opt/CrowdStrike/falcon-sensor
This should be a symlink to either:
the original sensor installation at /opt/CrowdStrike/falcon-sensor 
a sensor update package with a release build number, such as /opt/CrowdStrike/falcon-sensor3000

 
Troubleshooting Tips:
Q. How do I know if Crowdstrike is running (Windows OS)?A. To validate that the Falcon sensor for Windows , run the following cmd: sc.exe query csagentExpected output if the sensor is running:SERVICE_NAME: csagent
TYPE               : 2  FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVER
STATE              : 4  RUNNING
                       (STOPPABLE, NOT_PAUSABLE, IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
WIN32_EXIT_CODE    : 0  (0x0)
SERVICE_EXIT_CODE  : 0  (0x0)
CHECKPOINT         : 0x0
WAIT_HINT          : 0x0You can verify that the host is connected to the CrowdStrike cloud by running the following via an elevated cmd prompt:netstat.exe -fA successful connection will look like the following:
Active Connections
 
Proto   Local Address State     Foreign Address
TCP     192.0.2.130:49790    ec2-54-219-145-181.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:https  ESTABLISHED* In this example, ec2-54-219-145-181 indicates a connection to a specific IP address in the CrowdStrike cloud, 54.219.145.181 Q. How do I know if Crowdstrike is running (macOS)?A. Run this terminal command to determine if the host can connect to the cloud:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl statsIn the output, look for the Cloud Info section. A value of State: connected indicates the host is connected to the CrowdStrike cloud. Any other result indicates that the host is unable to connect to the CrowdStrike cloud.
Cloud Info
     IP: ts01-b.cloudsink.net
     Port: 443
     State: connected Cloud Activity
     Attempts: 1
     Connects: 1Look for the Events Sent section and the SensorHeartbeatMacV4 event in the output. Ensure that sensor heartbeats are being sent every two minutes.

Verify the CrowdStrike system extensions has been allowed:
Sensor versions 6.11 and above on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
Confirm if the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor system extension has been allowed:
systemextensionsctl list
The output shows the com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent system extension:
1 extension(s) --- com.apple.system_extension.endpoint_security enabled active teamID bundleID (version) name [state] * * X9E956P446 com.crowdstrike.falcon.Agent (5.38/119.57) Agent [activated enabled] 
Verify the CrowdStrike directories and files are present:
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
If you look for the presence of the Falcon.app directory and files and they are present, Falcon Sensor for Mac is likely installed:
/Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/
Loading and Unloading the Mac Sensor:If you believe the Sensor is installed but not running, but should be, for troubleshooting purposes, the Mac Sensor can be unloaded and loaded locally:
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
To unload:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl unload
This takes a few moments. The --maintenance-token switch may be required if your installation uses a maintenance token.
To load with maintenance token:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl unload --maintenance-token hit {Enter}enter the maintenance token informationTo load without maintenance token:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl load
Q. What are the steps where MyDevices is indicating CrowdStrike Anti-malware is not running (for macOS)?Symptoms:A. Occasionally we receive cases from IT members deploying the Falcon Sensor for MacOS where after a successful deployment of the sensor, the sensor fails to report into the Falcon console, which then translates to MyDevices.Cause:The cause of this issue has almost universally resulted from failing to follow up on the installation with the required step of applying the CID with Checksum (CCID) value to license the new sensor to the correct Falcon instance. 
If you have an existing Sensor install that is failing to connect, remove it first:

Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall

If the update policy has Uninstall and maintenance protection enabled, include the --maintenance-token argument at the end.sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl uninstall --maintenance-token {Enter}enter the maintenance token ID and hit {Enter} again

Note that the maintenance token can be obtained by contacting the UIT Service Desk team as a first line.
Also, ensure you are using a copy of the latest version/build installer. We always recommend using the latest available installer.
Open the .pkg file to run the installer. Alternatively, open a terminal and run:
$ sudo installer -verboseR -package <installer .pkg file> -target /
When prompted, enter credentials with software installation permissions. (This won't happen for JAMF deployments.)
Use the falconctl tool (built into the installer) to license and launch the sensor after installation, passing in your CID with Checksum (CCID):
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
Example for EDR:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl license xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
If you follow the above steps and continue to have issues getting your newly installed sensor to check in, please collect the following, substituting your actual hostname for $HOSTNAME and generate a SNOW ticket to ISO:
The output of Falcon sensor diagnostic.
$ sudo cp /private/tmp/falconctl_diagnose_*.tgz ~/$HOSTNAME_falconctl_diagnose.tgz
$ cp /var/log/system.log* ~/
$ cp /var/log/install.log ~/$HOSTNAME-install.log
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura: $ systemextensionsctl list > ~/$HOSTNAME-systemextension.txt
Q. Uninstall Mac sensor error - Error: The sensor has not loaded.%
A. Symptoms:
The Mac sensor for CrowdStrike was not loaded correctly.
Applies To:
Mac SensorUninstall and maintenance protection turned on
Resolution:
Verify the current state of the sensor:
Sensor versions 6.11 and above, on macOS Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura:
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats
If you receive the following error:Error: The sensor has not loaded.% sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl unloadIf the output requires a maintenance token, the sensor has tamper protection enabled. The next step will be to obtain the maintenance token with the Service Desk team. If an escalation is required, the SD team will coordinate with ISO.Then run:sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl unload --maintenance-token hit {Enter}enter the maintenance token informationRun this command in the terminal to load the sensor: sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl load
After the sensor is loaded, you can proceed with uninstalling the sensor.
If Falcon is not yet licensed. Use the 'license' command first.% appears where:Error: InstallGuard is not ready%[Current Time] sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl loadError: Falcon is not yet licensed. Use the 'license' command first.%Cause
    The sensor is not licensed to your CustomerID (CID)    This is a required and separate step after the Falcon sensor for Mac installation is completed; the sensor installation is considered to be incomplete until it is licensed. 
After installing the Falcon sensor for Mac, remember to license the sensor by using this command, replacing <CCID> with your Falcon instance's CustomerID with Checksum (CCID):
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl licenseExample: sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl license xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Q. Uninstall Mac sensor error - Installguard is not ready, part 2
A. Symptoms:When attempting to uninstall CrowdStrike with a maintenance token, error ""InstallGuard is Not Ready"" appears.The following are steps to help resolve this issue: 
Open a terminal and run:
 
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl stats agent_info in order to obtain agent info such as the version and agentID. This can also inform you if the agent is running successfully:
=== agent_info ===
version: 6.35.14801.0agentID: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcustomerID: [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
Sensor operational: true
Verify the version, and download the same version from Google Drive (Contact ISO on our our Slack Channel #iso-crowdstrike for access available to authorized Stanford Tech Support only].
 
To reinstall CrowdStrike, run the following:
 
$ sudo installer -verboseR -package FalconSensorMacOS.pkg -target /
 
When prompted, enter credentials with software installation permissions. (This won't happen for JAMF deployments.)
 
When the installation is complete, verify that the application is licensed appropriately:
 
sudo /Applications/Falcon.app/Contents/Resources/falconctl license [xxxxx CONTACT ISO FOR LICENSE KEY xxxxx]
 
After licensing, you should be asked to approve a Network Extension and a System Extension:

Secure Authentication,Web Login Help,"Why am I being asked to log in?
The service you requested requires that you identify yourself using your Stanford University Network (SUNet) ID. You must provide your SUNet ID and password to continue to the requested service or web page. (If you don't have a SUNet ID, see What if I don't have a SUNet ID, below.)
Under the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) protocol, your single web login gives you access to many other Stanford web sites besides the one you requested. In essence, you receive two keys when you log in: a key to the specific web site or service you requested, and a ""master"" key that opens other protected web sites as well. 
The keys last until you quit your browser program, or until they expire (they can last up to ten hours from the time of login). Always quit your browser before you leave your computer. Otherwise, someone else using the computer after you can get access to the Web—both to the sites for which you got specific keys as well as to any of the other Stanford websites that accept the master key.
What am I supposed to do?
Make sure that the web login page you see has the URL https://login.stanford.edu. Enter your SUNet ID and password and click on the Login button.
SUNet ID: Enter the login form of your SUNet ID, which is three to eight characters long.
Password: Enter the password associated with your SUNet ID. If you have forgotten your password, you can reset it yourself.
What if I don't have a SUNet ID?

Secure Authentication,Login and Two-Step Authentication FAQ,"Logging in

Q: I forgot my password. How can I log in?
A: Go to the Stanford University Accounts webpage and click the Forgot password? button, then follow the steps to reset your password.

Q: Why am I getting ""are you logging in"" messages when I'm not trying to log in?
A: If these are push-based Duo authentication prompts (i.e., Duo Push, SMS text, or Phone Call), then this could be an indication that an adversary has obtained your SUNet ID password and is attempting to log in as you. Two-step authentication is doing its job, and you should never approve an authentication prompt that you did not initiate or for which you cannot identify the source. See below for what to do about potential password compromise.This could also be the result of an application/service that you previously logged into encountering a session timeout. If the application can access a valid credential (such as a Cardinal Key certificate or cached Windows domain credential) that satisfies the SUNet ID password requirement but still requires two-step, then it will initiate a prompt on your behalf to restore the session. Some applications (i.e., NetDB, RegAdmin, self-service password reset) always require two-step authentication. Also, if you clicked the “Yes, trust browser” option in that device’s web browser, exceeding 90 days will cause the browser to prompt for two-step if you are logged in to Google Drive or any other web-SSO application. If you cannot determine the source of these prompts, see below for what to do.




Q: What should I do if I suspect my SUNet ID password might be compromised?
A: If you are receiving Duo prompts that you did not initiate, you should change your password as soon as possible. Most password compromises are the result of database breaches or successful phishing attacks, so it should not be taken as an indication that your local computer is also compromised. However, if you have any reason to suspect the computer you are working on is also compromised, please use a different computer to change your password.

Q: What if I have changed my SUNet ID password and I am still receiving Duo prompts that I did not initiate?
A: If the uninitiated Duo prompts still continue after you change your SUNet ID password (and it is unlikely the adversary could have obtained your new password), then it is more likely the result of some application attempting to recover from a session timeout on your behalf. Please restart your computer and any other remote sessions that you may have logged into. This should terminate the responsible session and allow you to approve any authentication prompts with confidence.



Q: What should I do if I suspect that I may have entered my SUNet ID password and Duo Mobile passcode into a malicious website?
A: Change your password as soon as possible using these instructions. Use your Duo Mobile passcode to two-step authenticate, as this will invalidate the previous passcode that was compromised.



Q: Why am I being prompted for my passcode when I usually use Duo push?
A: Regardless of what method Duo normally presents you, if you are presented with a two-step prompt where passcode is the only option, you should be wary. This is the most common method adversaries use to obtain your two-step credential (after previously collecting your SUNet ID password). You should cancel this session and double check the authenticity of the application link you are using.Additionally, with Duo Universal Prompt, it is no longer possible to select a default authentication method, like Duo Push, for all future two-step authentications. Instead, Duo will present you with the most secure out of the methods available to you. You may click Cancel and choose Other Options, which will then be presented to you next time (as the last authentication method from this device/browser combination).
Q: I used to receive Duo authentication prompts after entering my SUNet ID password, but now I am able to log in without two-step authentication.

A: Two-step authentication is always required after SUNet ID password authentication because a password is considered a weak form of authentication that is easily compromised. Cardinal Key is a stronger form of certificate-based authentication that some applications (i.e., Cardinal Key based VPN) deem to be sufficient, so no additional two-step authentication is required. Some highly sensitive applications (i.e., NetDB, RegAdmin, self-service password reset) will always prompt for two-step authentication even after Cardinal Key authentication.​This may also be because you are logging in with the same device/browser combination where you clicked the “Yes, trust browser” option.  If so, the browser will automatically remember you, and you will not be prompted to authenticate for that application or service for the next 90 days.



Q: Why are Duo Mobile passcodes no longer sufficient?
A: The Duo Mobile passcode remains valid until it, or a subsequently-generated passcode, is used. They are vulnerable to phishing attacks that are intricately designed to steal them before they expire, thus allowing malicious users to gain access to systems and user data. If you use Duo Mobile passcode, you should switch to a more secure authentication option, such as Duo Mobile Push, or use a security key. After Feb. 23, 2023, the Duo Mobile Passcode authentication method will be disabled.

Using two-step authentication devices and methods

What is the recommended two-step authentication method?
If you can authenticate with a smartphone or tablet, Duo Push is the recommended method; it is quick, simple, and secure. 
How can I use two-step authentication without a smartphone?
Authentication with a security key does not require an internet connection, cellular connection, or separate device. A security key can be ordered and self-enrolled by following these instructions. Tokens are available from the Stanford ID Card office.
You can also authenticate by a call to a mobile phone or a call to a landline.

My device does not have an internet or cellular connection when I travel. How can I use two-step authentication?
You can authenticate with the Duo Mobile app passcode, which requires a device but does not require an internet or cellular connection.
My default two-step authentication device has changed. How do I reset it?

The new prompt does not offer a way to configure a default authentication device (see ""Universal Prompt"" on the Duo support webpage).  Therefore, you can no longer set a default authentication method by navigating to accounts.stanford.edu and selecting the ""Two-Step Management"" tile.
Instead, you will always be prompted for your last-used authentication method.  If you select an option and authenticate with it, you will automatically be prompted with it until you authenticate with a different method. To choose a different authentication method from what is initially provided in the prompt, select “Other options."" ​

How do I change my default two-step authentication device?

The new prompt does not offer a way to configure a default authentication device (see ""Universal Prompt"" on the Duo support webpage).  Therefore, you can no longer set a default authentication method by navigating to accounts.stanford.edu and selecting the ""Two-Step Management"" tile.
Instead, you will always be prompted for your last-used authentication method.  If you select an option and authenticate with it, you will automatically be prompted with it until you authenticate with a different method. To choose a different authentication method from what is initially provided in the prompt, select “Other options."" 

How can I get a security key for two-step authentication?
Purchase your choice of Yubikey and self-enroll it as a security key.
Can I use a printed list to authenticate?
You can no longer request a printed list for two-step authentication.
If you use a printed list for two-step authentication, choose one of these simple and reliable alternatives:


If you can authenticate with a smartphone or tablet, Duo Push is the recommended method; it is quick, simple, and secure.


Use the Duo Mobile app passcode, which requires a device but does not require an internet or cellular connection.


If you need to authenticate without an internet connection, cellular connection, and/or a smartphone or tablet:


A security key can be ordered and self-enrolled by following these instructions.


Use a hardware token, which is available from the Stanford ID Card office.


Use a call to a mobile phone or a call to a landline (not recommended).





Can I use SMS (text message) to authenticate?
University IT does not recommend using SMS for two-step authentication, because the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has reported that SMS authentication is less secure than other two-step authentication options. If you authenticate using SMS, consider changing to Duo Push. This recommended method is quick, simple, and secure. You can review other ways to authenticate on the Two-Step Authentication website.
 I self-enrolled my YubiKey as a Security key, but need to two-step authenticate for Shell Access and other non-web based services. How can I get my YubiKey to prompt for a YubiKey passcode?
​Firstly, ensure that your YubiKey can be programmed with a passcode, such as the YubiKey 5 Series. Then submit a HelpSU ticket requesting passcode programming for an existing YubiKey. A trained Duo administrator will schedule a working session to assist you.

Troubleshooting two-step authentication

I lost my two-step authentication device and don't have access to a backup device. How can I use two-step authentication?
You can generate a one-time bypass code on the Stanford University Accounts webpage using your University ID card and the answer to your password reset question.
I'm setting up a two-step authentication device but I want to cancel the setup. How do I cancel it?
It is a known Duo bug that there is no option to cancel the device setup process. We have reported this to Duo. As a workaround,  you can close the browser window and navigate back to the site to stop the setup process.
Why was I not asked to do legacy two-step authentication with web.stanford.edu?
Starting December 2023, duplicate multiple-factor authentication will be retired. See ""How to Fix Two-Step Authentication Issues with WebAuth Websites"" for more details.
My two-step authentication content does not load. What should I do?
If the two-step authentication content does not load, try disabling your ad blocker or third-party browser extensions.
My browser does not auto-fill the login address. What should I do?
If your browser doesn't auto-fill, it may be because you use a password manager. Login.stanford.edu uses a new URL so you need to re-enter your username and password in the password manager."

Secure Authentication,Revoke a Cardinal Key,"Revoking a Cardinal Key means that it is canceled and cannot be reinstated because the Cardinal Key can no longer be trusted. Revoking a Cardinal Key deletes it from the server but does not delete it from the client device.
Cardinal Keys are revoked automatically when certain situations occur, such as:
Cardinal Key owner is no longer affiliated with Stanford.The device is permanently removed from MyDevices.The device has been purged from AirWatch (MDM) or BigFix due to lack of activity.The device that presents the Cardinal Key does not match the device to which the Cardinal Key was issued. (In this case, the Information Security Office would revoke your Cardinal Key.)
You can manually revoke a Cardinal Key, which you would want to do if your device is lost or stolen. 
To revoke a Cardinal Key:
Log in to MyDevices. Click the link for the device on which the Cardinal Key is installed that you want to revoke. On the Device Details page, locate the Cardinal Key Information section and click View details.Note: A Cardinal Key is a digital certificate installed on your device. In the Cardinal Key Details window, click Revoke Cardinal Key. Enter the reason you are revoking this Cardinal Key, and then click Revoke. The Cardinal Key will be revoked in a few minutes.

Secure Authentication,High Risk Data in Stanford Google Drive,"Cardinal Key is required in order to store High Risk Data (including PHI) in Stanford’s Google Drive and Microsoft O365 environments. Cardinal Key ensures that devices used to access these data meet the university’s cybersecurity requirements. If you will be only sharing PHI data with internal Stanford community members,  follow the steps below to facilitate workgroup integration for easier user management:

If you don't already have it installed, set up Cardinal Key on each of your devices:

For laptops/desktops, we now have an installer to simplify the process.
Once installed, you can test each of your devices and browsers via https://cardinalkey-test.stanford.edu.
For mobile devices (iOS only), use these installation instructions.


Prepare a separate workgroup for Cardinal Key enforcement:

Create a new workgroup via https://workgroup.stanford.edu → Create a New Workgroup.
Enable Google Group integration: Select your new workgroup → Workgroup Integration → click Link in the Google Group row.

The integration does not take effect immediately. Check back on this page for confirmation of when the integration has been established.


Add members to the workgroup who will be accessing the High Risk Data.
Notify the members that they will need to use Cardinal Key for access to Stanford’s Google services.


Notify ISO of your new workgroup via a Help request so it can be enabled for Cardinal Key enforcement. Await confirmation before proceeding to Step 4.
For Google Drive: Prepare a dedicated shared drive specifically for storing the High Risk Data in Google.

Create the shared drive in Google: https://drive.google.com → Shared drives → New.
Restrict access to the share drive: Select the drive → Shared drive settings:

Uncheck “People outside Stanford University can be added to files.”
Uncheck “People who aren't shared drive members can be added to files.”


Grant the workgroup access to your shared drive: select the drive → Manage members.



Once the steps above have been completed, you can adjust access at any time by adding/removing members to/from your workgroup.

Overview
Two-step authentication uses two forms of authentication to verify your identity. First, you enter your SUNet ID and password. Then you need a physical device such as your mobile phone, tablet, or landline phone to complete the login. This approach protects your Stanford account from fraudulent access.
There are seven physical devices that you can use to provide the second factor of two-step authentication. Each device has one or more authentication methods available.

One device must be designated as your default device, and your default device must have a preferred way to authenticate. Stanford Login prompts you to authenticate using your default device and preferred method but you have the option of authenticating using a different device (if you have other devices set up) or method.
You are strongly encouraged to set up a backup device in case your primary device is lost or unavailable.
What to expect with two-step authentication
Once you enable two-step authentication, you may see an extra page after you sign into a Stanford resource via Login. If you are using a browser that you previously used to authenticate, you will be presented with the last-used authentication method. To choose a different authentication method from what is provided initially in the prompt, you can select Other options to choose one of the other options that may be available to you. How frequently you are asked to authenticate on your default device varies, depending upon:

the website you're accessing (for added security, some sites always require a two-step authentication)
your individual browser settings (whether or not you clear cookies)
whether or not you use more than one computer and web browser (two-step authentication is requested at least every 90 days for each computer and each browser you use to access protected websites)
if you are prompted with a screen that asks if you want to trust the browser. You’ll have the option to select “Yes, trust browser.” This takes the place of the “Remember Me” screen. If you click “Yes, trust browser” the browser will automatically remember you, and you will not be prompted to authenticate for that application or service for the next 90 days.

How you authenticate depends upon the device and method you chose for two-step authentication: 

If you chose Duo Mobile push notifications: a push notification is sent to the device, and you can review the request and tap Approve to authenticate. Internet or cellular access is required.
If you chose SMS text message: you receive a text message on your device containing a passcode. Enter the passcode on the two-step authentication screen to authenticate.
If you chose Phone Call: you receive an automated phone call that requires you to press or tap any key on your phone to authenticate.
If you chose Security Key: press the Security Key sensor when prompted to authenticate.

Overview
As part of an improved and simplified Cardinal Key experience, we are introducing a new browser experience for two-step authentication.

You’ll see a few screen changes, but everything will work much the same as now and will stay just as easy to use.
The core functionality of Duo Mobile isn’t changing. You’ll still be able to receive a Duo push and do anything the current version of the app does.
With the new screens, you'll see a changed URL in the address bar.  Currently, when you need to verify, the prompt displays within the Stanford login webpage with a login.stanford.edu URL. After the update, you’ll be directed to a webpage hosted with a duosecurity.com URL. 
With the change, you'll always be prompted for your last-used authentication method and can no longer set a default method.

Changes to the login experience

If you use Cardinal Key, the Stanford login screen you’re familiar with will be replaced by a “Select a certificate” pop-up when it's time to authenticate. If you see the pop-up shown below, simply select OK. This pop-up prompt replaces the Stanford login screen.Note: Those who are not yet using Cardinal Key will continue to enter a SUNet ID and password on the Stanford login screen, as usual.
For websites and applications that require two-step authentication, you’ll see a revised browser-based prompt to verify your two-step authentication.Note: Instead of showing the Duo prompt within a page hosted by the application [login.stanford.edu], the link will now redirect to a page hosted by Duo at [duosecurity.com] to show the Duo prompt and then redirect back to the protected application after completing the two-factor authentication.

When prompted for Two-Step Authentication, you will always be offered your last-used authentication method. If you choose Push as an authentication method, a login request will be sent to your device. 
To choose a different authentication method from what is provided initially in the prompt, you can select Other options to choose one of the other options that may be available to you.


Your next steps are the same as before. Open the Duo Mobile app on your device. You may see a message saying that you have a request waiting, displayed at the top of your screen. Tap the message.
Tap Approve to authenticate. If you get a request you were not expecting, tap Deny.
Once you have authenticated, you might see a screen that asks if you want to trust the browser. You’ll have the option to select “Yes, trust browser.” This takes the place of the “Remember Me” screen. 

If you click Yes, trust browser the browser will automatically remember you, and you will not be prompted to authenticate for that application or service for the next 90 days.
If you select No, do not trust this browser, you will still authenticate and continue onto your desired site; however, you will be prompted to re-authenticate each time you log into an application on that browser. 
Remember, public or shared computers shouldn’t be saved as trusted browsers.



Changes to devices & settings
The new prompt does not offer a way to configure a default authentication device (see ""Universal Prompt"" on the Duo support webpage).  Therefore, you can no longer set a default authentication method by navigating to accounts.stanford.edu and selecting the ""Two-Step"" tab.
Instead, you will always be prompted for your last-used authentication method.  If you select an option and authenticate with it, you will automatically be prompted with it until you authenticate with a different method. To choose a different authentication method from what is initially provided in the prompt, select “Other options.""

Secure Authentication,Cardinal Key FAQs,"Improving the Cardinal Key ExperienceYou shared your feedback with us, and we've heard you. The result: a substantially improved Cardinal Key user experience is on the way. Cardinal Key Frequently Asked QuestionsSelf Help for the two most common Cardinal Key errors, see our Cardinal Key Known Issues page known-issues.Learn more about Cardinal Key by visiting cardinalkey.stanford.edu. Q. How does Cardinal Key protect my computer?A. Cardinal Key ensures that devices meet our MinSec requirements (per MyDevices) regardless of location.Q. Why does Safari always prompt me to select which Cardinal Key to use when I authenticate to a Stanford website?A. You can eliminate the prompt by associating an ""identity preference"" with the certificate in the Keychain Access app.
	Open the Keychain Access app by navigating to Applications  > Utilities > Keychain Access.app.In the Keychains section, click login and then in the Category section click My Certificates.If there's more than one Cardinal Key, you might want to delete older ones before proceeding. This isn't necessary but can reduce confusion and clutter.Right-click the Cardinal Key certificate you want Safari to use and then click New Identity Preference.In the New Identity Preference Location or Email Address field, enter https://login.stanford.edu/ and click Add.
	Q. Why does my Cardinal Key stop working after two days?A. Devices must be compliant in MyDevices in order to use the Cardinal Key service. This rule applies to all users, regardless of affiliation. There is a two-day grace period after the initial installation of a Cardinal Key during which it may be used on a non-compliant device, or on a device whose compliance status is unknown. Once the grace period expires, the Cardinal Key will become unusable until the compliance problem is addressed.Q. How does Cardinal Key protect against phishing?A. Using Cardinal Key means no longer being prompted for a SUNet ID and password. If you DO encounter a Stanford-looking login page asking for a username and password while using Cardinal Key, you should be suspicious of a phishing attempt.Q. I have Cardinal Key installed on my device. Why am I still being prompted for two-factor authentication?
	A. Cardinal Key replaces the need to provide your SUNet ID and password. Depending on the system, the frequency may vary, but you will still need to two-factor in. Learn more about two-step authentication. 
	Q. Which Stanford sites require me to log in with a Cardinal Key?A. The campus-wide Cardinal Key rollout is to enforce the use of Cardinal Key when logging into webmail.stanford.edu, axess.stanford.edu, and Google Docs (this would include *.google.com).Q. Why can’t I join the eduroam network with my Cardinal Key?

Secure Authentication,Windows: Connect to the Stanford VPN with a Cardinal Key,"Non-Stanford Devices that are managed by BigFix/VLRE and are compliant can use Cardinal Key to sign into VPN without multifactor authentication.
Note: If your device is not compliant, you will be unable to use Cardinal Key to connect to the Cisco Secure VPN.
You can connect to the Stanford VPN using a Cardinal Key on your device to authenticate. This eliminates the need to enter your SUNet ID, password, and authentication method for two-step authentication.
You'll need to use the Cisco Secure Client VPN client to connect to the Stanford VPN with a Cardinal Key.
Two types of Cardinal Key VPN connections are available:

CardinalKey-VPN (split-tunnel) allows access to anything at stanford.edu via the VPN connection but non-Stanford traffic flows normally on an unencrypted internet connection.
CardinalKey-FullTraffic (non-split-tunnel) encrypts all internet traffic from your computer but may inadvertently block you from using resources on your local network, such as a networked printer at home. However, this also allows access to library journals as if you were on campus.

Before you begin
Make sure you have the following installed on your device:

A Cardinal Key for Windows
Cisco Secure Client VPN client for Windows

Connect to the Stanford VPN using a Cardinal Key for Windows

Launch the Cisco Secure Client client. If you don't see Cisco Secure Client in the list of programs,  navigate to Cisco > Cisco Secure Client. 
When prompted for a VPN, enter su-vpn.stanford.edu and then click Connect. 
If you are prompted to select a certificate for authentication, then please select Stanford University MyDevices Intermediate CA certificate and click OK. 
In the Group list, select either CardinalKey-VPN  or CardinalKey-FullTraffic and then click OK.Note: This step downloads the Cardinal Key certificate for subsequent connections; it doesn't use the Cardinal Key for authentication on this connection.  
A notice briefly appears in the notification area to show that you are connected to su-vpn.stanford.edu. 
If you no longer require a VPN connection, click Disconnect to disconnect from su-vpn.stanford.edu. 
From the Cisco Secure client, select CardinalKey-VPN  or CardinalKey-Full Traffic.Once you have successfully connected to the Stanford VPN using a Cardinal Key, this becomes your default setting for subsequent connections to the VPN.

Secure Authentication,Do I need VPN to access Stanford systems remotely?,"Many commonly used Stanford applications and services are available directly from the Internet without the use of VPN. While VPN does encrypt your data in transit, nearly all of the web-based applications you access already default to secure https communication, and are therefore already encrypted.
Examples of commonly used Stanford services which do not require VPN:
Office 365ZoomWebExAxessOracle FinancialsCisco JabberSlackGoogle DriveG Suite
University IT (UIT) recommends that you do not enable your VPN connection. Using VPN adds unnecessary additional overhead, which may degrade the user experience while connected, especially for video conferencing, streaming services, or applications.
Refer to the Learn more section on the VPN service page to view the most up-to-date FAQs."
Secure Authentication,I need to enable VPN. Do I use the split-tunnel or full-tunnel profile?,"If you do require a VPN connection, UIT recommends that you use the split-tunnel profile rather than full-tunnel. The split-tunnel profile enables the Internet-bound traffic to flow directly outbound via your home ISP, without first going to the Stanford VPN, and then route to the Internet. This also ensures better performance overall. Please remember that when using the full-tunnel profile, all traffic from your system routes first through the Stanford VPN and then out to the Internet.

Secure Authentication,Delete a Cardinal Key on a Windows Device,"For compliance, please remove multiple Cardinal Keys. Having multiple Cardinal Keys can result in the Cardinal Key failing to authenticate access to restricted resources such as Google Drive for some users. 
Cardinal Keys are partially removed when you remove your device from MyDevices. Your computer record is removed from MyDevices and GetCardinalKey.stanford.edu, but the certificate remains on your device and needs to be removed manually. Please follow the steps below. If you do not plan on connecting your device to the Stanford network, then it is not necessary to remove the Cardinal Key certificate.
Before deleting a Cardinal Key, you can review the information in MyDevices to identify which Cardinal Key you want to delete. See View Your Cardinal Keys for instructions.
Either open Internet Explorer or click on Start, and search for ""Internet Options"". If you choose the latter option, skip to step three.Note: Internet Explorer is the only browser that has the functionality to delete Cardinal Keys.In Windows 10, click the Settings icon in the top-right corner and click Internet Options.In Windows 7, on the Tools menu click Internet Options.In the Internet Options window, click the Content tab.  Click Certificates and then click the Personal tab.Select the certificate (also known as Cardinal Key) you want to delete and then click Remove.Click Yes to confirm that you want to delete this certificate."
Secure Authentication,VPN Data Security,"Stanford VPN provides encryption from your computer to the Stanford VPN gateway. While Stanford VPN provides encryption between your computer and the Stanford network, be aware that other security measures, such as proper password use, operating system security patches, firewall settings, up-to-date virus scanners, and the like are still required to protect the data you are sending electronically. Please use caution and do not send your passwords or other confidential information as you would over a secure network. (Logging in to an HTTPS destination is OK.)If you are using a wireless network or are connecting from outside the Stanford network (for example, at a conference), it is recommended that you use Stanford VPN to connect to the Stanford network. (VPN use is for wired and wireless use.) If you are using a wired computer and are on the Stanford network, it is generally sufficient to use encrypted protocols such as SSH, HTTPS, and IMAPS instead of VPN. (Using VPN in this case would not measurably improve security.)"
Administrative Support,How to Create a New Workgroup with a Compliant Name,"University IT is helping Stanford University Box users migrate Box accounts owned by workgroups to Google Shared drives. To do this, we are creating Google Groups that will be the Google Shared drive owner, and are linking these with the appropriate Stanford workgroup.  
There is a known limitation in Google Drive that the name of a Google Group must be at least 9 characters long, not including the colon between stem and group name, and/or not be currently in use for a shared email box or resource calendar.
For us to migrate Box-owned workgroup accounts, we need a new Stanford Workgroup to be set up and linked to a Google Group, with a name that is longer than 9 characters - including the stem and the workgroup name.  
Action requested
If your Stanford workgroup doesn’t meet the requirements for migration, please follow the steps below to create a new workgroup and add the name to this Google sheet in the New Name column.

Technology Training,"The Requirement for Change Requests, When and Why","All production services, as well as all services with agreements that specifically state service levels and environment up-time, are subject to the Change Management process and policies.  This means that any configuration update made to a production service requires a change request, this includes things like:

apache/tomcat configuration changes
crontab updates
monitoring script changes
code updates or modifications
patching current or deploying new server/service
adding/removing users, user permission,
adding/removing memory, cpu or disk space
adding/replacing/removing any component: switch, power supply, network card, etc. 

Changes Requests are not needed for transactions within an application as the application control access and validates data being entered.  While changes within an application are not specifically required, in some cases they should be placed due to the impact of the change. If the change significantly affects the way the application works, it’s desirable to record the change so that if anything goes wrong, the change may provide clues as where to start looking. 
The goal of the Change Management process is to conduct a formal, standardized methodology in the handling of all Changes in order to be transparent on our work, prevent change-related incidents, minimize negative impact on delivery of services to our users and clients.

To improve the quality of changes by ensuring that a standard methodology is used to handle all changes and control the impact upon the day-to-day operations of the organization.
To reduce the potential for change induced incidents by providing a standard, formal, approach to handling a change.
To ensure that all changes are logged (or captured) in a centralized repository where the information can be shared by other processes.
To assess all changes based on their impact, benefit and risk to the business and to approve or decline the request for change accordingly.
To schedule all changes based on the requirements of the business, the availability of appropriate resources and in consideration of other changes being deployed.
To ensure that all changes are appropriately tested and certified and that the appropriate implementation and remediation plans are available.
To provide timely communication of change plans and schedules as well as the status of all changes to appropriate stakeholders and affected users.
To provide general reporting capabilities against the repository of changes, including trending information and specific metrics relevant to the process.

Technology Training,"Root Cause Analysis: ""5 Why's"" or ""Ishikawa diagram (Fishbone)"" (Problem Management)","Root Cause Analysis 
 
As part of Problem Management, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is the identification and description of the true cause/problem.  It includes identifying the timeline or history of events leading to the cause/problem and distinguishing between the technical or causal factors and underlying cause/problem.
 
Root Cause Analysis can be accomplished by using a variety of different techniques. The most common approaches for technology include : 
The 5 Why’s : Probably the simplest, uses interrogatives to explore the relationship underlying the incident by repeating the question “Why” to preceding answer of why.Ishikawa diagram (Fishbone) or Cause-Effect Analysis: Use of an illustrative diagram to describe various causes linked to the incident where each path  describes more detailed steps/causes. Events and Causal Factor Analysis :  identification of a series of task/actions in time sequence including environmental conditions of the task leading to the incident.Fault Tree Analysis : backward reasoning through successive refinements from general to specific.
 
The 5 Why’s  (from Wikipedia) 
""5 Whys is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem.[1] The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question ""Why?"". Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The ""5"" in the name derives from an anecdotal observation on the number of iterations needed to resolve the problem.
 
Not all problems have a single root cause. If one wishes to uncover multiple root causes, the method must be repeated asking a different sequence of questions each time.
 
The method provides no hard and fast rules about what lines of questions to explore, or how long to continue the search for additional root causes. Thus, even when the method is closely followed, the outcome still depends upon the knowledge and persistence of the people involved. "" (from Wikipedia)
Examples:
Example 1 : Application Service Impacted and users could not logon (application hung).
Why(1) was the application hung?  Answer: The server stop responding to requests.
Why(2) did server stop responding to requests?  Answer: The server ran out of disk space.
Why(3) did the server run out of disk space?   Answer: There was a significant amount or new log entries. 
Why(4) were there so many new log entries? Answer: New code migrated to production with log level set to high.
Why(5) was the new code delivered with the wrong log level setting?  Answer: Documented SDLC processes not followed (established guidelines on log level settings and code didn’t undergo performance testing).
Why(6 - optional) was the SDLC process not followed?  Answer: Management oversight lacking due to vacation schedule.
 
Example 2 : Network Device failure and clients can’t use internet to reach applications.
Why(1) was the network not available?  Answer: A network device failed.
Why(2) did the network device fail?  Answer: It was past it’s useful life (very old).
Why(3) was the network device not replaced?  Answer: The device position on the refresh list was incorrectly recorded and showed more useful life.
Why(4) was the device recorded incorrectly from the refresh list?  Answer: Visual inspection was not performed to confirm device age when the list was being update in violation of the established process. 
 
Example 3: General example of car trouble. 
Why(1) did the car stop running?.  Answer: The engine seized. 
Why(2) did the engine seize?  Answer: There was no oil left.
Why(3) was there no oil in the engine?  Answer: The oil drain plug was missing. 
Why(4) was the oil drain plug missing?  Answer: During yesterday’s oil change, the mechanic didn’t replace the oil drain plug.
Why(5) didn’t the mechanic replace the oil drain plug: Answer: The oil drain plug fell from the spot where mechanic placed it on the counter and his process is to check that location and not the oil pan before releasing the car.  (Bad process)

In such cases you should submit a compliance exception request."
Security & Compliance Consulting,How to Request Electronic Access to Stanford Accounts,"Introduction
From time to time, Stanford employees or teams may have legitimate reasons to request access to an Individual’s data stored in Stanford-managed systems (Box, Google, Outlook, file server, data backup, end-user computer, etc).
For example, when faculty or staff leave Stanford (on a permanent or temporary basis, either voluntarily or involuntarily), they may have files or communications in their individual Stanford accounts that are necessary for ongoing operations or research. Access to such individual accounts may be granted only (1) with permission of the individual account owner, or (2) in accordance with Administrative Guide 6.1.1 (Privacy and Access to Electronic Information).
This document describes the process that the University Privacy Office (UPO) recommends for requesting access to such accounts of a person departing or no longer affiliated with Stanford (Departing Person) – including the roles and responsibilities of the person or team making the request (Requester), his or her direct Stanford manager (Manager) and Administrative Officer, UPO, Information Technology (IT), Human Resources (HR), and others.
Below are two methods for obtaining access to a Departing Person’s account.
 
Method 1: Consent from the Departing Person
The easiest and most efficient way to obtain access to a Departing Person’s account is to provide evidence of prior permission (such as document editor or co-owner rights) or obtain email permission from the Departing Person, before requesting access from IT.
Here are the steps:

Provide evidence that you’ve had prior permission from the user to electronic access (e.g. screenshot of prior sharing by user to you as a fellow co-owner or co-editor), or have IT check their logs for prior access rights.
Alternatively, the Requester can obtain email consent from the Departing Person to access the relevant accounts. The consent must specify:




the name(s) of the Stanford persons/teams to receive access,
the specific accounts to be accessed (e.g., Stanford University Box, Stanford Medicine Box, Stanford-managed Google account, Stanford managed Outlook account, etc.), and
any limitations on access (e.g., if access is to be limited to specific folders, files or emails).



For convenience, Attachment 1 (“Consent Template from Departing Person”) is a template that the Departing Person can complete and send to the Requester to grant permission.

The Requester opens a ServiceNow case with IT at https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services– and attaches the email permission to the ticket.
IT provides the necessary account access to the Requester.

There is no need for the University Privacy Office, HR, or Senior Executives to review or be involved where the Departing Person gives permission in Method 1.
 
Method 2: Compliance with Stanford Admin Guide 6.1.1(4)
In limited and exceptional circumstances, the Departing Person may not be in a position to grant permission via email. For example, the Departing Person may have passed away or become incapacitated, or may have been involuntarily terminated and is no longer on good terms with Stanford.
In such cases, the Requester will need to review and comply with the requirements of Stanford Administrative Guide 6.1.1(4), and coordinate with a number of different Stanford teams. For purposes of this process document, it is assumed that subsection 6.1.1(4)(d) (“Operational Circumstances”) applies.
See https://adminguide.stanford.edu/chapter-6/subchapter-1/policy-6-1-1
Here are the steps:

If the Requester is not the Departing Person’s direct manager (Manager), the Requester coordinates with the Manager, and confirms that the Manager supports requests for electronic access.
The Manager reaches out to the relevant (a) Stanford HR Director (e.g. School of Medicine would be HR Director - Susan Hoerger) and (b) Stanford Administrative Officer (e.g., DFA, DFO, AVP, VP, Chair, Dean, Provost). The Manager explains the business justification for access to the account(s), and asks the HR Director and Administrative Officer to state in email that they support the requested access. For convenience, Attachment 2(see below “Template: Manager Email to HR Director and Administrative Officer”) is an email template that the Manager can use to document such support, which includes information required under Administrative Guide 6.1.1(4)(d) Operational Circumstances.
Once the Requester (and Manager, if different) have obtained email support from the appropriate HR Director and Administrative Officer, the Requester opens a ServiceNow case with UPO at https://privacyrequest.stanford.edu/– and attaches to the ticket the supporting emails from the HR Director and Administrative officer, obtained by the Manager in the previous step. In addition, if the Requester has previously submitted any ServiceNow tickets to IT related to the access request, the Requester should provide that IT ticket number to UPO, so the two cases can be associated.
Relying on the supporting HR and Administrative Officer emails that the request for access satisfies the conditions in Administrative Guide 6.1.1(4)(d) (e.g., if “failure to access the Information would likely cause the University to fail to meet mission-critical governance, administrative, teaching, or research obligations”), UPO will forward the HR and Administrative Officer’s emails to two “Authorizing Officials” (as defined in Administrative Guide 6.1.1(2)) – and ask for their approval. Typically, such Authorizing Officials will be Stanford’s (a) Chief Risk Officer, and (b) Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer. But depending on circumstances, the Authorizing Officials may alternatively include the University President, Provost, Vice President of Business Affairs, General Counsel, or Vice Provost of Student Affairs.
If the two Authorizing Officials approve access, University Privacy Office will then open a case at the “Request Stanford User Data Access” portal which directs IT Subject Matter Leads to fulfill the request for the Requestor’s associated IT ticket. (Concurrently, UPO will notify and close the Requester’s ServiceNow case with UPO.)
Requester coordinates directly with IT to obtain access with UPO and Two Authorizing Officials’ approval in place. Before accessing any data, Requester should understand and acknowledge the following:




By default, IT will grant access only for thirty (30) days or transfer the data if practical. If the Requester requires more time, s/he should coordinate directly with IT. In such cases, IT may require additional approvals/sponsorship of the relevant administrative officer, as there may be additional costs associated with holding the account open for a longer period.
Requester’s access to the Departing Person’s information must stay within the scope described in the approvals submitted, and must in all cases be related to the performance of Stanford’s research, educational and operational activities – consistent with the requirements set forth in Stanford Administrative Guide 6.1.1, Section 4(d).
In complying with the “minimum necessary” principle defined under Admin Guide 6.1.1 1.c.v, the Requestor must limit access to minimum necessary in order to accomplish the business purpose and onward sharing of the Departing Person’s files, folders and communications only to those specific individuals with a legitimate need-to-know to fulfill Stanford’s research, educational and operational objectives. The Requester should avoid accessing any potentially personal content in the Departing Person’s Box, Google or Outlook accounts.
In the event of any data incident (including any potential unauthorized access to personal data), the Requester must immediately report the incident to UPO at https://privacyrequest.stanford.edu/



Questions about this process should be directed to UPO, by opening a case at https://privacyrequest.stanford.edu/.

TEMPLATE: MANAGER EMAIL
TO HR DIRECTOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER
Below is a template email which can be completed and sent by the Departing Person’s Manager to request the appropriate University HR Director and Administrative Officer (e.g., DFA, DFO, AVP, VP, or Provost) to provide administrative approval.
Dear [insert names of HR Director and Administrative Officer]
I am writing to request your support of the grant of access to electronic information of a former Stanford employee. Specifically:

The following person was previously on my team, and is no longer with Stanford for the following reason: [insert name of departing person, SUNet ID, title, department, and reason why no longer at Stanford – e.g., deceased, incapacitated, involuntarily terminated, etc.]
My team does not currently have access to the Stanford-managed Box, Google, Outlook and/or other accounts or data associated with the person, and which we believe contain information necessary for us to [insert a detailed explanation of what you cannot do without access to the data, including any specific projects that will be impractical or impossible without the individual’s data].
Based on the above, as required under Stanford Administrative Guide 6.1.1(4)(d), I have determined that “failure to access the information in such accounts would likely cause the University to fail to meet mission-critical governance, administrative, teaching, or research obligations.”
Below are the specific accounts and folders of [insert name of departing person], to be transferred to and accessed by [insert name(s) of people to receive access]:
Transfer of [Stanford University Box] [Stanford Medicine Box] [Google Drive] [Other: ____] for the following folders: [insert specific folders to be transferred]
Transfer of specific Outlook emails containing the words [insert specific keywords relevant to your access, such as “research” “study” “invoices” “budget”]

[If desired, insert the following:] In addition, I am requesting that the following automatic “Out of Office” message be sent in response to emails directed to the Stanford-managed Outlook account for [insert name of departing person]:
[Insert out of office message, e.g., For all questions related to _____, please contact ________. For any other questions, please email ________.]
REQUEST: If you agree to the grant of access described above, please reply with “Yes, I have reviewed Stanford Admin Guide 6.1.1 4(d), and I agree the information request complies with mission critical operational circumstances.” to this email.
If you agree, I will then forward your reply to the University Privacy Office for review. In turn, the Privacy Office will forward your reply to the University’s Chief Risk Officer, and Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer, for final approval in accordance with the Administrative Guide. (In some circumstances, the Privacy Office may alternatively engage the University President, Provost, Vice President of Business Affairs, General Counsel, or Vice Provost of Student Affairs.)
Thanks for your support in this matter. If you have any questions, please let me know.
Regards,
[Departing Person’s Manager]"

Security & Compliance Consulting,Minimum Security Standards Frequently Asked Questions,"Compliance and Exception Process:

Q: When is a MinSec standard exception needed?
A: When a minsec standard as a whole cannot be met. For example, a minsec exception is not needed when a single, or small subset, of patches cannot be applied as specified by the Patching standard.
Q: How do I get started bringing my servers into compliance with the Stanford Minimum Security Standards (MinSec)?
A: To get started bringing your servers into compliance with the MinSec standards, the Information Security Office (ISO) has developed quick start guides for Information Security on Stanford managed Linux and Windows servers. Please see the Windows MinSec Cookbook and the Linux MinSec Cookbook for more information.
Q: What if I cannot meet some or all of the Minimum Security Standards for my servers, applications, or endpoints? Can I request a compliance exception? Who should submit the request?
A: If you cannot meet some or all of these standards for your servers or applications, please fill out the temporary Minimum Security Standards server and application exception request. These requests should be submitted by the server or application Business Owner. If you cannot meet some or all of these standards for your endpoints, please fill out the temporary Minimum Security Compliance Exception Request form. These requests should be submitted by the endpoint's primary user. See Request a MinSec Exception for more information.
Q: Is there a different process for processing exception requests for endpoints vs. servers and applications?
A: Yes. The endpoint compliance exception request form starts a review process that is managed in RedCap, while the server and application exception request starts a review process that is managed in ServiceNow.
Q: Do I need to submit a temporary exception request for each of my servers/applications?
A: You can submit one exception request for all servers/applications for which you want an exception from the same standard(s).
Q: My current system/application is not MinSec compliant, but will be replaced by a different system/application in the future. I don't want to divert resources to update a system that is going to go away in X amount of time. Can I submit a MinSec exception until the old system is decommissioned?
A: No. If a system/application is not meeting MinSec compliance, but there is a plan to replace it with a newer MinSec compliant system, the existing system will simply stay non-compliant until decommissioned.
Q: What are the eligibility criteria for a temporary Minimum Security Compliance Exception for my server or application?

A: A server or application is eligible if:

It is not supported by (up-to-date) OS or application
The OS or application cannot meet a specific minsec standard because of a technical dependency. Exception may be granted on a case-by-case basis as long as there is an upgrade plan on a system that is scheduled to be decommissioned or replaced by another system.
No updates are available for a vendor supported system
The system does not support password complexity requirements


Q: How long does a MinSec exception last?
A: An approved MinSec Temporary Exception for servers/applications will be valid for up to three years at the discretion of the Information Security Office. An approved MinSec Temporary Compliance Exception for endpoints will be valid for up to one year.
Q: I am having trouble meeting the MinSec deadline for my systems; can I get an extension by submitting an exception request?
A: Minimum Security Standards Exception Requests are intended for servers and applications that cannot meet MinSec standards, not as an extension for MinSec compliance deadlines.

Patching:

Q: I cannot patch my system because the reboot will cause an outage of the service to my end users.
A: System managers and business owners should have negotiated maintenance windows for their systems that allow for the application of security patches on a schedule that is in compliance with the Minimum Security Standards.
Q: I cannot patch my system because I am unsure whether the patches will break a custom application.
A: System managers should have test environments in place to perform impact analysis of changes to their environment. Exception requests will not be granted based on a suspicion of an impact that has not been validated by testing or vendor input.

Vulnerability Management:

Q: Where can I get an overview of my systems' information security vulnerabilities?
A: Submit a request for a Qualys account, then log in to Qualys to view vulnerabilities. For more information, see the Vulnerability Management service page.
Q: For Qualys reported vulnerabilities, do I need to address “potential” vulnerabilities or just “confirmed” vulnerabilities?
A: In order to meet MinSec compliance, both potential and confirmed vulnerabilities need to be addressed.
Q: In what order should I prioritize mitigation for potential and confirmed Severity 3/4/5 vulnerabilities?

A: Mitigation for confirmed and potential vulnerabilities should be prioritized in the order shown in the following table, ranging from 1 (highest priority) to 18 (lowest priority).
Mitigation Prioritization


Severity
Server Classification: High
Server Classification: Moderate
Server Classification: Low


5 - Confirmed

Q: If Qualys shows a vulnerability and there is no patch available from the vendor, is a MinSec exception needed?
A: No. If there is no patch from a vendor for a vulnerability reported in Qualys, a minsec exception is not needed. In the absence of a patch, explore other alternate solutions and compensating controls that may be recommended by the vendor.
Q: How do I handle false-positive vulnerabilities in Qualys?
A: If Qualys is showing a vulnerability that is investigated and found to be a false-positive, a minsec exception is not needed. Sysadmin should go into Qualys and set false-positive vulnerability as Ignored and denote that vulnerability is a false-positive in the comments section.
Q: Who is responsible for updating Qualys for false-positives?
A: Each organization is responsible for managing their own assets in Qualys, including ignoring vulnerabilities that are false positives.
Q: How can I request Qualys API access?
A: Go to https://stanford.service-now.com/services?id=get_help&cmdb_ci=acd7c11a1374e20063eadf82e144b07d and request a Qualys API account. ISO will work with you to identify the appropriate API account permissions.
Q: What does “Remediate” mean in the Vulnerability Management standard?
A: To investigate identified vulnerabilities, ignoring false-positives in Qualys, addressing any configuration problems, and/or applying patches when available from the vendor.

Whole Disk Encryption:

Q: Is the BitLocker Startup Pin required to be compliant for whole disk encryption?
A: It is highly recommended that all BitLocker features, including a startup pin, be utilized; however, the startup pin can be removed for systems that require unattended reboots.

Inventory:

Q: Who should be updating each organization's IT System Inventory worksheets each month to reflect current MinSec adoption status?
A: Each organization has designated a point person who is accountable for ensuring that their inventory worksheet and MinSec adoption status is updated on a monthly basis. Please contact your ISO Consulting liaison if you do not know who that person is. The Operations Owner for each server and/or application is responsible for informing the associated Business Owner of any changes to that server or application’s MinSec adoption status. The Operations Owner is also responsible for providing this information to their organization’s accountable point person to make the update to their inventory worksheet, unless their point person has delegated to them the responsibility and ability to update their server or application’s information in the inventory worksheet themselves.

Firewall:

Q: Do host-based firewalls have to be configured to allow port scanning by Qualys scanners?

A: Host-based firewalls should permit only the minimum necessary ports/protocols, blocking everything else that does not support a business need. A system administrator should not explicitly block Qualys scanner IP addresses.
Network-based firewalls should permit ISO vulnerability scans to pass through unfettered.


Two-Step Authentication:

Q: If I have two-step authentication on my VPN, do I still need it on my server?
A: Yes, two-step authentication must be installed on your server to comply with Minimum Security Standards. For installation instructions, see Two-Step Authentication for Servers and Applications.
Q: I am running a system that does not support two-step authentication. What is an adequate compensating control to mitigate the security risk?
A: Any authentication mechanism such as RADIUS that enforces two-step authentication is a suitable compensating control for systems that do not support native two-step authentication. Alternatively, the Stanford University Network Access Control (SUNAC) service can also be used as a compensating control.

Centralized Logging:

Q: Is sending logs to a University Splunk instance required to meet this standard?
A: While University Splunk is not required, ISO may require logs from critical systems to be sent to Splunk for security monitoring and incident investigation.

Sysadmin and Developer Training:

Q: How can I tell if someone completed a SISA class this calendar year?
A: Ask the employee to review their STARS Training History and send you their completion certificate or a screen capture of the completed course.
Q: How can I satisfy the sysadmin/developer training requirement if I cannot attend one of the in-person classes?
A: You can take one of the online (self-paced) classes which does not require previous completion of the Information Security I prerequisite.

Malware Protection:

Q: How do I satisfy the Malware Protection and Intrusion Detection MinSec standards on my Windows server?
A: Windows Servers can satisfy both of these MinSec requirements by implementing CrowdStrike

Intrusion Detection:

Q: How do I satisfy the Intrusion Detection MinSec standard on my Linux server?
A: Linux servers satisfy the Intrusion Detection requirement by implementing File Integrity Monitoring with OSSEC. Legacy systems that cannot run OSSEC can also satisfy this requirement using TripWire.

Physical Protection:

Q: What kind of data center do I need to comply with the Physical Protection MinSec standard?
A: The system administrator should use their own judgment. The intent of this standard is to ensure that servers cannot be easily stolen. Servers should be housed behind a locked door, and access should be restricted to authorized sysadmins only, preferably with a spring-loaded door, video surveillance, and a card reader. A locked office does not suffice.

Dedicated Admin Workstation:

Q: What is a PAW and who needs one?

A: Please see the Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) service page for more information about PAWs, and who is required to obtain one.


Security, Privacy, and Legal Review:

Q: Do I need to file a Privacy, Security, and Legal review for my existing systems?
A: No, a Privacy, Security, and Legal review is not needed for existing systems.

Regulated Data Security Controls:

Q: If my systems are MinSec compliant, does that mean they are also HIPAA or PCI-DSS compliant?
A: No, in order to meet specific regulatory security control requirements, your system must also meet the appropriate security requirements. For example, in order to meet HIPAA requirements, your system also has to meet the HIPAA Administrative, Technical, and Physical Security Rules."

Backup,"Installing, Uninstalling, or Reinstalling CrashPlan","These pages explain how to install the CrashPlan backup software on your computer. The instructions assume that you have obtained an up-to-date installer from your IT support team.
You may need to uninstall CrashPlan if you've previously installed a version from home or another organization,  you're transferring computers to someone else, or you have cloned your primary computer. Your IT support team may also ask you to uninstall and reinstall the software. 
To install or uninstall CrashPlan on Windows or Mac, please visit this support page."
Backup,CrashPlan Retention Policy and Archive Maintenance,"Data retention
After your computer's files have been backed up, the original and subsequent versions persist in the archive until certain time intervals are met.
Default retention policy

Every 15 minutes —any new data eligible for backup is sent to the CrashPlan backup server.
For the last seven days (not including the present day) — one unique version from every past 15 minutes is retained.
For the last 90 days (excluding the past week) — one unique file from every past day is retained.
For the last year (minus the past 90 days) — one unique file from every week is retained.
From previous years (but not including last year) — one unique version from the previous month is retained.
Any files deleted on the source computer — will not be expunged from the CrashPlan server until manually executed on the client using the ""compact archive"" command.

Should you wish to change your computer's retention policy, use the CrashPlan reference guide for backup settings.
Archive maintenance
Periodically, the CrashPlan server grooms your archives to verify the integrity of your backups, purge deleted files, and reduce the number of versions according to your retention policy. During maintenance, backups are paused and restores are unavailable. Refer to the CrashPlan documentation describing archive maintenance to learn more."
Backup,Code42 CrashPlan for Mac not Backing up Files with Personal Data,"Audience
School of Medicine users running macOS 10.14 Mojave or 10.15 Catalina.
Issue
Apple has made changes to macOS security which can prevent Code42 CrashPlan from completely backing up your data if full-disk access is not granted. A red x indicates a folder which will not back up until the Code42 CrashPlan app has been provided with full-disk access:

Backup,CrashPlan Configuration,"Default settings
For most users, the default client configuration is sufficient. Some users may wish to modify settings to accommodate specific needs; see the CrashPlan backup settings documentation for advanced options. Some settings, like encryption, are mandatory.
Should you wish to expand the scope of inclusion so more files are backed up, know that initial backups will take longer, your computer will do more work, and you’ll probably end up using the original installers for applications and operating system if you need to do a full system restore.
Certain file types are always excluded from the University IT CrashPlan backup, such as caches, files from your Stanford AFS directory, and other miscellaneous system data. You may add to the list of filenames or types of files to be excluded. See the CrashPlan file exclusions documentation.
Files and directories that have been marked for exclusion administratively by your IT support staff cannot be overridden by end users.
Data in a folder that has _NoBackup in the name (e.g., PersonalFiles_NoBackup) will always be excluded from backup. You may create this folder anywhere on your computer and CrashPlan will always ignore the contents.
Always perform a test restore to evaluate whether your settings should be adjusted to protect data.
You may choose to add a second destination for your personal backup data. CrashPlan can be configured to use an attached portable hard drive or another device running CrashPlan."

Log in using your SUNetID credentials.
Step 2: List your devices and deactivate a particular device.

Backup,CrashPlan Archive Key Password,"Archive key password
At all times, your CrashPlan data is automatically encrypted before it leaves your computer and is transmitted over a secure network connection. Although already highly secure, there are some circumstances in which you might choose to add another layer of encryption to further safeguard data from unauthorized access.
For extra security, you can add an Archive key password to your account. This advanced option should only be considered if you are comfortable managing your own backups and fastidiously handling your passwords.
The default encryption scheme is sufficient for most use cases. Consequently, as a matter of policy, some organizations disable the Archive key password option to ensure persistent data accessibility.
Limitations
Adding an Archive key password, in addition to your Account password, means that only you have access to your archives. No one, including the company that sells CrashPlan or anyone at Stanford, will be able to view your files. Importantly, your local IT support team will no longer be able restore files on your behalf if you submit a Help ticket.
If you forget your Archive key password, all your data will be inaccessible. You will need to reset all of your backups from scratch.
Get started
If you decide to add an Archive key password, the password must be applied to all your devices and all of your data will need to be re-backed-up in order to be newly encrypted. You will lose any historical archives on all your devices and you cannot downgrade to using Account key passwords only, unless you start everything again.

Contact your local IT support team to enable the enhanced Archive key password. See the CrashPlan documentation for instructions to setup and use an Archive key password.

Backup,Adjusting Memory Allocation to CrashPlan,"Adjusting the memory allocation
CrashPlan might run out of memory and crash when de-duplicating and backing up large file systems greater than 1TB or one million files. You can experiment raising maximum amount of of RAM that CrashPlan can use to prevent incomplete backups. 
Adjust app settings for memory usage with large backups (Enterprise)"
Backup,CrashPlan File Exclusions,"By default, CrashPlan service backs up your entire system to the Stanford Internet2 Cloud, excluding certain file types and directories. Virtual machine files, log files, most application directories, the operating system and other file types are excluded. Users can still choose to back up these files using external storage or to other computers in their account.
Still other files and directories are always excluded. Global exclusions include caches, ephemeral data, temp directories and incompatible file types. Additionally, any file or folder named _NoBackup will always be excluded. 
This exclusion list only applies to organizations that subscribe to the ITS settings and configurations.
Groups that locally support their CrashPlan deployment may have different includes/excludes. Check with your local IT support group for more information. Some exclusions are specific to Macs, Windows, Linux or Solaris. See what gets excluded per CrashPlan best practices."
Backup,CrashPlan Limitations and Considerations,"Appropriate use
CrashPlan is intended to protect laptops and desktops over any internet connection, for users with active SUNet accounts.
This software can no longer be newly installed on machines running Windows Server operating systems. Use on Linux servers is discouraged. CrashPlan backup service is not a substitute for a long-term storage or data archive strategy. It is intended to provide a measure of security when files are accidentally deleted, a hardware component fails or a computer is lost.
Performance
Most computers on campus will take advantage of Internet2 networking for enhanced performance. Home users with slow internet upload speeds will find reduced performance.
For best results, especially during the initial backup, use Stanford’s wired (Ethernet) network and temporarily prevent your computer from falling asleep. 
As a general rule, CrashPlan might not perform as expected on computers with more than 2 TB data or  several million files. Actual performance depends on the amount of physical RAM, network throughput, disk speeds, CPU efficiency, and other factors. Review this support article if CrashPlan is running out of memory and crashing due to large file systems. Adjust app settings for memory usage with large backups with this support article.
Additional considerations
Users who depend on cellular data networks (“tethering”) for network connectivity should configure CrashPlan to avoid using their mobile hotspot to avoid costly plan overages. See CrashPlan network configuration documentation to learn how to adjust client network settings.
Because archives are encrypted using an algorithm based on a person's SUNet credentials, they cannot be transferred to another user.  
Microsoft Outlook users must take extra precautions to make sure their data is properly protected. CrashPlan has separate support articles for backup and restore.
Special considerations should be taken when backing up certain types of open files, like databases. See CrashPlan support documentation for more information.
Do not back up virtual machine files created on your computer using applications like VMware Fusion or Parallels. Instead, install CrashPlan inside the virtual machine itself."
Backup,"Ordering, Billing, and Deploying CrashPlan","Ordering
Departments may order CrashPlan backup via OrderIT. Members of the Stanford community with an active SUNet account are eligible. Service is intended for home, office, and remote computers that are related to employment.
This service is acceptable for all risk classification types. To safeguard Protected Health Information (PHI), users with this type of data on their computer must submit a Request to ensure that all backup data is handled appropriately. 
Deploying
Deploying apps to specific organizations requires a unique deployment policy, created and maintained by a customer cloud admin role (equivalent of a system administrator). 
Organizations purchase one license per user. Each user may have up to four devices. 
To prevent unexpected charges, organizations can request a cap to the number of licenses associated with this license key. Submit a Request to later adjust the quota.
Learn more about strategies for deploying to user devices here.
Billing
This service is a ongoing subscription, with billing adjustments made each month. Subscribing organizations are billed for the actual number of licenses in use when tallied in the last week of the month. Monthly recurring charges are thus adjusted according to the actual number of licenses in use. 
Cancelling
A license is considered “in use” if the user account still has archive data in retention. Simply having a user depart your organization or Stanford, or the computer be unreachable, unused, blocked, suspended or de-authorized, does not mean the license will be automatically returned or the billing adjusted downward. Your local IT support organization that manages your CrashPlan subscription will need to manually deactivate a user account through the admin console. This will automatically and permanently delete all the data associated with that user account, and your organization will not be charged further for that license.
Refer to the Stanford Admin Guide Section 6.2.1 under the section concerning Computer and Network Usage Policy for information on the appropriate use for information resources, including CrashPlan backup service.
Installers
Installers can be downloaded from the Admin Console (use server address: http://clients.us2.crashplan.com/).
Please note that custom installers will no longer be updated."
Backup,How CrashPlan Works,"Continuous backup
CrashPlan (formerly CrashPlan PROe) provides “continuous backup” that’s different from other, more traditional backup applications. Rather than kick off a resource-intensive backup session once or twice a day, it's much more lightweight and unobtrusive. 
CrashPlan uses your computer’s built-in notification system to learn about changes to your data. It listens to your operating system to learn when files have been added, removed or modified. It queues up the eligible files, then compresses and encrypts the data prior to sending them over the network. This happens every fifteen minutes by default.
Just to make sure no files were missed, there is a once-a-day disk scan to account for any changes that might have been overlooked. This usually happens around noon each day. If your computer was turned off, that scan will take place later in the day.
Initial backup, subsequent protection
After the initial backup is complete, only the changed bytes of any given file is sent subsequently. Additionally, on a per-device basis, CrashPlan provides deduplication to make backups more efficient.
To restore data, use the secure web interface to recover a few files, or use the desktop software for larger tasks. See the CrashPlan documentation to learn about restoring files.
The integrity of your backups are verified regularly by the software. Any corruption in the backup archive will be identified and the original files are backed up again to ensure protection. 
Resource efficient
By default, CrashPlan uses minimal CPU and network resources while your computer is being used. Users can throttle the network usage to prevent disruptions on home networks, too."
Backup,Change The User Account Associated With Code42 (Formerly CrashPlan),"On June 11, 2018, the CrashPlan service for the School of Medicine was upgraded. The newer version is expected to help with a variety of bugs which have been impacting some backups and restores. Please note that the branding for CrashPlan has been changed to ""Code42"" with this upgrade and the interface and icons have also changed.

When Code42 is first configured, it requires a user to sign into their account before it can begin backing up. From that time on, Code42 will back up all data to that user's account. If another user inherits that computer, and it has not been wiped, the new user will need to sign out the previous user to change the account that Code42 backs up to.
Below are the steps to sign out the previous user in both Code42 and CrashPlan. If you still have CrashPlan, your CrashPlan will be automatically updated to Code42.
Sign out the previous user in Code42

Open the Code42 app
On a PC, press these three keys together: Ctrl, Shift, and C. On a Mac, press these three keys together: Option, Command, and C.
In the ""Commands"" window, type: deauthorize
Press Enter

After closing the command window, the sign in screen will appear. The new user can now sign in with their SUNet ID and SUNet ID password.

Tap the code to copy it to the clipboard.
Tap Settings > VPN to start the VPN connection process.
When prompted for a secondary factor,  tap the field, tap Paste, then tap OK.


Once you have MDM installed on your device, you need to turn VPN on in order to use it. The option to turn VPN on or off appears in the main Settings screen.

From your home screen, tap Settings.
On the main settings screen, tap VPN.
Tap Not Connected.
On the next screen, enter your SUNet ID password, and tap OK.
Next the prompt for two-step authentication displays. 

Enter a passcode or enter the number that corresponds to another option and then tap OK (in this example, enter 1 to authenticate using Duo Push). 
If your only registered authentication method is printed list, hardware token, or Google Authenticator, the list of options does not display. Enter a passcode  and tap OK. 
You may see a truncated menu if you  have multiple two-step devices enabled. Enter a passcode or choose a second factor from the options provided and then tap OK (in this example, enter push1 to authenticate using Duo Push). Note: It may take a bit of trial and error to associate secondary factors with devices.

Network Access,How to Configure Built-in VPN Client for Mac OS X,"The Cisco AnyConnect VPN client for Mac is recommended.  The built-in VPN client for Mac OS is another option but is more likely to suffer from disconnects.

Stanford's VPN allows you to connect to Stanford's network as if you were on campus, making access to restricted services possible.
Two types of VPN are available:
Default  (split-tunnel).  When using Stanford's VPN from home, we generally recommend using the default split-tunnel VPN. This routes and encrypts all traffic going to Stanford sites and systems through the Stanford network as if you were on campus. All non-Stanford traffic proceeds to its destination directly.Full Traffic (non-split-tunnel).  This encrypts all internet traffic from your computer but may inadvertently block you from using resources on your local network, such as a networked printer at home. If you are traveling or using wi-fi in an untrusted location like a coffee shop or hotel, you may wish to encrypt all of your internet traffic through the Full Traffic non-split-tunnel VPN to provide an additional layer of security.
The VPN type is determined by the authentication settings, which are entered during the configuration.

Network Access,Cardinal Key Resources for IT Professionals: Shared Devices,"This page includes instructions intended for IT professionals who are supporting the use of Cardinal Key on shared devices.
Instructions for IT Professionals
Prerequisites
The device must be enrolled in BigFix (eventually, Jamf should also be able to support this setup).Only macOS and Windows are supported.Each user must have their own account on the local system.Each user must be a local administrator.One user of the device (could be a sysadmin or tech support person) must be the primary user (responsible party) so that the device will appear in their list in MyDevices.
Set-up steps
It is recommended that the primary user should be the first to install their Cardinal Key. Each user must individually complete the following steps:
Complete the device enrollment process while logged on to their own local computer account.Install their own Cardinal Key, using either the guided installer or manual installation.If the guided installer was used, the process is now complete and the user may log out immediately.In the case of manual installation, the user must stay logged in long enough for BigFix to collect Cardinal Key data and report it to MyDevices. (Users should remain logged in for two hours.)
Caveats
During device enrollment, the question about High Risk data confuses some folks.  If any user (not just the primary user) says ""yes"" to High Risk data access, the computer will be considered to have High Risk data access.The device will appear in the MyDevices list of the primary user only.MyDevices can sometimes be slow to update. Allow up to 12 hours for a newly installed Cardinal Key to appear in MyDevices.The Cardinal Keys will appear with the names given them at installation time (by default either the machine name, in the case of the Cardinal Key Installer, or the OS name, in the case of a manual installation)There’s no lifecycle management: if a local user account is deleted, for example, any associated Cardinal Key will still show in MyDevices in perpetuity, even though the certificate itself was deleted along with the user account."
Network Access,Setting up eduroam: Android,"Important notes for devices running Android 11
Beginning with Android version 11, it is no longer possible to choose a ""do not validate"" option in the ""CA certificate"" dropdown. Even trusted CAs (Certificate Authorities) like the RADIUS server certificate, which used to authenticate eduroam, must be validated by your device.
Remove current eduroam configuration
If you have previously set up your eduroam connection without certificate validation, you'll be unable to connect after you've upgraded to Android 11. To reconnect, you'll need to remove the current configuration for eduroam and manually install a Cardinal Key Root CA certificate. To remove any current configuration for eduroam, follow these steps:
Open Settings and then access Wi-Fi options.Tap and hold eduroam. If the option to ""Forget network"" appears, then select it and continue.If the option to ""Forget network"" does not appear, you can still continue with the steps below to manually install a Cardinal Key Root CA certificate.
Android 11: Connect to eduroam (optional for Android 9 and 10)
To connect to eduroam, you must manually install a Cardinal Key Root CA certificate on your device (this is a one-time step). To do this, make sure your device is connected to the internet and follow these steps:
Download the Cardinal Key Root CA certificate (cardinalkey-root.cer) on your device.Follow Google's instructions to add a certificate.Configure the eduroam settings as follows:
When prompted to choose the uses for the certificate(s), select both VPN and apps and Wi-Fi.When prompted to enter a name for the certificate, use Cardinal Key Root."

Network Access,Wireless Access for Stanford Visitors,"The information on this page applies only to the wireless network managed by Stanford University IT. Many schools and departments on campus also provide their own wireless networks.
Every day, Stanford hosts many visitors and guests who need wireless access. They include:
Prospective students and their familiesVendors attending meetings on campusAlumniConference attendees from other educational institutions
Three types of wireless access are available, depending upon who you are:
Stanford Visitor (short-term sessions; limited bandwidth; ports limited to email, web browsing, VPN, and SSH; not part of Stanford University IP space)Sponsored Guest (no restrictions based on ports; available for up to two weeks; requires a Stanford sponsor; part of Stanford University IP space)eduroam (for eduroam affiliates; requires an account at an institution that participates in eduroam)
Stanford Visitor wireless access
With the Stanford Visitor network, you can use the university's wireless network to access the Internet while on-campus. The Stanford Visitor network is intended for the average Stanford visitor — not visitors who need access to special applications.
The visitor network offers limited bandwidth, and sessions are limited to 12 hours. Services are limited to email, web browsing, VPN, and SSH, and visitors on this wireless network are not part of Stanford University IP space— meaning firewalls on campus may give you less access than if you use the Sponsored Guest wireless. 
How to get online
Select the SSID Stanford Visitor from your device's list of available wireless networks.Open a browser and load any URL; you will be redirected to an access page (on a mobile phone, the access page should open automatically).Click Accept to acknowledge the terms of use. Your browser will be sent to a confirmation page, and from there you can get online.
Sponsored Guest wireless access
If you use an application that has a unique set of ports or if you need to be part of the Stanford University IP space, you may want to consider using the Sponsored Guest wireless network.
You will first need a current Stanford faculty member, staff member, or student to sponsor a wireless guest account for you.
To sponsor a guest, visit wirelessguest.stanford.edu to establish a SUNet ID-sponsored guest account. This includes selecting a user name and a password for the guest account.
The length of the sponsorship ranges from one to 14 days. If your guests visit for more than two weeks, they will need a new guest account. University IT tracks guest accounts to the sponsoring SUNet ID.
How to get online

Network Access,Connecting to Stanford’s Wired Network with Windows 10,"Your computer needs a unique Internet address in order for it to work on Stanford's computer network (SUNet). To get a valid Internet address assigned to your computer, you need to configure the TCP/IP protocol and determine your Ethernet hardware address (also known as a MAC address). Then, you must register your Ethernet hardware address for on-campus use in order for your computer to operate on SUNet.
Note: You must be logged on as an administrator or a member of the Administrators group in order to complete this procedure.
Determining your physical hardware address (MAC address)
Method 1: The easiest method for obtaining the MAC address of your Windows computer is using the Command Prompt.

Open the Command Prompt. Search, “Command Prompt” in the taskbar, or if you have an older version of Windows you can right-click on the Start button and select Command Prompt from the menu.


At the C:\ prompt type, ipconfig /all and press enter. This will display your network configuration. 
 

Find your adapter's Physical Address. Scroll down to your network adapter and look for the values next to “Physical Address”. That is your MAC address.​

Method 2: How to find your MAC address in Network Connection Settings.
You can also find the MAC address by looking at the details of your network adapter. 

Search “View network status and tasks” in the taskbar and select it. (Or navigate to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network Sharing Center). 


Click on your network connection. 
Click the Details button. 
Locate the Physical address. The value for the physical address in the Network Connection Details window is your MAC address. ​

Registering your Ethernet address
You will not be able to use your computer on the Stanford network until your hardware MAC address is registered.

​Faculty and staff: Give your hardware address and other configuration information to your Local Network Administrator (LNA).
On-campus students: You must first connect to the wired network or ""Stanford"" wireless network and then register your MAC address online at https://iprequest.stanford.edu. Schwab, Jack McDonald and Highland residents should register their MAC address at http://gsbentreg.stanford.edu.
Off-campus students: Submit a Help request to the Stanford IT Help Desk. Be sure to include your hardware MAC address in the request description.

Graduate students living off-campus who use their computer primarily in a department office should try contacting their LNA first."

Device Security,What is required for devices to meet the computer security mandate?,"All devices covered by the security mandate must be encrypted using the operating system's native encryption facilities. For macOS FileVault 2 is required, and for Windows desktop operating systems BitLocker is required. Mobile iOS and Android devices must be encrypted using their available built-in technologies.
For macOS and Windows devices, Jamf, BigFix or VLRE must be installed in order to verify encryption in an ongoing way that can be centrally audited. Devices that have access to High Risk Data must have Jamf or BigFix installed, and in the case of BigFix must be configured for Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) settings management .
In the case of mobile iOS and Android devices, Stanford's Mobile Device Management service is required for faculty, staff and postdoc devices used on Stanford campus networks.
Generally speaking only the three most recent versions of macOS, Windows, iOS and Android are acceptable, and any older systems, as listed on the Service and Software Sunset Schedule page, will be considered non-compliant.
For devices that are used for highly specialized purposes and cannot be made compliant, an exception request must be approved.
You are strongly encouraged to maintain back-ups of your data for all encrypted devices
See Security Requirements Questions and Answers for more information ."

Use Case
Manage and Secure Apple platforms at Work with Jamf
 
Prefer written instructions? See our step-by-step guide below: 
 

 
What Is Jamf at Stanford?
Jamf is a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution to manage and secure the Apple devices. Jamf  allows us to proactively manage the entire lifecycle of all Apple devices. Lifecycle management for macOS includes deploying and maintaining software, responding to security threats, distributing settings, and analyzing inventory data.
 
-Designed For
• Faculty          • Staff         • Students
 
Requirements:

SUNet ID
Stanford-owned Mac device or personally-owned Mac used for official Stanford work
A supported version of macOS – The policy for minimum software versions at Stanford.

Please note: Stanford purchased devices are enrolled in Jamf automatically and personally owned devices are enrolled in Jamf through a user-initiated workflow.
 Enrolling in Jamf is almost automatic — the process requires just a few simple manual steps on your end.  Here's how the Jamf enrollment works.
Install Jamf on your Mac
Download Jamf Enrollment app From the UIT Website.
 https://uit.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/installers/jamf/mac/Jamf-Enrollment-1.2.zip

5. To begin the installation, click Open Profiles and then click Install in the top right of the Profiles pane. To confirm the installation, click Install.
 

 
6. You're finished! Click Close."
Device Security,Back Up Your Encryption Recovery Key (Mac),"If your computer is encrypted and you forget the password that unlocks your hard drive, you'll need the encryption recovery key to unlock your drive. In most cases, Stanford users have their recovery keys backed up in a secure database by the university. The recovery key  can then be retrieved in MyDevices.
Due to a bug that has now been fixed, some recovery keys that were saved using the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) service cannot be retrieved in MyDevices. You can check to see if any device belonging to you has a key available for retrieval in MyDevices.
If your device is encrypted but your encryption recovery key cannot be retrieved in MyDevices, you can use the Key Escrow Tool to fix the problem. 
Get the Key Escrow Tool
There are two ways to get the tool: you can download it on demand or it may deployed automatically to your computer via BigFix.
Method #1 — Download the Key Escrow Tool installer
You can download and run the installer yourself.

Download and run the Key Escrow Tool installer

Method #2 — Deployed automatically via BigFix
If you need to run the Key Escrow Tool, it will be delivered to your computer via BigFix. You will be notified in advance that this is going to happen.

When the tool is deployed to your computer you will see an alert in the upper-right corner of your screen. You must click one of the buttons to continue.

Click Start to continue to download and run the Key Escrow Tool.
Click Defer to defer the deployment for 24 hours.

 
If you clicked Start, another screen displays. Click OK .If you click Defer the program will launch again in one day. If you click Cancel the program will not automatically launch again. 

Install the tool
Note: If you are running a  version of macOS prior to 10.9.5 the installation process will be slightly different. See the Missing Encryption Recovery Keys FAQ for more information.

Regardless of whether the installer is launched via BigFix or on demand, the Welcome screen displays. Click Continue.
Select your hard drive as the disk where you want to install the software and then click Continue
Click Install to begin the installation.
When prompted, enter your local administrator account name and password for the Mac and click Install Software.Note: If you are prompted for a password that you don't know, please contact your local IT support, submit a Help ticket or call the IT Service Desk at (650) 725-HELP (5-4357).
Click Yes, Escrow My Recovery Key to save your encryption recovery key in a secure database.If your recovery key is already saved, you will have the option to generate and save a new one.​
At the prompt, enter your local computer password for the Mac and then click Unlock.
Your encryption recovery key displays. Write this down and store it in a secure location if you wish and then click Close.
After the installation has completed, click Close to exit the setup wizard.
To verify that your device's key has successfully been escrowed,  check its Device Details page in MyDevices. Note that there can be a delay of up to eight hours between the time you run the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool and the time the key can be retrieved in MyDevices."
Device Security,What should I do if my operating system doesn't support encryption?,You should upgrade to an operating system that supports BitLocker or FileVault 2 encryption. See Encrypt Your Devices for more information. Submit a Help ticket for assistance.
Device Security,Stanford Mobile Device Management (MDM) Configuration Profiles (iOS/iPadOS),"MDM (Mobile Device Management) applies a profile that can:

Add a passcode or password to your device.
Remotely lock your device if you lose it — a benefit from using a passcode/password with your device.
Enable you to wipe data from your device if it's lost or stolen.
Configure Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
Configure email, contacts, and calendar to your device.
Detect whether a device has been jailbroken or rooted.
Automatically block intruders who enter more than 10 failed passcode/password attempts. (Note: reaching the 10th attempt takes two hours.)

Mail
Why use MDM (managed) email?
You might already have Stanford email, calendar, and contact information on your device. If you replace your existing accounts with the managed account provided by MDM, you can benefit in these ways:

Easy removal: The managed account can be removed remotely if your device is lost or stolen, or if you leave Stanford. In contrast, a manually configured account can't be removed without wiping the entire device.
Better battery life: Managed email and calendar settings are optimized by reducing the number of hits to the server, thus putting less drain on your device's battery.

Duplicate accounts
If you already have Stanford Email and Calendar on your device when you enroll in the MDM program — but you want to install managed mail — delete your old account before you add the managed account to avoid duplicate emails and appointments. Deleting your account will not delete your messages and appointments from the server. They will be safely reinstalled through the MDM enrollment process.
To delete an account on your iOS device:

Tap Settings > Mail, Contacts, Calendar.
From the list of accounts, tap the one you want to delete.
Tap Delete Account (the red button) at the bottom of the page.You will see a prompt that says ""Deleting this account will remove its data from your iPhone/iPad.""
Tap Delete Account.

To delete an account on your Android device:
Note: Each Adroid device may be slightly different.

Tap Settings > Email.
Tap Manage Accounts.
Press and hold the name of your Stanford email account — typically Exchange or ActiveSync for Stanford accounts.
Tap Remove.

What to expect — installing MDM mail
When you include MDM mail during your enrollment, you'll see a lot of activity for a few minutes on your device. All your messages need to download and your appointments need to sync to your calendar. This is normal. In a few minutes, you'll have your messages and appointments on your device.
Passcode/password lock
The MDM sets up your device to require a passcode or password after a certain period of inactivity (Auto-Lock), or for a ""grace period"" after you press the On/Off button on the device. It enables these settings with a maximum amount of time allowed for each of these functions.
When you install the MDM, the factory default settings are activated. MDM permits you to increase these values up to the maximum defined in the table below. Change the settings here:

Auto-Lock (for inactivity) — iOS: Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock ; Android: Settings > Security >Lock screen (varies slightly from phone to phone)
Require Passcode (for grace period after lock) — iOS: Settings > Touch ID & Passcode > Require Passcode; Android: Settings > Security > Lock screen  > Screen lock




Feature
Default setting
MDM maximum time allowed




Auto-Lock
iPhone: 1 minuteiPad: 2 minutesAndroid: varies by model, OS, and carrier

Require Passcode or Password
immediately
5 minutes



Passcode expiration
MDM sets a passcode expiration policy of two years. If you set a passcode prior to enrolling in MDM, the expiration occurs when the passcode age reaches the two year mark — not two years after enrolling in MDM. The new passcode cannot be the same as the old passcode.
Your personal settings and other profiles
If you already have configuration profiles or personal settings on your device that might cause conflict with the MDM, your results may be as follows:
Passcode length: if your passcode is longer than the length by Stanford MDM, your longer passcode will be retained after you enroll in MDM.
Auto-lock: MDM allows Auto-Lock settings up to 5 minutes. If your device is set to Never, or to < 5 minutes before you enroll in MDM, your results may vary. If possible, turn off your existing Auto-Lock and Passcode Lock settings before you install MDM. After you enroll, you can choose Auto-Lock settings of up to 5 minutes and your Passcode Lock will be set to 1 minute, which you can reset to Immediately if you prefer."
Device Security,Device Enrollment: Enroll a Mac,"The Device Enrollment app presents you with a brief questionnaire. Stanford needs to gather some information about  your computer to ensure it meets security standards.  Enrollment also associates a computer with the person who is responsible for its data security in MyDevices.

Device Security,Why is my device reported to be unencrypted when I'm sure it's encrypted?,"BigFix might not be checking in, or only partially checking in.
Go to mydevices.stanford.edu  and then click the link in the Model column to display the Device Details page of the non-compliant device. In the Device Information section, under Encryption Status,  the ""Last checked"" date might be too far in the past.  The difference between the ""Last checked"" date and the  ""Last Seen on Network"" date in the Miscellaneous Information section should be no more than 7 days."
Device Security,What can an IT professional do if a user's device is reported to be partially encrypted?,"If a device has multiple fixed disks, all of them are required to be encrypted; and if at least one is, while one or more is not, the device might be reported to be partially encrypted.
Mac OS devices in BigFix that have multiple unencrypted disks are reported to be partially encrypted, and at some point in the future the same will hold for Windows devices as well. Administrators can access BigFix web reports that list all such devices (that have BigFix installed on them) in their areas: ""[STANFORD] Mac OS Multiple Unencrypted Disks"" and ""[STANFORD] Windows Multiple Unencrypted Disks"".
IMPORTANT: Currently we can only escrow recovery keys for the system volume.

Device Security,Mobile Device Management (MDM) Privacy Information,"Workspace ONE (Android) and Jamf (iOS/iPadOS) mobile device management (MDM) enforce and periodically report on your device's configuration to ensure alignment with the Minimum Security Standards.
Stanford University respects your privacy, and MDM cannot access your application data, call history, voicemail, or SMS messages on your mobile device. We cannot and do not collect your personal data, and while the capability exists, we do not collect GPS location information. Here's what information we collect and why:

Device and network ID, and information on storage capacity, operating system, carrier, and firmware (to uniquely identify your device in MyDevices and to ensure that we're looking at the correct records if it’s lost or stolen).
List of apps installed by MDM, not including your personal apps (needed by MDM to confirm whether apps provided by Stanford have been installed). MDM can list all installed apps, but we have explicitly disabled that capability.
Jailbreak or root detection (indicates whether built-in security features have been bypassed. Jailbreak or root detection informs you if these features have been disabled).

Here's what permissions are requested and why:

Add/remove accounts (to set up Stanford Email and Calendar, if you opt-in).
Add/remove restrictions (to establish minimum security standards, such as requiring a device passcode and auto screen lock).
Remotely erase Stanford data (if you leave the University or lose your device). The capability exists to wipe your phone fully, but the university will never do this on your behalf.

The collected data is considered Moderate Risk data in the University's risk classification system.

We also store the time of enrollment in the service and the time of each access to the service by your mobile device."
Device Security,What are the information security requirements for removable media?,"At this time, removable storage devices (e.g., USB hard drives, USB flash memory) are exempt from encryption requirements. Nonetheless, if a device is being used to store (e.g., to back up) High Risk Data, every effort should be made to encrypt it, and to keep it physically secure."
Device Security,What happens if a device is not compliant with the security requirements?,"If you have a non-compliant device, you are notified via email that you must take action. The email specifies the steps you need to take to make the device compliant and you have a 30-day grace period to take action. You'll receive weekly reminders listing the non-compliant device and the remaining grace period days. If after 30 days from receipt of the first notification a device is still non-compliant, it is blocked from accessing the Stanford network till it is made compliant.

Device Security,How to Install Stanford Whole Disk Encryption for Mac,"Overview
When you run the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) installer, the first step is Stanford's Device Enrollment app, a brief questionnaire that gathers basic information about your computer. If you already have responded to these questions, your previous answers are displayed.
After you complete the questionnaire, SWDE steps you through the process of encrypting your hard drive. The installer checks your computer to make sure certain requirements are met, such as having BigFix software installed. You will need to fix, or let the installer fix, any items that are flagged before continuing.
Once your computer has been authorized to install encryption, you are prompted to enable FileVault 2, Apple's built-in encryption technology, to encrypt the whole disk.
Notes:
Mac OS X 10.9 and above provide an interface to manage FileVault 2 that allows for the automation of storing recovery information for the encrypted drive.For machines running  OS X 10.7 and 10.8, you'll need to manually turn on FileVault and run a tool to escrow your recovery key. See the manual activation instructions for assistance with the process.Boot Camp: FileVault 2 does not encrypt the Windows partition on systems running Boot Camp. Therefore, SWDE-compliant machines cannot run Boot Camp.  OS X users needing to run Windows need to use VMware Fusion or Parallels.
Download software
System requirements
Operating System: Mac OS X 10.9 and above is required.

You are strongly encouraged to back up your files before starting to encrypt.

Device Security,How to Resolve the AMIE Email Verification Loop,"Issue
When completing the initial Data and Device Attestation, new users may get stuck in an email verification loop. Users will receive the email with the verification code and link but will be unable to open the link and continue. Instead, clicking the link will prompt the user to generate the link again and will not provide a place to enter the verification code.
Resolution
The issue is resolved by opening the link in either a different browser or a private/incognito window. The issue will also resolve itself if enough time has passed that the user needs to sign into AMIE again.
Note
It has been found that this workaround did not work on a Linux system on eduroam, but the issue was resolved when the same machine was connected to a different network."
Device Security,What are the ways to update a user's Device Enrollment answers?,"The user can manually run the Device Enrollment app to update existing answers. 
If BigFix is installed, you can delete the enrollment.txt file on the endpoint system to force re-enrollment. The file locations are:

Windows 7 and above: \ProgramData\Stanford\enrollment.txtMac OS: /Library/Application Support/Stanford/enrollment.txt


A BigFix administrator can use the ""[STANFORD][SWDE] Delete Enrollment Answers"" fixlet, which can selectively delete existing user enrollment answers on both Windows and Mac OS devices. Non-expiring actions targeting all Stanford BigFix clients will then prompt users to enroll or re-enroll, until someone self-identifies as the primary user.

The fixlet provides three possible actions:


Delete primary user enrollment answers only. Each new local user who has not previously provided any enrollment answers will be prompted to enroll. Answers from non-primary users will be preserved, and those users will not be prompted to re-enroll.
Delete all user enrollment answers. All local users will be prompted to enroll or re-enroll at their next logon. Use this action if existing non-primary users might need to be promoted to primary, or to start from scratch for any reason.
Delete enrollment answers for a specific SUNet ID. Enrollment answers for the specified SUNet ID will be deleted whether or not that user is identified as primary. If this action deletes a primary user, new local users will be prompted to enroll until a new primary user self-identifies.

A copy of the existing enrollment.txt file will be saved before modification or deletion."
Device Security,Why is my device reported to be partially encrypted?,"If a device has multiple fixed disks, all of them are required to be encrypted. If at least one is encrypted, while one or more is not, the device might be reported to be partially encrypted."
Device Security,Why is my encrypted Mac reporting that it is not encrypted in MyDevices?,"There are three likely reasons that an encrypted Mac would indicate that it is unencrypted in My Devices:
The system was encrypted but has not been rebooted since the encryption was completed. If you suspect this may be the case, reboot before proceeding. FileVault has been enabled but encryption is not yet complete. On large traditional hard drives the time to complete encryption can run many hours, increasing with the size of the drive. Also, encryption of APFS-formatted SSD drives takes longer than encryption on HFS+-formatted SSD drives. FileVault is on and the boot volume is encrypted but additional volumes have been created that are not encrypted.
How to determine if your Mac is encrypted: hard drives with one partition/volume
To confirm the encryption status of your Mac, navigate to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault.
If your hard drive is encrypted, the FileVault displays a message saying that FileVault is turned on. If your had drive is not encrypted, the FileVault screen displays a message saying that FileVault is turned off. If your hard drive is in the process of being encrypted, the FileVault screen displays the encryption status.
How to determine if your Mac is encrypted: hard drives with multiple partitions/volumes
Navigating to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault reveals the status of the system partition but not any additional partitions. To find the status of additional partitions or volumes:
Navigate to Applications > Utilities and launch Disk Utility app.In the left panel, click the extra partition or volume and then click Info in the upper-right corner of the toolbar.Information about the selected volume displays. Find the Is encrypted line and confirm that is says Yes. You may have to expand the window to display all the information.Check the encryption status for each additional partition or volume.If the encryption status of any volume or partition is No, launch Finder. In the dock, click the Finder icon and then in the left panel under Devices, click your computer name.In the right panel, CONTROL + click the icon of the additional partition or volume. Find the menu item labeled Encrypt <volume name> where <volume name> is the name of the partition or volume. This will encrypt the partition.When the encryption is completed, the Encrypt menu item changes to Decrypt <volume name>.
Get encryption status using command line tools
Get encryption status for system partition
To get the system partition status launch Terminal.app and run the following command:
/usr/bin/fdesetup status
If the system partition is encrypted the status returned is: FileVault is OnIf the system partition is not encrypted the status returned is: FileVault is OffIf the system partition is currently being encrypted the status returned is: FileVault is On. Encryption in progress: Percent completed = XX
Get encryption status for additional partitions or volumes
To get encryption status for additional partitions/volumes launch Terminal.app and run the following command:
/usr/sbin/diskutil list
 Run the following command to get the encryption status of a particular volume. (In this example the volume is named ""Test."")
 /usr/sbin/diskutil cs info /Volumes/Test
Note: This command returns a list of core storage properties, which includes encryption status.

If ""Test"" is encrypted, the core storage properties show Conversion State: Complete and LV Conversion Progress: 100%. If ""Test"" is not encrypted, the core storage properties return a message saying that ""Test"" is not a CoreStorage disk. If ""Test"" is in the process of being encrypted the core storage properties show Conversion State: Converting and LV Conversion Progress: the percent of encryption completed.

Answers to frequently asked questions
What is the problem?
Some encryption recovery keys for macOS and Windows computers that were backed up using the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption service are not available for retrieval in MyDevices, although they should be. Correcting the problem will in many cases require action on the part of affected users.
What is an encryption recovery key and why is it important?
If you're ever locked out of an encrypted macOS or Windows computer, e.g., because you've forgotten the necessary password, you will need an encryption recovery key to unlock it. In most cases, Stanford users should have their keys securely backed up by University IT (also known as ""key escrow""), so that they can be retrieved in MyDevices.
Note that VLRE users, during installation of the VLRE software, can choose not to escrow their recovery keys, although it's strongly recommended that they do so.
Who is affected by the missing recovery key problem?
Anyone who encrypted a macOS or Windows computer using Stanford-provided software (i.e., SWDE or VLRE) could find that the encryption recovery key for that computer isn't retrievable in MyDevices. Mobile devices are not affected.
Will device compliance be affected by this problem?
No. It is not required that a device's encryption recovery key be backed up in MyDevices for the device to be compliant.
What should I do to correct this problem?
You can first check to see if any device belonging to you does not have a key available for retrieval in MyDevices. If you find a device for which a key should be available but is not, you can fix the problem by downloading and running the Key Escrow Tool for Mac or the Key Escrow Tool for Windows. The tool must be run on each device whose key is missing.
In some cases you might see an alert that will appear on your affected macOS devices' desktops requesting that you run the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool. The tool would then be delivered automatically using BigFix. BigFix is required for devices subject to Stanford's compliance rules, if those devices are not using VLRE.

You can verify that a device's key has successfully been escrowed by checking its Device Details page in MyDevices, bearing in mind that there will be a delay of up to 8 hours between the time you run the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool and the time the key can be retrieved in MyDevices.
How can I tell if a device's recovery key is in MyDevices?
You can tell whether a particular device has a recovery key available for retrieval by looking in MyDevices. For each device, check the Device Details page by clicking the Model name. The Encryption Status line will state ""Encryption key not available for the device"" if there's no key in escrow, and otherwise you'll see a link to retrieve the key.

Users who have one or more devices with missing recovery keys will also see an announcement on their MyDevices main page listing the names of the affected devices. Clicking on a device name will bring up its Details page.

Will affected users be notified?
Yes. Starting on April 20, 2017 there will be an announcement displayed on the MyDevices main page for affected users, which will list each device for which a key is missing. There will be broad outreach to the university's technical support community. Eventually affected users who have not already taken action may be notified directly by e-mail.
What caused the missing recovery key problem in MyDevices?
A bug in the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) desktop application for macOS and Windows, which was fixed in December 2016, was sometimes causing recovery keys not to be stored in MyDevices.
The problem at first was only apparent when someone tried to retrieve a key. Now there's a clear indication in MyDevices that a given device's recovery key is or is not available for retrieval.
What is key escrow?
Key escrow is secure storage by Stanford University IT of encryption recovery keys for specific devices, so that they may be retrieved from MyDevices when needed. Only the person whose device's key is in escrow can retrieve the key, absent extraordinary circumstances. Recovery keys are stored in encrypted form.
What happens if I use VLRE and choose not to escrow a key?
You will need to save your encryption recovery key by some other means, such as writing it down on a piece of paper that's stored in a secure location that's reliably accessible to you. You can also escrow keys with other services, such as that provided by Apple for macOS devices.
What if I'm running a version of macOS prior to 10.9.5?
For versions of macOS prior to 10.9.5, you will either have to enter the device's existing recovery key manually in the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool, assuming you have the key, or else you'll have to decrypt and re-encrypt the device using SWDE. The software will guide you through the process.
What if I'm prompted for a password I don't have?
If the Encryption Recovery Key Escrow Tool prompts you for an administrator password that you don't have, you will probably need to get assistance from your local technical support group.
What if MyDevices shows there's a missing key, but the Key Escrow Tool shows there's not?
In some cases MyDevices might report that a device's encryption recovery key is missing, but when you run the Key Escrow Tool on that device, the tool will report that the key is already backed up. In this situation the information in MyDevices may be incorrect, so if possible you should wait a day and look in MyDevices once again.
If the key still appears to be missing, you can use the Key Escrow Tool to create a new recovery key. If you create a new key, it should appear in MyDevices within 12 hours. If you need help, please contact IT support.
What if I need help?
If you need further assistance, please contact your local IT support, submit a Help ticket, or call 725-HELP (5-4357)."
Device Security,How to Encrypt Disk Partitions on macOS,"In order for devices to be fully compliant—as defined in the Information Security Office (ISO) standards—all internal partitions must be encrypted. The initial SWDE (Stanford Whole Disk Encryption) enrollment procedure only encrypts the “system” partition in multi-partition Macs. All internal, non-system partitions are encrypted manually from within Finder.

Launch Finder and select the non-system partition. Right-click (or CTRL + click) the partition name and select Encrypt <partition name>.
Create an encryption password. This can be any password you choose but don’t forget it. It will be required the next time you login to the Mac. Then, click Encrypt Disk.
When encryption is complete the menu item will change to Decrypt <partition name>.
The next time you reboot your Mac or log in you will be prompted to enter your encryption password to unlock the encrypted volume. This happens every reboot or login unless the password is saved in the keychain."
Device Security,How to Install VLRE for Mac,"On this page:
Download VLREEnrollEncrypt with VLRESelf EncryptionUpdate NoticeHelp
When you run the VLRE installer, you are presented with Stanford's Device Enrollment app, a brief questionnaire that gathers basic information about your computer. If you previously responded to these questions, your answers are displayed and you can change them if you wish.
After you complete the questionnaire:
If your computer was encrypted using the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption service (SWDE) no further action is required.If your computer is not encrypted, VLRE steps you through the process of encrypting your hard drive. You are prompted to enable FileVault 2, Apple's built-in encryption technology, to encrypt the whole disk.If you self-encrypted your computer by turning on FileVault 2,  you are presented with an option to have your recovery key escrowed in a secure database. This option is highly recommended because it allows you to use the MyDevices service to recover your encryption key. If you forget your password you need your recovery key to access your computer. If you don't have your recovery key, your data is permanently lost.

Device enrollment questionnaire
Run the VLRE  installer.When the Install VLRE screen displays, click Continue. A setup wizard guides you through the steps necessary to install the software.First, the Device Enrollment app runs, asking a series of questions regarding the use of this computer for Stanford business. If you have already answered these questions, please review the answers and make any necessary corrections. Click Proceed Now.Next, choose whether or not you have a valid SUNet ID and then click Continue.If you have a valid SUNet ID:
Enter your SUNet ID and password on the Login screen.​You will be asked to answer some questions about this device and the types of data that is accessed and stored on it.
If you do not have a valid SUNet ID:
If you are no longer affiliated with Stanford, the questionnaire is terminated.If  this computer is used for Stanford work, the questionnaire is terminated. Someone with a valid SUNet ID needs to complete the questionnaire.

Encrypt with VLRE
If you need to encrypt your computer, VLRE steps you through the encryption process after the questionnaire is completed.
Before you begin
Note: You are encouraged to contact your local support organization to make sure your system is being routinely backed up prior to encrypting.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you back up your computer or data before you start encrypting. If the disk encryption process encounters a disk error, data loss or corruption could occur. CrashPlan provided by University IT is the recommended backup service and is widely used within Stanford, but your local IT group may provide other options.

Before starting the encryption, make sure your computer is on AC power and has an active network connection.Depending on the size and speed of your hard drive and how many files are stored there, encryption can take from 45 minutes to two days. You may want to install the the software at the end of the day and let the encryption run over night. You can use your computer during the encryption process, but certain activities may be noticeably slower.Note regarding Boot Camp: FileVault 2 does not encrypt the Windows partition on systems running Boot Camp.  Therefore,  to be compliant machines cannot run Boot Camp.  OS X users needing to run Windows need to use VMware Fusion or Parallels.
VLRE can log the program activity to a local file that technical support staff can use for troubleshooting. Click Yes to enable logging (recommended) or No to not enable logging.
Click OK to begin whole disk encryption.
Encrypt
You  are given the option to escrow your encryption recovery key in a secure database. Selecting Yes is highly recommended because it allows you to use the MyDevices service to recover your encryption key. Click Next to continue.The next screen describes what to expect. If you are ready to encrypt your hard drive, check I have a backup and understand the risks involved and wish to continue and then click Continue. (If your computer is already encrypted this screen does not display.)When the Welcome screen is displayed, click Continue.Next, a policy agreement is displayed. Read it and click Agree to accept the terms of the policy agreement and continue with the installation.Click Configure to enable FielVault2.If your are running macOS 10.12 and below, you will see a message saying that you need to restart your computer after FileVault2 is installed. Click Yes.Enter your administrator account name and password and then click Unlock.Your recovery key is displayed. You will need this to unlock your FileVault 2 encryption if you forget your computer password. Make a copy of the recovery key and store it in a safe place. Then, click Close.macOS 10.13 and above users: Click OK to start encrypting.macOS 10.12 and below users: You need to restart your computer and complete the FileVault2 configuration.After your computer restarts, enter your account password.A window displays the encryption status.Note: You can use your computer while it is being encrypted.
Self encryption
If you encrypted your computer using FileVault 2 without using Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE), you are responsible for managing the recovery key.
After completing the questionnaire you are presented with an option to have the recovery key escrowed in a secure database. This option is highly recommended because if you lose or forget your recovery key, your encrypted data will be irretrievable.
If you opt to have your recovery key escrowed:
Mac OS X 10.9.5 and above: a new recovery key is generated and then escrowed.Below Mac OS X 10.9.5: a dialog box prompts you to enter your recovery key.
Update notice
A message will pop up on your computer screen when a new version of VLRE is available. You should install the latest version of VLRE to maintain device compliance.

Device Security,Who should be listed as the primary user during device enrollment?,"The primary user is the person responsible for a device's security and maintenance. In many cases this is unambiguously the person who is the sole user of a device, but sometimes it will be a system administrator, or one user in a collection of occasional users.
It is necessary to specify a primary user's SUNet ID during device enrollment in order for a device to be associated with that user in MyDevices. A Mac OS or Windows device can have any number of secondary users, whose enrollment answers are saved, but ignored for compliance purposes."
Device Security,Rooting Information for Android Devices,"What is rooting?
Rooting is the process of gaining privileged access, known as root access, to your device's operating system. With root access you are able to use device features that may be locked or disabled, add custom themes and settings, and replace the operating system with another version.
Why does it matter if a phone is rooted?
Rooting is often performed with the goal of overcoming limitations that carriers and hardware manufacturers put on some devices. However, there are many downsides to rooting a device:

Almost all manufacturers' warranties become void once you root your device.
If the process is not done correctly, your device could become permanently unusable.
Malware can have direct access to the device's operating system, bypassing all the safety measures that are in place.
Firmware and software updates from your wireless carrier may not be able to be installed.

Some of you work with data that Stanford categorizes as Moderate or High Risk. If you work with High Risk Data, you must use a device that offers hardware encryption, that has not been rooted, and that employs the security settings and features that can be automatically configured for you by MDM.
Root detection
Stanford can determine through its network services whether or not your device was rooted. MDM notifies you of this status because:

You must unroot your device to remain in compliance with the requirements of Stanford MDM.
You might not know that the data on your device is at risk — for example, your banking apps, your Facebook account, and anything else that requires a secure login.

How to unroot your device
There is no clear recommendation on what to do once a device is rooted because unrooting varies by device. For some devices, restoring your device to the factory settings is effective. However, this resets all settings and deletes all data on your device. We recommend contacting the person who rooted your device regarding the process for unrooting it. You could also search the web for unrooting instructions for your device.
Even if you are able to successfully “unroot” your device, many Android device vendors embed a feature that will forever indicate a device is rooted my MDM systems such as AirWatch. Be aware of this when making the decision to root your device.
Rooted devices cannot comply with the requirements for Stanford University Mobile Device Management. If you need assistance unenrolling your device in MDM, please submit a Help ticket."
Device Security,Jailbreaking Information for iOS Devices,"What is jailbreaking?
Jailbreaking unlocks the security settings on your device so that you have admin control over it. After it's jailbroken, others could potentially have admin control over it, too. On an Android device, this same process is called ""rooting.""
Sometimes people jailbreak their devices intentionally — for example, to change the SIM card when they travel abroad, or to use the device with a different carrier. Other times they might not know their device is jailbroken — they might have visited a website or downloaded a document that altered the device's settings.
Why does it matter if a phone is jailbroken?
When an iOS device is jailbroken, its built-in security features are compromised. For example, by design, iOS ""sandboxes"" its applications so that data from one app can't be read or altered by another one. When you jailbreak your phone, you're vulnerable to hackers who could steal your passwords and data, or install malware on your device.
In addition, you won't receive software updates and security patches if your device is jailbroken.
Some of you work with data that Stanford categorizes as Moderate or High Risk. If you work with High Risk Data, you must use a device that offers hardware encryption, that has not been jailbroken, and that employs the security settings and features that can be automatically configured for you by MDM.
Jailbreak detection
Stanford can determine through its network services whether or not your device was jailbroken. MDM notifies you of this status because:

You may need to un-jailbreak your phone to remain in compliance with the requirements of your job.
You might not know that the data on your device is at risk — for example, your banking apps, your Facebook account, and anything else that requires a secure login.

How to un-jailbreak your device

Connect your iOS device to iTunes.
In the left sidebar in iTunes, select your device.
Click the Summary tab in the main window, then click the Restore button.
Click Back Up when you see a pop-up message that asks if you want to back up your device, then click Restore again. Your device will first be returned to factory default settings before restoring it.
Wait while iTunes goes through the backup process and until you see the iPhone is activated message.
Click Restore from Backup...to restore your apps, music, and data back onto the phone. Any jailbroken apps won't be transferred back to the device."
Device Security,Why are devices that don't belong to me showing up in MyDevices?,"If a device that once belonged to you is being used by someone else at Stanford, it will continue to appear in your MyDevices until the new user runs the Enrollment Application to change the primary user SUNet ID.
You can remove the device from your MyDevices record by going to mydevices.stanford.edu and clicking the Remove button associated with the device."
Device Security,Mobile Device Compliance Checks in MyDevices,"Your device needs to check in regularly to ensure that appropriate security controls are in place. You can see when your device last checked in to Stanford MDM in the Management System Information section of the Device Details page for your device.
A device that hasn't checked in for a while might:

Be turned off or inoperable.
Be lost or stolen.
Have uninstalled the AirWatch app.
Have forced the AirWatch app to quit.

If your device has not checked in for over two weeks and is in your possession, turn the device on and open the AirWatch app. Tap on your device in the Status section and tap the Send Data button. If you've lost your device, see the Manage Your Lost Device page for more information.
iOS compliance checks
iOS — Has your device reported that it is not jailbroken?
The MDM service checks your device to make sure it isn't jailbroken. Jailbreaking compromises its built-in security features.
If your device has been jailbroken, you can fix it by following the ""How to Un-Jailbreak Your Phone"" instructions on the Jailbreaking Information page.
iOS — Are you running iOS 9.3.5 or higher?
Older versions of iOS have known vulnerabilities.
You should run the current version of iOS on your device to get the full benefit of security features and software patches.
iOS — is the AirWatch app installed?
If you don't have this app installed, please download it again from iTunes or the App Store. Launch the app, tap your device, and then tap the Send Data button to update your status.
The app must remain running in the background. It remains inactive save for sending a signal once a day to update your check-in status. Please do not force the app to quit.
Android compliance checks
Android — has your device reported that it has not been rooted?
The MDM service checks your device to make sure it isn't rooted. Rooting compromises its built-in security features. If you need assistance with unrooting your device, please submit a Help ticket. 
Android — is your device encrypted?
Your device must be encrypted. If it has not yet been encrypted, you will see a red alert.
To encrypt your device, it must have a password with a minimum of four digits, be plugged in, and be charged to 80%. Once you begin the encryption process, it may take up to two hours. Your phone must remain plugged in and will not receive phone calls or text messages during this period. It may also get hot. We recommend beginning the encryption process at bedtime. 
Android — does your device have a password?
Stanford University requires that you have a minimum of a four-character password. Face Unlock and Pattern security are not allowed. Some devices may have a stronger password requirement. 
To set a password, go to Settings > Security > Screen lock."
Device Security,Why aren't the changes I made reflected in MyDevices?,"MyDevices is only periodically updated throughout the day, and once updated, in some cases there has to be additional processing, which can take time. If a change isn't reflected after 24 hours for a device that's currently on the network, submit a Help ticket for assistance."
Device Security,What should I do if I remove a device from MyDevices by mistake?,"If you accidentally remove a device, please submit a Help ticket to have the device reinstated."
Device Security,What should an IT professional do if a user's changes are not reflected in MyDevices?,"If an end-user makes a change that isn't reflected in MyDevices after 24 hours for a device that's currently on the network, an IT professional can make changes to the NetDB node record:

Delete the existing node record, rather than editing it.
Wait for up to two hours to give the Device Registry time to receive notice of the deletion.
Create a new node record for the device.

If you don't follow this procedure, you might not get the results you want."
Device Security,What should I do if I see multiple entries for the same device in MyDevices?,"If you see multiple entries for the same device, please submit a Help ticket."
Device Security,What are the technical reasons why a device that doesn't belong to a user might show up in MyDevices?,"In some cases a device that once belonged to a user could appear in MyDevices if the SUNet ID is listed as a user in NetDB. The solution will be for an LNA to edit the NetDB record manually.
A less common but very confusing problem can arise if a network interface is passed around among different devices, as can happen with USB Ethernet adapters, laptop docking stations, some computer displays, and so on. In such a case these adapters are functioning like other network devices (e.g., a Wi-Fi router or Ethernet switch), and should be registered in NetDB as network devices with their own node record specifying an appropriate make and model. If devices like these are used solely with one computer, they should be registered as an interface of that computer."

Device Security,BitLocker Overview,"University IT recommends that you enable BitLocker with assistance from an IT support professional.

On this page:
overviewrequirementsenable BitLockerlog inchange PIN or print recovery keyturn off BitLocker

Overview
BitLocker Drive Encryption is a native security feature that encrypts everything on the drive that Windows is installed on. Device encryption helps protect your data by encrypting it. Only someone with the right encryption key (such as a personal identification number) can decrypt it.
BitLocker is used in conjunction with a hardware component called a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM is a smartcard-like module on the motherboard that is installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturer. BitLocker stores its recovery key in the TPM (version 1.2 or higher).
When you enable BitLocker, you create a personal identification number (PIN) that will be required to enter each time you start up your computer. While enabling BitLocker, a recovery key is generated. The recovery key is used to gain access to your computer should you forget your password. After the recovery key is generated you will be prompted to restart the machine. The encryption process begins when the computer reboots.
Note: You should print or save the recovery key and store it in a safe place apart from your computer.
Requirements
To use BitLocker, your computer must satisfy certain requirements:
Supported operating systems:
Windows 10 — Education, Pro, or Enterprise editionWindows 8 — Professional or Enterprise editionWindows 7 — Enterprise or Ultimate edition
For Windows 7, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or higher must be installed. It must also be enabled and activated (or turned on).
Additional requirements:
You must be logged in as an administrator.You must have access to a printer to print the recovery key.
Check your version of Windows
To find out the version of Windows you are running:
Click the Start button.In the Search box, type 'about your PC' winver.If the version displayed is not one of the versions listed above, BitLocker is not available on your computer.
Check your TPM status
If the TPM does not meet the system requirements listed above, the Encryption installer displays the TPM status at the point where you choose your encryption options.
Example of TPM status message::
Contact your local IT support if you want to enable BitLocker but need assistance with enabling and activating the TPM.
Enabling BitLocker
If your computer meets the Windows version and TPM requirements, the process for enabling BitLocker is as follows:
Click Start , click Control Panel, click System and Security (if the control panel items are listed by category), and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.Click Turn on BitLocker.BitLocker scans your computer to verify that it meets the system requirements.
If your computer meets the system requirements, the setup wizard continues with the BitLocker Startup Preferences in step 8.If preparations need to be made to your computer to turn on BitLocker, they are displayed. Click Next.
If prompted to do so, remove any CDs, DVDs, and USB flash drives from your computer and then click Shutdown.Turn your computer back on after shutdown. Follow the instructions in the message to continue initializing the TMP. (The message varies, depending on the computer manufacturer).If your computer shuts down again, turn it back on.The BitLocker setup wizard resumes atomically. Click Next.When the BitLocker startup preferences page is displayed, click Require a PIN at every startup.Enter a PIN from 8 to 20 characters long and then enter it again in the Confirm PIN field. Click Set PIN.Note: You will need to enter your PIN each time you start your computer.To store your recovery key, select Print the recovery key and then click Next.Note: Make sure your computer is connected to a printer.Print a copy of your recovery key.You will be prompted to restart your computer to start the encryption process. You can use your computer while your drive is being encrypted.
Logging in
Enabling BitLocker will change the way you log in to your system. You need to enter your PIN at every startup, prior to entering your password. This is designed to provide an additional layer of security for your data.
Changing your PIN or regenerating a copy of your recovery key
Once you have created your PIN, you can change it in the BitLocker Drive Encryption control panel You can also regenerate a new copy of your recovery key if you lose the printed copy.
Click Start , click Control Panel, click System and Security (if the control panel items are listed by category), and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.In the BitLocker Drive Encryption control panel, click Manage BitLocker.Follow the instructions on the screen.
Turning off BitLocker
If you want to decrypt your hard drive, all you need to do is turn off BitLocker. To turn off BitLocker you must be logged in as an administrator.
Click Start , click Control Panel, click System and Security (if the control panel items are listed by category), and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption.In the BitLocker Drive Encryption control panel, click Turn Off BitLocker.Click Decrypt Drive to start the decryption process."
Device Security,What should I do if I don't see one of my devices in MyDevices?,"Check your network settings to make sure the device is on the network. If it is and you still don't see it in MyDevices, submit a Help ticket."
Device Security,Why is a user's Chromebook not being correctly identified in MyDevices?,"A network administrator can edit the NetDB node record so that the make and model are ""Samsung Chromebook"" and the operating system is ""Chrome OS""."
Device Security,What can an IT professional do if a user's device is not compliant?,"Sometimes users do everything they are supposed to do and a device is still listed as not compliant in MyDevices. If BigFix is installed but:
... the Windows 10 computer's MyDevices Encryption Status reports the device is not encrypted, there might be a problem with the VBScript that generates information locally on the Windows client for BigFix collection and reporting to MyDevices.
An end user or IT support person will have to take these steps:
Create a Scheduled Task to regularly run a script that updates the bitlockerinfo.txt file
Set up corrective bitlockerinfo.txt-updater script to run on a schedule. Batch script calls PowerShell script to address bug where a Bitlocker encyption status text file on rare occasion contains no field values. This state causes MyDevices to consider the computer non-compliant when it in fact may be BitLocker enabled and compliant. The schedule task manages this autonomously; but with the aid of a run-as-admin-shortcut to the ""run-get-bitlockerinfo-ps.bat"" batch script, a user can run the fix at will as necessary (this may require 8 hours for the fix to be recognized and reported to MyDevices).
Summary
The key components to this regularly scheduled fix-it batch script solution are:

get-bitlockerinfo.ps1 -- this PowerShell script sets the contents of the ""C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\BitLocker\bitlockerinfo.txt"" file with data to be collected by BigFix regarding BitLocker encryption status
run-get-bitlockerinfo-ps.bat -- this batch script calls the above PowerShell script; it is the target of the Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler task created either automatically or manually per below, and can optionally be run as administrator directly or via shortcut on demand

Automated Instructions for creating the Scheduled Task:

Download the ""bitlockerinfo-fix-files"" folder and the ""create-bitlockerinfo-fix-scheduled-task-#_#.bat"" file locally by extracting them from this zip file ; ensure both the folder and the file remain adjacent to each other
Run the ""create-bitlockerinfo-fix-scheduled-task-#_#.bat"" file as a local computer administrator
Confirm the ""Stanford - Daily Encryption Status Update #_#"" task has been created, scheduled to run hourly -- this can be adjusted to run less frequently per user preference

NOTE: When invoked by the scheduled task, the regularly scheduled batch script will flash a Command Prompt window visible to the user. This flash of a window immediately minimizes to the taskbar, then automatically terminates after approximately two seconds. Those two seconds are enough time to maximize the window and view the message indicating what is happening.
Troubleshooting
See ""C:\ProgramData\Stanford\Logs\StanfordScheduledTask-BitlockerTxt.log"" for clues on issues you might experience running the ""create-bitlockerinfo-fix-scheduled-task-#_#.bat"" batch script that automates the scheduled task creation.
Manual Instructions for creating the Schedule Task:

Download the ""bitlockerinfo-fix-files"" folder
Create a ""C:\ProgramData\Stanford"" folder, if it does not already exist; however, if this does not already exist, something else might be amiss (perhaps the BigFix client itself is problematic)
Move contents of the ""bitlockerinfo-fix-files"" folder to ""C:\ProgramData\Stanford""
Open Task Scheduler
Right-click Task Scheduler Library > Import Task... and target the ""Stanford_RoutineEncryptionStatusUpdater_1_1.xml_#_#.xml"" for import
Click Open
All settings should be in place (but you can change the schedule at this time per user preference via Triggers tab > Daily trigger selection > Edit... > setting the new time > click OK)
Click OK

NOTE: See note above about the flash of a command prompt window visible each time the scheduled task executes.
When properly set, the ""C:\Program Files (x86)\BigFix Enterprise\BES Client\BitLocker\bitlockerinfo.txt"" file contents of a fully encrypted Microsoft Windows BitLocker client look like this:
|~|OSDrive::C:|~|CipherStrength::Aes128|~|ProtectionStatus::On|~|EncryptionStatus::FullyEncrypted|~|PercentageEncrypted::100|~|Unlocked|~|WipingStatus::0|~|UnlockMethod::Password|~|RecoveryMethod::RecoveryPassword|~|
... the Management System Information in MyDevices is missing, incorrect, or out-of-date (see the ""Last Check-in Time""), there might be a problem with BigFix.
A BigFix administrator will have to take the first two steps, an end user or an IT support person the third:

Try a BigFix console refresh.
Deploy a BigFix action, ""[STANFORD] Troubleshooting: Client Forced Refresh"", to force a client refresh.
Completely remove and reinstall the BigFix client on the endpoint.

To completely remove BigFix on Windows, first look in the Programs and Features control panel. If you see ""IBM BigFix Client (Stanford)"", you can uninstall the client using the control panel. Note that the version of the BigFix installer that provides this functionality first became available in December 2016, so this option won't be available in many cases.
If you do not see ""(Stanford)"" appended to the program name in the Programs and Features control panel, in order to completely remove the client you must use the appropriate version of this utility (generally the most recent):
www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/Tivoli%20Endpoint%20Manager/page/BES%20Remove%20Utility
To completely remove BigFix on Mac OS, use the BigFix uninstaller script included with the BigFix installer disk image on Essential Stanford Software.
Sometimes the removal and reinstallation steps need to be repeated once or twice. If all else fails and the system will have no access to High Risk Data, try VLRE. Otherwise it might be necessary to rebuild the system."
Device Security,MyDevices Device Details,"Registered devices
The MyDevices app shows details of all your devices that are registered on the Stanford network so you can monitor your compliance with Stanford's information security mandates.
Information on this page comes from several source systems. If changes were made recently to a device you use (e.g., a new device was encrypted), MyDevices can take up to 24 hours to display those changes. Contact your local IT support or submit a Help ticket if you have questions or concerns about a device or its status.
To launch MyDevices, go to mydevices.stanford.edu. A list of your registered devices and the compliance status of each device displays.

If a device is listed as Compliant, the device complies with Stanford's information security mandates. If a device is listed as Not Compliant, you need to take action to make the device compliant.
If you see a device that you no longer use or has been transferred to someone else, you can click Remove to submit a request to remove the device from your record.
To see more information about a device, click the link in the Devices column to display the device details. If a device is not compliant, the reasons are listed.
View affiliations
You can check your current university affiliations and the information security mandate status for each affiliation. To do so, click the View Person Affiliations link on the center of the MyDevices home page to display your personal affiliation details:

Compliance status
If the compliance status is Not Compliant, the Device Details page will display actions you need to take to make the device compliant. After taking these actions, it can take up to 24 hours for the device status to change in MyDevices.
Weekly email notifications are sent to any faculty, staff, or postdoc who is using a  non-compliant device. You have a 30-day grace period to make the device compliant. The device details section lists the days remaining to bring the device into compliance, after which campus network access will be restricted.
Under the Notifications section, you can view the contents of an email notification by clicking the link above the date the email was sent.
Device information
After you select your device from the Devices list, you will be able to see the device status at a glance. You can easily navigate to the different types of device information. The new Status section provides additional information on device status. 

Click on any information icon () to see the system that is the source of the data displayed in a field.
If your computer is encrypted and you forget the password that unlocks the hard drive, you can retrieve your encryption key. See the Encryption Key Self-Recovery page for more information."
Device Security,Why are all users of a shared device being prompted to enroll the device?,"If BigFix is installed on a device, it will continue to prompt all new local users of a system to enroll the device until someone self-identifies as the primary user.

The primary user is the person responsible for a device's security and maintenance. This person uses the device more than anyone else, makes decisions about what applications are on it, or generally considers it their computer."
Device Security,Who should be listed as the primary user during device enrollment for shared devices?,"The primary user is the person responsible for a device's security and maintenance. In some cases a shared system, such as a lab or kiosk computer, has no primary user as such. In these cases it's usually most appropriate for the system administrator to list him- or herself as the primary user."
Device Security,What is device compliance?,"The University established a requirement to verifiably encrypt all Windows and Mac computers, as well as Apple and Android mobile devices that are used by employees on the campus network.All devices covered by the security mandate must be encrypted using the operating system's native encryption facilities. For Mac OS FileVault 2 is required, and for Windows desktop operating systems BitLocker is required. Mobile iOS and Android devices must be encrypted using their available built-in technologies.For Mac OS and Windows devices, either BigFix or VLRE must be installed in order to verify encryption in an ongoing way that can be centrally audited. Devices that have access to High Risk Data must have BigFix installed and be configured for Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) settings management .All faculty, staff and postdoc Apple and Android mobile devices used for Stanford activities on the campus network are subject to the verifiable encryption requirement. Mobile Device Management (MDM) is Stanford's mobile device security solution."
Device Security,Where can I find information about the School of Medicine security requirements?,See the Information Security Services page for information about the School of Medicine implementation of Stanford University security requirements.
Device Security,What is Stanford's computer security mandate?,"The computer security mandate's key requirement is verifiable encryption of all devices that meet any of these criteria:The device will be connected to the Stanford network (excluding Stanford Visitor and eduroam wireless networks, and sponsored wireless access for guests); orThe device is owned by Stanford regardless of location; orThe device will be used to access High Risk Data from any location regardless of ownership.All devices covered by the mandate must be encrypted using the operating system's native encryption facilities. For macOS FileVault 2 is required, and for Windows desktop operating systems BitLocker is required. Mobile iOS and Android devices must be encrypted using their available built-in technologies.In the case of macOS and Windows, either BigFix or VLRE must be used to verify encryption in an ongoing way that can be centrally audited. In the case of mobile iOS and Android devices, Stanford's Mobile Device Management service must be used. For more information see Security Requirements Questions and Answers."

Device Security,Getting Started with Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE),"Encryption can result in irretrievable loss of data if the keys or passphrases are misplaced or destroyed; consult a qualified system administrator if you feel you need assistance.
Getting started
With your manager, determine if it is absolutely necessary that you store Moderate or High Risk Data on your computer and that Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) is the best solution for you to protect University data. Please see the Information Security Office's Risk Classifications guide for more information.
The best protection of University data from computer loss or theft is to avoid storing it on a computer.
If you determine that you need to install Stanford Whole Disk Encryption, contact your local desktop support staff who can help you download and run the SWDE installer. Your computer will need to be part of your local BigFix domain.
With the assistance of the Service Desk or your local desktop support staff, you will download and run the SWDE installer, select an appropriate means to encrypt your system and begin the encryption process.
On Macintosh systems, native encryption is entirely transparent once enabled.  On Windows systems, the only noticeable difference is the need to enter another password of your choosing upon booting.
What it protects or prevents
Stanford Whole Disk Encryption protects your files if your computer is lost or stolen. If someone tries to break into your system to retrieve files, they will not be able to access the computer as long as they do not have the ability to log in. This is most useful for laptop computers and desktop systems with Moderate or High Risk Data.
What it doesn't protect or prevent
Stanford Whole Disk Encryption is limited to protecting the files while they are on your computer. It does not provide encryption to files that are:

sent via email;
kept on a separate flash drive/thumb drive/USB drive/floppy disk; or
moved over the network via shared folders.

When you move an encrypted file off of your computer, it is no longer encrypted,
If you forget your passphrase or your passphrase changes
The PIN created for use with BitLocker should be different from your SUNetID password. They will be not synchronized with your SUNet ID password. If you are unable to log in for some reason, you can contact University IT or your local support provider. Call (650) 725-4357 or submit a Help ticket. 
What to expect

The initial encryption process can be resource-intensive on your computer, so plan a time when you can leave your computer plugged into AC power and a time when you can tolerate a slowdown in performance. 
You must follow the best practice of password protecting your computer at all times, including stand by, sleep, hibernate, and via screen savers. This practice is fundamental to the success of the Whole Disk Encryption technology and the accompanying audit. 
Once installed, encryption takes place in the background all the time; each new file is encrypted automatically. 
Your computer will become a member of the local BigFix domain. 
Removal of whole disk encryption is a very time-consuming process and is not recommended. If necessary it can be enabled by University IT staff to guarantee the integrity of the audit trail. Plan to remove the encryption when you can tolerate a very slow machine for over 10 hours..

Device Security,What should an IT professional know about encrypting multiple fixed disks?,"IMPORTANT:

For Windows, we can only escrow BitLocker recovery keys for the system volume. Any additional volumes encrypted using BitLocker need to have their recovery keys manually recorded, by saving them to a removable drive, or printing them out, or writing them down.For Windows, be sure BitLocker is configured to be unlocked automatically.Be sure your computer is being backed up before encrypting.

Multi-boot systems in the general case cannot be encrypted. Unofficial instructions for encrypting Apple Boot Camp devices can be found on the web, but the steps are many and complicated. For most purposes, it's almost always preferable to run additional operating systems in a virtual machine. If a system must remain multi-boot, the user should request a compliance exception.

Device Security,What is VLRE?,"For computers that do not handle High Risk Data, SWDE is recommended but there is an option to install VLRE (Very Lightweight Reporting Engine, pronounced “velour”), a read-only agent that provides encryption verification without requiring BigFix. VLRE periodically reports on the computer's encryption and screen saver password status, but leaves maintenance of the computer entirely to the user. If your computer is not encrypted, the VLRE installer steps you through the encryption process."

Device Security,NetDB Record Creation and Modification Rights,"Within NetDB, rights to modify a record are granted only through the ""Group"" and ""Record Type"" fields. Most NetDB users only need to create or modify ""Node"" record types, sometimes ""Advanced Node"" records. 

In order to be able to create a node within an IP range, the NetDB user has to share a NetDB Group with the IP range. For example, if the NetDB user ""George Jetson"" is only a member of the Groups ""Stanford"" and ""Cogswell Cogs,"" but 10.10.10.0/24 only allows users in the Group ""Spacely Sprockets"" to create IP numbers in that range, then George Jetson cannot create IP numbers in that range. He would need to put in a ticket requesting that one of his Groups have rights to that range. Access to an IP range must be granted by Group, not by individual user or list of users, or Admin Team.

If George Jetson wants to modify a record, that record has to have at least one of his Groups associated with it. If there is a Node record ""Cosmo-Spacely.Stanford.EDU"" that has only the ""Spacely Sprockets"" group associated with it, then George Jetson cannot modify that record, even if he is listed as the Node Administrator or if that record is in an IP range to which he normally has access. 

The NetDB field ""Administrator"" is only used to list which individuals or Admin Teams are custodians for a particular physical or virtual device, not for the NetDB record. It does not grant any access to modify a NetDB record. Adding someone as an Administrator does not grant any rights within NetDB, it only provides contact information should someone have questions about a physical or virtual device.

A NetDB ""Admin Team"" is a convenient way to list more than one person a custodian for a physical or virtual device. The Administrator field must be a person from the Stanford directory, and will create a link to that individual's directory entry for phone number or email. An Admin Team can have a shared email or phone number associated with it, which is often much more convenient.

Nearly every NetDB user is a member of the ""Stanford"" group. This allows them to create records within the Stanford.EDU domain. Domain records also have Groups associated with them, so if your organization needs 3rd level domains, then rights to create records within those domains can be limited by Group membership.

If a NetDB Node record needs to be passed from one NetDB user to another, the easiest way to do that is to add the ""Stanford"" group to that Node, remove all other groups, and inform the other user that they can modify that Node. The other user should then add one or more Groups to which they have rights and remove the ""Stanford"" Group.

Device Security,Back Up Your Encryption Recovery Key (Windows),"If your computer is encrypted and you forget the password that unlocks your hard drive, you'll need the encryption recovery key to unlock your drive. In most cases, Stanford users have their recovery keys backed up in a secure database by the university. The recovery key can then be retrieved in MyDevices.
Due to a bug that has now been fixed, some recovery keys that were saved using the Stanford Whole Disk Encryption (SWDE) service cannot be retrieved in MyDevices. You can check to see if any device belonging to you has a key available for retrieval in MyDevices.
If your device is encrypted but your encryption recovery key cannot be retrieved in MyDevices, you can use the Key Escrow Tool to fix the problem.

If already installed, proceed to step five.Go to Splunk Universal Forwarder for Linux Servers for installation and configuration instructions. Be sure to set a valid index in inputs.conf, as explained in the instructions.Note:  Cloud-based and private-network hosts forward logs to a host they can connect to internally using rsyslog. The rsyslog host then forwards all logs to Splunk using Splunk Universal Forwarder. This requires a privileged connection, like a VPN connection.For more information about rsyslog, see Splunk via rsyslog for Linux Servers.Add the following stanzas to /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf in order to configure the forwarding of logs from OSSEC to Splunk:
[monitor:///var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log]​
disabled=0
sourcetype=ossec_alerts

[monitor:///var/ossec/logs/ossec.log]​
disabled=0​
sourcetype=ossec_log​

[monitor:///var/ossec/logs/active-responses.log]​

<ignore> statements may not work to exclude a directory from scanning, if the parent directory is included for scanning.
Start the OSSEC service when you are done configuring it:
service ossec start
Confirm the OSSEC service is running normally. This can be done by checking the local status of the OSSEC service in /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log. As soon as the service starts, a log like this should appear in the log file:
2017 Jun 29 07:52:27 basecamp->ossec-monitord
Rule: 502 (level 3) -> 'Ossec server started.'
ossec: Ossec started.
After about 15 minutes of operation, new entries should appear in the log file showing that initial system checks were completed by OSSEC.Verify that logs are being forwarded to Splunk using a simple search. For example, if your hostname is ‘stanford555’, your search will look like this:​

Servers,UNIX Documentation at Stanford,"Legacy documentation for UNIX that was once part of the timeshare service documentation has moved to the FarmShare wiki.
Examples of UNIX documentation available on the wiki include:

X Window System"
Servers,Scheduling Commands and Scripts,"Overview
The scheduling service allows you to run commands or scripts at specified intervals. The scripts are stored in AFS. The commands are called “cron jobs,” and they're useful for a variety of purposes such as rebuilding a search index hourly, updating a web site daily, or running monthly reports on databases. You can use the scheduling service tool to create new jobs or edit existing ones.

Flexible schedule: schedule jobs through an easy-to-use web interface.
Dedicated servers: run your specified jobs from a pool of dedicated servers. You don't have to run your own server for cron jobs or use any other UNIX machine where updates and reboots can affect scheduled jobs.
Shared administration: run jobs as a CGI principal (jdoe.cgi), a cron principal (jdoe.cron), or a group or department's CGI principal (dept-example.cgi — this allows other members of that group to administer the settings).

Run administrative tasks automatically
The admin for a Drupal website must run some tasks regularly: for example, update the index search, trim the logs, and check for security updates. Drupal provides a web page that will run these tasks for you, but it requires regular visits to this page every day (or every hour).
Instead, you can use the scheduling service to perform these tasks. Use the web page provided by Drupal to run these tasks — known as “cron.php” — and a UNIX program called “curl” that can request web pages from the command line. Then use the service to schedule a job that uses curl to request cron.php at regular intervals with the following command:
curl -sS https://www.stanford.edu/dept/example/cgi-bin/drupal/cron.php
The two flags (-sS) tell curl to be silent unless there are errors.
Set Access Control Lists (ACLs)
If you are using the scheduling service to run a script, it is important to assign the appropriate Access Control List (ACL) in the script's parent directory so that the CGI principal can run the script. (If you're unsure of what ACLs are and what they do, see the Setting Permissions with UNIX page for more information.)
For example, if you are running a script as group-foo/cgi at /afs/ir/group/foo/cgi-bin/tools/foo.sh
then you can fix the permissions problems by assigning the rlidwk ACLs (read, lookup, insert, delete, write, and lock permissions) to the group-foo.cgi file in the directory /afs/ir/group/foo/cgi-bin/tools.
Run the following command from anywhere you have access to AFS ACLs and press Enter:
fs sa /afs/ir/group/foo/cgi-bin/tools group-foo.cgi rlidwk
The directory permissions are reset and the cron job errors should stop.
Get started
To get started, first determine what command or script in AFS you'd like to run and then visit the scheduler's web interface at tools.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/scheduler."
Servers,Using VNC with FarmShare,"On this page:

Introduction
Before you begin
VNC on Mac OS X
VNC on Windows
VNC on UNIX/Linux

Introduction
UNIX/Linux applications with a graphical user interface require the use of special display software when connecting from a remote location. Two methods are currently supported: X-windows and VNC. See Using X-windows for information about X-windows.
VNC is a protocol and associated software that supports remote display on a variety of computer platforms. It is useful when certain applications fail to run properly under X-windows, or when a persistent connection to the remote display is required. You can disconnect from a VNC session and reconnect to it later as long as the terminal session used to start the VNC server application is still running.
The university maintains the necessary server application for use with Stanford FarmShare, but users must download and install a suitable client application; see below for recommendations. Because secure connections are required in the Stanford FarmShare environment, SSH must be used to encrypt the VNC connection. SSH does not have any special support for VNC so encryption must be accomplished manually using SSH port forwarding.
Before you begin
If you have never used VNC before you must set a VNC password before you start vncserver for the first time (see below). This password will control access to the display and will prevent a third-party from viewing or controlling your VNC session.

Connect to any Stanford UNIX rice.
Create a VNC application directory if one does not already exist:mkdir ~/.vnc
Run the vncpasswd command to set a new password. This password is not very secure, so it should not be the same as your SUNet ID password (or other sensitive passwords).

Using VNC on Mac OS X
There are a number of freely available VNC clients for Mac OS X. Of these turbovnc is the best performing. Please follow the steps outlined in the wiki to download and create your session.
Using VNC on Windows
There are a number of freely available VNC clients for Windows, but SSVNC is recommended for most users. This client includes built-in support for SSH tunnelling of the VNC display, which streamlines the connection procedure. You must also have SecureCRT or another SSH client installed in order to establish a primary terminal session. Please follow the steps outlined in the wiki to download and create your session.
Using VNC on UNIX/Linux
Some distributions of Linux include a VNC client as part of the default desktop configuration, but others are freely available. Check the standard software repositories for your distribution to determine the options. If turbovnc is available then that would make a great choice. Please follow the steps outlined in the wiki to download and create your session."
Servers,Using X-windows with FarmShare,"On this page:

Introduction
XQuartz on Mac OS X
Xming on Windows
X11 on UNIX/Linux

Introduction
UNIX/Linux applications with a graphical user-interface require the use of special display software when connecting from a remote location. Two methods are currently supported: X-windows and VNC. X-windows (X11) is recommended for most users, but VNC is useful when certain applications fail to run properly under X-windows, or when a persistent connection to the remote display is required. See Using VNC for information about VNC.
X-windows is the native display technology on UNIX and Linux systems and is designed for networked use. Because secure connections are required in the Stanford timeshare environment, SSH must be used to encrypt the X-windows connection; most SSH clients have built-in support for X display forwarding.
Using XQuartz on OS X
XQuartz is a free X11 server implementation for OS X. You can download the XQuartz application at MacOSForge.

Verify that XQuartz is installed and launch the XQuartz application (located in the Utilities subfolder of the Applications folder). An xterm window should open by default. If no terminal window opens, start one by selecting Terminal from the File menu or pressing COMMAND + N.
You may need to restart your computer after the installation of XQuartz, so try that if the following doesn't immediately work for you.
In xterm, connect to any Stanford timeshare using the ssh command. You must specify the -X option to enable display forwarding. (If the -X option doesn't work try -Y.) For example:ssh -X sunetid@rice.stanford.edu In some cases, enabling compression by specifying the -C option can improve performance, especially when connecting from outside the campus network:ssh -CX sunetid@rice.stanford.edu
Authenticate using your SUNet ID password. After connecting, the remote machine will display a standard prompt, as with normal connections, but remote applications with a graphical user-interface will automatically use the local display.
To end the session, quit all remote applications, type exit to close the SSH connection.  You can also quit XQuartz if you like.

Using MobaXterm on Windows
The easiest thing to do on Windows is to use the free personal version of MobaXterm which includes an X11 server:  https://web.stanford.edu/group/farmshare/cgi-bin/wiki/index.php/Mobaxterm
Using Xming on Windows
Xming is a freely available X server for Windows. It uses PuTTY, a built-in SSH client, to forward the display.
Note: These instructions assume you are using the version of PuTTY built into and distributed with Xming. You do not need to have a separate copy of PuTTY installed; if you do have a separate copy installed you should not start a separate instance of PuTTY with X-Windows forwarding enabled  before connecting, unless you have configured Xming accordingly. Users of PuTTY may want to review the suggested configuration.

Download and install the public domain releases of Xming and Xming-fonts. The default installation options for Xming should be sufficient. The 100dpi, Trutype, and Deja Vu fonts available in Xming-fonts are optional, but recommended.
Once installation is complete, run Xming.

You can configure the display settings for each session as desired, but Multiple windows is standard.
Select the option to Start a program.
Use the default program, xterm, but choose Run Remote Using PuTTY Link (plink.exe) and make sure With compression is checked.
- You may connect to any Stanford timeshare computer (e.g., corn.stanford.edu). Log in using your SUNet ID, but leave the Password field blank; you will be prompted for your SUNet ID password upon connection.
No special parameter settings are required.


Optionally, save this configuration for future use, and then connect, providing your password when required. An xterm window will open and the remote machine will display a standard UNIX prompt, as with normal connections. However, remote applications with a graphical user-interface will automatically use the local display.
To end the session, quit all remote applications, type exit to close the xterm window. Xming will quit automatically when the xterm window is closed.

Using X11 on UNIX/Linux
Because X11 is the native display technology on UNIX and Linux systems it is possible to connect to any Stanford timeshare for remote display simply by opening a Terminal window and running ssh with the -X option.

Open a Terminal window and connect to any Stanford timeshare using the ssh command with the -X option. (If the -X option doesn't work try -Y.) For example:ssh -X sunetid@rice.stanford.edu In some cases, enabling compression by specifying the -C option can improve performance, especially when connecting from outside the campus network:ssh -CX sunetid@rice.stanford.edu
Authenticate using your SUNet ID password. After connecting, the remote machine will display a standard prompt, as with normal connections, but remote applications with a graphical user-interface will automatically use the local display.
To end the session, quit all remote applications and type exit to close the SSH connection."
Servers,FarmShare Policies,"Overview
This document outlines the conditions of use for the FarmShare computers run by University IT. First and foremost, all use of these machines is covered by the policies set forth in Stanford University's Administrative Guide , which defines overall university computing policy.
If you are a student, the Fundamental Standard applies to your use of these systems. If you are faculty, staff, or a part-time worker (including a student employee), the University Code of Conduct applies to your use of these systems.
If you have any questions, please submit a Help ticket.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Rules for all FarmShare machines
These policies apply to the academic quarter, which is defined as starting on the first day of instruction on the Undergraduate Calendar and running though the last day of finals. Summer quarter (the longest of the Summer terms available) is included.
Note: There may be individual machines, or classes of machines, that are excluded from these limits. These exceptions will be noted in each machine's login message, also known as the “Message of the Day” (motd).

These resources may not be used for commercial purposes.
Users are not allowed to try to gain unauthorized access into any computer, nor are users allowed to test for system vulnerabilities.  Users also may not use these systems for making such attempts against other systems within, or outside of, Stanford.
The ""/tmp"" space on each system is for temporary storage. Around midnight, files that have not been touched for 24 hours get deleted automatically. Users are allowed to run programs that circumvent this automatic process (e.g., ""tmptouch"" scripts), but not for more than 2 weeks.
Users may not run distributed clients such as distributed.net, SETI@Home, or Folding@home, except by prior arrangement for a class.
Users may not run public servers, such as chat rooms or database servers, except by prior arrangement for a class.
Users may not run any program that debilitates the computer on which it is running or debilitates other systems. Examples of this include, but are not limited to:

Running a program that uses up most of the system memory.
Filling up the ""/tmp"" space on a system. Users should not be using more than a third of the available tmp space on a system.
Running a program that does heavy disk I/O and is writing files into the general AFS space. Use /tmp space for such programs, then copy any files you wish to keep into AFS space periodically, or when the program is done.


May not be used to transmit, store, or compute with Prohibited or Restricted Information, as defined by the Stanford University Data Classification criteria.

Additional rules for rice machines

During the regular academic quarter, users are limited to 10 concurrent CPU-intensive, or memory-intensive, programs. If you require more resources, please use the wheat machines. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, Matlab, SAS, gaussian, and many java programs."
Servers,Logging in to FarmShare,"Introduction
This document presumes that you've already obtained your SUNet ID and are now ready to log in to one of the shared UNIX workstations to check files, create a web page, or obtain other computing services. The way you log in depends on where you are, what software you are using, and other factors. This document will point you in the right direction for each login option.
Logging in remotely
To log in from your office, dorm, or public computer cluster, the computer you're working on must have a program that gives you ""SSH"" capability, or have the ability to put AFS onto your desktop. If you don't have one of these programs installed on your computer already, you can get one free from the Essential Stanford Software site on the web. You can also obtain a copy from your RCC (for students) or your local Expert Partner (for faculty and staff).
SecureCRT (Windows)
An excellent set of step by step instructions can be found on the Configuring SecureCRT page.
LelandSSH (OS X)
LelandSSH is available for Macintosh download via Essential Stanford Software. See the  Leland SSH Installation and Use page for more information.
Put AFS onto your desktop
You don't have to use UNIX to put up web pages, store documents, etc. If you put AFS on the desktop of your Macintosh or Windows computer, you can do all of these things directly using a simple drag and drop interface. Go to the AFS on the Desktop page for more information.
Remote connection via X11 or VNC (X-Windows)
You can also log in remotely via X11 or VNC. See Using X-windows or Using VNC for instructions for this method.
For more information
If you have questions about how to log in to the FarmShare systems, see the FarmShare wiki, the Getting Connected to FarmShare page, or submit a Help ticket."
Servers,FarmShare Software,"FarmShare provides access to many software packages; some notable examples are:

ANSYS
Julia
Mathematica
MATLAB
R
SAS
Stata

These include commercial software, which is licensed for use on FarmShare systems in coursework, but not for research.
Other software provided by the standard Ubuntu repositories may be available upon request, and Research Computing may be able to accommodate courses with special requirements. Instructors should contact research-computing-support@stanford.edu at least one month in advance for assistance.
FarmShare users can build and install additional software in their AFS home directories, or in per-user directories in /farmshare/user_data. Package managers like Linuxbrew and Spack can automate this process for many popular applications and libraries, and some programming environments provide similar tools for installing modules (e.g., pip install --user for Python).

Mobile Devices,How to Correct an iOS device That Has Disconnected From Workspace ONE (AirWatch),"iOS devices enrolled in Stanford's Mobile Device Management (MDM) service, Workspace ONE (formerly known as AirWatch), may have recently lost communication with the admin console due to a vendor configuration issue.
If your device was affected, you should follow the steps below to unenroll it from Workspace ONE and then re-enroll it. This will ensure your device can be verified as compliant and continues to work with all Stanford applications. 
Before you begin

To ensure uninterrupted access to your Stanford email and calendar from your mobile device, re-enroll your device immediately after you complete unenrollment process.
After you unenroll your device, you can continue to access your email on another computer or device or use Webmail (https://webmail.stanford.edu) temporarily on your iOS device.
The size of the mailbox and calendar determines how long the re-enrollment takes. Typically, the process is completed in a few minutes, but extremely large mailboxes and calendars may take several hours to fully download.
It’s recommended that your device be connected to a Wi-Fi network during enrollment because of the bandwidth used to download your email and calendar.

Step One: Unenroll your device

Locate the Hub app on your device. Note: If you cannot find the Hub app, skip this section and follow the steps listed below under ""Step Two: Delete Device Management Profile"" to manually delete the profile.
Open the Hub app. Tap This Device and then select Enrollment.
Select Unenroll Device. 
When you see the warning message, tap Unenroll to confirm.
Upon un-enrollment, Stanford apps will be removed and your Stanford email and calendar will likely be deleted. Once this process is complete you’ll see the enrollment prompt in the Hub app. Before you re-enroll your device, follow the steps under ""Step Two: Delete Device Management Profile"" to verify the Device Management Profile is deleted.

Step Two: Delete Device Management Profile
Your Device Management profile may not delete during un-enrollment or you may have to delete it manually if the Hub app is missing. Follow these steps to confirm the Device Management Profile has been removed and to delete it manually, if necessary.

On your device, go to Settings > General.
Scroll down toward the bottom of the list to see if Device Manager is displayed.

If Device Management is missing your un-enrollment is complete and you can follow the steps below under the section ""Step Three: Re-enroll Your Device."" 
If you see Device Management displayed, open it, and select Device Management.


At the bottom of the screen, select Remove Management.

Step Three: Re-enroll Your Device
Now you are ready to re-enroll your device. To do this, visit the University IT webpage Enroll an iOS Device in Mobile Device Management and follow the steps under ""Enroll in MDM."""

Calendar,Calendar Best Practices,"Best Practices for Microsoft 365 CalendaringUniversity IT offers the following recommendations to keep calendar usage consistent, courteous, and professional. Some departments may want to incorporate a subset of these practices in a policy they establish for how their employees should use the Microsoft 365 Calendar.Use Preferred ClientsOWA (Outlook Web App), Microsoft Outlook, and the Outlook mobile app are the recommended clients. Keep current with Microsoft Office Updates - There are known issues that are fixed with each service pack or update. Make sure your mobile device has the latest OS/iOS version. If you must use a mobile device to manage your calendar, use the Outlook app to accept/decline meeting requests. It is recommended that mobile devices only be used for viewing your calendar. Mobile devices tend to cause the most issues with appointments becoming corrupt, missing, or out of sync. Scheduling an appointment just for yourself on your mobile device is ok. DelegatesOnly ONE person should process meeting invites - Make sure that only one user for each mailbox receives and processes meeting requests. If you have more than one delegate, having only one receive the meeting requests is preferred. If more than one receives the requests, the delegates and owner must decide who will be processing all the meeting requests. All other computers/devices and people should ignore (i.e. do not process, do not delete) meeting requests for the mailbox if they receive them.Creating and Editing MeetingsIt is recommended that meeting creation and edits are done on OWA (Outlook Web App). Microsoft Outlook can be used for your own calendar use but for any calendar delegation it is recommended to use OWA (Outlook Web App)If you must cancel or reschedule a meeting, please try to notify attendees at least 24 hours before the scheduled start time. Many staff check their calendars only at the beginning of their day. Last-minute changes or cancellations can go unnoticed.If you want to invite people to a meeting without letting them know who else is invited, please send an email rather than an appointment. All meeting attendees can see who else is invited, but cannot see their attendance status. Only the organizer of the meeting can see attendee status.When inviting a group to a meeting, invite using individual email addresses (or a Contact Group). Do not invite Mailman mailing lists to a meeting. While the list may have a free schedule, the members of the list may be busy. When a member responds, that person’s email address will be added to the invitation, and the member will receive two copies of all further messages about that meeting.Handling Meeting Requests
	Respond to meeting invitations promptly with an Accept, Decline, or Tentative. By making a choice, you keep the meeting organizer informed so that they can better decide if they need to reschedule an appointment, plan for refreshments, or work with you outside of the scheduled meeting time.

	Always Respond to Meeting Requests in the Inbox - We recommend that you always accept or decline a meeting request from the Inbox. If you accept or decline a meeting by using the meeting item in the Calendar in Outlook, the meeting request remains in the Inbox. It is important that you do not delete a meeting request from the Inbox until you are sure that the meeting has been processed. The following text appears in the InfoBar of the meeting request when the meeting request has been processed: Accepted by username on date, time.

	Don’t copy/paste meeting events.  These are especially susceptible to corruption and causing problems.

	Don't move meeting requests - Don't move a meeting request from your Inbox to a different folder before you accept or decline the request or before the meeting appears in your calendar. Soon after a meeting request arrives in your Inbox, a piece of Outlook code — nicknamed the ""sniffer"" — automatically adds the meeting to your calendar and marks it as tentative. This is a fail-safe to keep you from missing the meeting in case you don't see the request in your Inbox. However, the sniffer doesn't reply to the meeting organizer. You still need to do that by accepting, accepting as tentative, or declining the request. If you or a rule that you create moves an incoming meeting request from your Inbox before the sniffer can process the request, the meeting never appears in your calendar, and you might miss the meeting.

	Don't delete a meeting request on one computer after you accept the same meeting request on another computer - If you are using two computers that connect to the same mailbox (e.g., a desktop computer that is using Online mode and a laptop computer that is using Cached Exchange Mode). The meeting request that you accepted on the Desktop computer is immediately processed. The meeting request that you deleted on the laptop computer is synchronized later. After synchronization, the meeting on the desktop computer is also deleted.

	Don't auto-accept meeting requests - If you have granted one or more persons delegate access to your calendar or if you have delegate access to someone else's calendar, turn off automatic acceptance of meeting requests. By turning off automatic acceptance you avoid problems with delegate workflow by allowing you and/or your delegate the opportunity to review all meeting requests, respond appropriately, keep track of meetings and any changes, as well as minimize schedule conflicts.

	If you receive a meeting cancellation, click Remove from Calendar to remove the meeting from your calendar - Deleting the cancellation from your Inbox won't remove the meeting from your calendar when using some clients.

	Do not forward meeting requests - the meeting attendee list becomes out of date and tracking does not work properly for the forwarded users.  Any updates to the meeting are only sent to the original attendees, not the forwarded users. If you feel a colleague should also attend, email the organizer of the meeting and ask to have that individual added. No one likes surprise guests.​
	Recurring Meetings
	Schedule end dates on recurring meetings - It is recommended that you set an end date (no more than 12 months) when you schedule a recurring meeting. When you add a definite end date, you may prevent issues that may occur if you have to update the meeting several times. If you schedule an end date on meetings, you can create a new meeting if you realize that the meeting has to be frequently modified.

	If you want to discontinue a recurring meeting, open the series and add an end date. All meetings scheduled after that date will be deleted automatically from the attendees’ calendars. If you delete the series entirely, all past occurrences of the meeting are removed as well.

	To change an entire series of meetings, cancel the original meeting and create a new one.  To change one instance, cancel just that meeting and create a new one to replace it.  Always put an end date on a recurring meeting.

	A ""corrupt"" meeting will remain that way until you delete it.  If it is a recurring appointment, delete all occurrences and reschedule it.

	Avoid frequent changes - Recurring meetings can become lost or duplicated if they are modified too many times. If you have a series that requires many changes, like multiple location changes, cancel the series for everyone and create individual meetings instead or shorten the recurrence period to 3-6 months instead of 1 year or more. 
	​OtherNotes included in the body of the Appointment Details are emailed to all meeting attendees. Keep private meeting notes separate.Block times on your calendar when you are not available. This includes vacation time as well as setting your calendar to show when you are routinely out of the office. Your closest colleagues may be aware that you work an unusual schedule, but others may not and could request a meeting with you before your train arrives in the morning or after your carpool leaves in the afternoon.When scheduling a vacation day on your calendar, be sure to show your time as Free if you are inviting others.Troubleshooting​

Calendar,Share your calendar in an email,"If you don't want to give someone permissions to share your calendar and see updates, you can email a static copy of your calendar for a specific date range. The recipient will be able to see the events on your calendar at the time you sent the email, but not any updates you make after you send the email.
Click Calendar.Click Home > E-mail Calendar.In the Calendar and Date Range boxes, pick the calendar and time period you want to share. For example, choose Today only or for the Next 7 days.Set any other options you want, and then click OK.In the new email that opens, add who you want the message to go to in the To field, add a message if you want, and click Send.
The person you sent your calendar to will see a snapshot of your calendar in the message.

The message also includes an attached iCalendar (.ics) file that they can open in Outlook or another calendar program. When the recipient clicks the iCalendar file, Outlook displays the file as a new calendar that they can view side-by-side with their calendar. They can drag appointments or meetings between the two calendars, and find a time that works for both of you.

Calendar,Office 365 Shared Calendar Not Showing in Outlook 2016,"Symptom
A calendar has been shared, but is only viewable to the person it has been shared with in Webmail, not the Outlook client.
Resolution/Workaround
This is a known issue for calendars that are in the Office 365 cloud. Outlook clients are only able to see events on a shared Office 365 calendar if they are granted Reviewer rights or above.

Once permission level of Reviewer or greater is granted, you can customize the specific rights from there as appropriate. The Outlook client user should still be able to see the shared calendar events."

Calendar,How to Designate Who Can Schedule a Resource,"The best practice for reserving a meeting room or resource, such as a car, is to invite the resource to  a meeting via the attendee list.  Most resources at Stanford are open so that anyone within Stanford can reserve (invite) the resource.  Some resources restrict who has the ability to invite and view availability of the resource.  
If the resource is restricted to a list of users, the list is stored in the resource's calendar options.  The options are only accessible by the resource owner or admin, and is only available from Outlook on the web.
Note: The rights to see details of a calendar or to be able to directly edit the calendar are granted by setting the permissions on the calendar by right-clicking the calendar.   These permissions are separate from restrictions placed on inviting the resource, which is discussed below.

Before your begin, check the setting in the upper-right, just beneath the banner,  to make sure you are not using the new Outlook. You will not be able to access the resource calendar settings in the new Outlook.

Open a resource calendar
Log in to webmail.stanford.edu.Click your name or picture in the top-right corner and then click Open another mailbox.Enter name or email address of the resource and click Open. This opens the resource account in a new tab.
Limit who can schedule a resource
Click the gear icon to open the Settings menu and then click Calendar.In the Options panel on the left side of the window, navigate to Calendar > Resource scheduling.In the Scheduling permissions section, locate the  These people can schedule automatically if the resource is available setting. If Specific people and groups is selected, this calendar only accepts invites from the people in the list.​Click the list to add or remove users.Click Save.Click <-Options to close the Resource scheduling settings window.
Limit who can see the resource availability
To avoid potential confusion for users who can't book the resource it is best practice to limit who can see the calendar's availability by adjusting the permissions described below.
In the tab displaying the resource calendar, switch to the Calendar application. In the menu bar just below the banner, click Share. Change the permissions for My Organization to Not shared. Add a new permission entry for each person who has access to schedule the resource. They should have least Can view when I'm busy permissions. Click Done to save your changes."
Calendar,What Should I Do When My iPhone Calendar and Outlook/Webmail Are Not Syncing?,"Description
Calendar events created from the native iPhone Calendar app are not syncing to your Outlook or Webmail calendar. However, calendar events created in Outlook or Webmail show up on your iPhone calendar just fine.
Cause
The default calendar on the iPhone is not set to your Stanford calendar. Therefore, events initiated on the iPhone are being saved to a different calendar. This results in the event showing up on your iPhone but not your Outlook or Webmail calendar.
Resolution
Change your iPhone's default calendar and re-save all existing events to your Stanford calendar. This requires changing your iPhone's settings, but ensures events will show up on both your iPhone and Outlook/Webmail calendar going forward.

Go to Settings > Calendar (or Mail, Contact, Calendars).
Tap Default Calendar.
Select the Stanford calendar as your default.
Re-save ""missing events"" to the Stanford calendar. For each existing calendar event not on your Outlook/Webmail calendar:

Open the calendar event and tap Edit.
Tap on the Calendar field.
Select the Stanford calendar.
Tap Back and return to your calendar (the change is saved automatically).



Workaround #1
Download the Microsoft Outlook app and use it going forward for all your Stanford email and calendaring needs.
Workaround #2

Check the calendar field whenever you are creating or editing a calendar event on your iPhone and ensure the correct calendar is selected.
Select the Stanford calendar when appropriate."

Research Systems,Cayuse Outgoing Subawards Guide,"Stanford Electronic Research Administration

Cayuse 424 – Outgoing Subaward Quick Guide – Stanford will Issue a Subaward
Scenario #1: Stanford is the pass through institution, our subrecipient uses Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs.  - Importing a Cayuse Subaward Proposal
The subrecipient institution can create a standalone subaward proposal within their Cayuse account, export it as a .cayuse file, and send it to us via email. We then import the subaward proposal into our prime proposal. See the current list of institutions that use Cayuse 424.
1. Request from the subrecipient institution that they prepare a standalone subaward proposal, export it in a .cayuse file format and email it you. Save the file somewhere convenient on your computer or shared drive.
2. Navigate to Cayuse 424 from SeRA at https://sera.stanford.edu

3.Select the prime proposal you are developing. 

4. From within your prime proposal, on the left-hand navigation panel, click the check box next to the RR Subaward Budget Attachment form to include the form with your submission. Click the form itself.
5. Click the Import Subaward button from within the R&R SUBAWARD BUDGET ATTACHMENT(S) FORM.

6. An Import Subaward dialog box will open.

Select a name for the subaward.
Browse and select the .cayuse subaward proposal file you received from the subrecipient.
Click the Import button.

7. A Link in Subaward Proposal dialog box will open. Review the budget periods of the prime and subaward. Click Link in Subaward (or Cancel if you need to make additional modifications before import).

8. A Importing Key Persons and Performance Site data dialog box will open. Allow for any data to completely load, and click Finish.

9. The subaward proposal will open and be linked to your prime proposal.  You can edit both the prime and sub proposals as needed.
Scenario #2 Stanford is the pass through institution, our subrecipient does NOT use Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs. - Importing a Subawards.com Proposal
Institutions that do not use Cayuse can easily and quickly create subaward proposals for importing into Cayuse 424 proposals at http://subawards.com free of charge. Subawards.com has robust customer support and resources to respond to questions a subrecipient may have.

Request your subrecipient institution to go to http://subawards.com to initiate, complete, and export a standalone subaward proposal in the .cayuse file format.
Have your subrecipient institution send their standalone subaward proposal .cayuse file to you via email. Save the file somewhere convenient on your computer or shared drive.
Follow steps 2-9 of the above Scenario #1 to import the sub proposal to your prime proposal.

Scenario #3 Stanford is the pass through institution, our subrecipient does NOT use Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs. - Importing subaward data directly from Adobe Grants.gov (Workspace) forms.
Institutions that do not use Cayuse may complete the Grants.gov downloadable Adobe subaward budget form being used by the relative federal opportunity # and send it to Stanford for upload/importing into Stanford’s Cayuse. 
1. Request from the subrecipient institution they complete and email the relative Grants.gov downloadable Adobe subaward budget form being used by the federal opportunity # to which you are applying in addition to any other required application components i.e. subaward Key Personnel Biosketches etc.

To identify which Grants.gov subaward budget form is being used by your opportunity #...


Navigate to the Cayuse Opportunities tab.
Look up the opportunity # to which you are applying.
Click the “i” icon next to the relative opportunity Number. 
An Opportunity Details dialogue box will open. Under Forms you will see which forms are supported by this opportunity including which sub budget form.

2. Upon receipt of the files from the subrecipient save the file(s) somewhere convenient on your computer or shared drive.
3. Follow steps 2-9 of the above Scenario #1: to import the sub proposal to your prime proposal.
4. Upload any other required subaward application components i.e. subaward Key Personnel Biosketches etc.
Notes on Importing Adobe PDF Subaward Budget Forms:
Calculated Totals - Cayuse 424 imports all budget data except calculated totals. Line items and their amounts are imported and then Cayuse 424 calculates totals.
Attachments - Cayuse 424 is able to import most attachments found in Adobe PDF forms, such as a subaward budget justification.  However, budget overflow attachments for Additional Senior Key Persons and Additional Equipment are not imported the same way. Instead, items for those overflow attachments must be entered in the budget form within Cayuse 424 so the application can perform operations on that data, including calculating totals and generating the necessary overflow attachments for you. For this reason, Senior Key Persons and/or Equipment that is to appear in an overflow attachment must be entered manually in Cayuse 424.
Scenario #4 Stanford is the pass through institution, our subrecipient does NOT use Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs. – Creating a Subaward Proposal within Stanford’s Cayuse
In addition to being able to import subaward proposals, Stanford Cayuse users can also create subaward proposals from within a prime proposal. 
To facilitate creation of a subawards proposals, it is best if there is already an institutional profile for the subrecipient institution and professional profiles for the subrecipient institution Key Persons in Stanford’s Cayuse.  Users can create and edit these through the People and Institutions tabs in Cayuse.  At a minimum, the subrecipient institutional profile should have the legal Organization Name, a DUNS number, and at least one named IDC Rate with a start date established for the rate.
1. Navigate to Cayuse 424 from SeRA at https://sera.stanford.edu.

2. Select the prime proposal you are developing.

Research Systems,Linking a Cayuse 424 Proposal to a PDRF,"Stanford Electronic Research Administration

Linking a Cayuse 424 Proposal to a PDRF
One can link a Cayuse 424 proposal to a SeRA PDRF to populate the PDRF with information from the Cayuse 424 proposal to reduce duplicative data entry.  A Cayuse 424 proposal can be linked to a PDRF at all stages of a PDRF transaction before completion and for all PDRF types. 
Information* that can be pulled from a Cayuse 424 proposal and pushed to a SeRA PDRF includes:

Sponsor
Key Personnel
Subaward institutions and key personnel
Proposal Start and End Dates
Proposal Title
CFDA #
Opportunity #
Total Request Budget Amount
Human Subjects (Y/N)
Animal Subjects (Y/N)
Human Stem Cells (Y/N)
Will any resources (funding, people, equipment, etc.) be used outside of the United States for this project? (Y/N)

*The extent of information pulled from a Cayuse 424 proposal and populated in SeRA is dependent on the specific application form pages being used by the relative opportunity # and the extent the application form pages have been completed at the time of linking.  If a Cayuse 424 proposal does NOT include the SF 424 RR and/or RR Other Project Information form pages then some project questions may not be populated on the PDRF.  Moreover, If a Cayuse 424 proposal does NOT include the RR Key Persons and/or RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages then some key personnel information, and/or the presence of subawards (as applicable) may not populate on the PDRF. 
Linking a Cayuse 424 Proposal at PDRF Initiation
1. From the Start Transaction screen of a PDRF, select Yes to the question ‘Do you want to link to a Cayuse application?’ A Cayuse Proposal ID field will then display.
2. From within the Cayuse proposal, click the   icon at the top of the page. A Proposal Information window will open which contains a 10 digit Proposal ID. Copy the Proposal ID number, and enter it in the ‘Cayuse Proposal ID’ field in the Start Transaction window in SeRA. Click Start.
3. The Cayuse linking wizard will run, and a series of windows will display to verify the information being pulled from Cayuse 424 and being pushed to the PDRF.  Once the wizard begins you cannot navigate backwards in the wizard.  However, you can click the X in the top right of the wizard window at any time to cancel the wizard from running.
A. Verify Sponsor – Review that the sponsor listed in the ‘Push to PDRF’ column is the correct SeRA Sponsor. If yes, click Next.  If you are starting a Supplement PDRF, or Resubmission PDRF, it will also show what is currently on the PDRF in the ‘PDRF Sponsor’ column. 
Note, a message will display that the sponsor cannot be updated if the PDRF is in a stage where the sponsor field is not editable.          
B. Verify Personnel - Personnel listed on the Cayuse proposal’s RR Key Persons form page that have an associated SUNet ID will show in the Verify Personnel window.  Some roles will default to the associated SeRA PDRF role. For all others, select the role from the drop-down so they can be properly set in SeRA.  Verify the department for each individual is correct and change as needed. De-select the ‘Push to PDRF’ column prior to continuing for any personnel that should not be listed on the PDRF.  Click Next.
Note, if your Cayuse 424 proposal does NOT include the RR Key Persons form page personnel information entered in the Cayuse 424 proposal will not be pulled from Cayuse and pushed into the PDRF.  For these Cayuse 424 proposals you will need to enter the appropriate project personnel in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.
C. Verify Subawards – Any subawards listed on the Cayuse 424 proposal’s RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages will show in the Verify Subawards window. For each subaward institution identified in Cayuse search and select the appropriate subaward institution to be pushed to SeRA. Click Next.
Note, if your Cayuse 424 proposal does NOT include the RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages and/or if these pages are not being utilized in your Cayuse 424 proposal [such as in the case of NIH modular budget proposals] subaward information entered in the Cayuse 424 proposal will not be pulled from Cayuse and pushed into the PDRF.  For these Cayuse 424 proposals you will need to enter the appropriate subaward information in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.
D. Verify Project Info - Additional project information will pull from the Cayuse application and show here. If you are starting a Supplement PDRF or Resubmission PDRF, the window will also show what is currently on the PDRF in the ‘PDRF Data’ column. Click Finish.
Note, for Cayuse 424 proposals that do not include the SF 424 RR and/or RR Other Project Information form pages minimal project information will flow from Cayuse to SeRA.  For these proposals you will need to enter most project information in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.
4. Once the linking wizard is finished you can see, delete, and refresh the Cayuse link on the SeRA PDRF on the Admin & Sponsor Details page. The blue Cayuse 424 Proposal ID # is a direct link to the relative proposal within Cayuse. The presence of the link can also be viewed within Cayuse on both the Proposals List Screen as well as within the relative proposal.
Note, the direct link will only work for those that already have been granted permission to the relative Cayuse 424 proposal and/or have central office Cayuse access.



Refreshing an Existing PDRF Link to a Cayuse 424 Proposal
1. At any point during the PDRF transaction before it is completed the PDRF assignee can on the SeRA PDRF on the Admin & Sponsor Details page click the trash can icon to delete a Cayuse link or click Refresh to refresh the link between the PDRF and the Cayuse application. Clicking Refresh will trigger the linking wizard to run again and will update or notify you to update data elements that have changed since the last time the wizard ran.

A. Verify Sponsor - In this example there is no change in the sponsor. Click Next.
B. Verify Personnel - In this example a new Key Person has been added to the Cayuse 424 proposal. Review, edit the role and department as needed, check or uncheck if this person should be pushed to the PDRF, and click Next.
C. Verify Subawards - In this example there has been no change to the subaward listed on the Cayuse 424 proposal and already on the PDRF.  Thus, we will leave the ‘Push to PDRF’ box unchecked.  Click Next.
Note, if the ‘Push to PDRF’ box were checked in this example the result would be two duplicate UC Berkeley subaward entries on the Budget Questions page of the PDRF.
D. Verify Project Info - In this example the PoP dates, title, total requested budget amount, and animal subjects information has been changed in the Cayuse 424 proposal. The linking wizard identifies where the Cayuse 424 proposal and PDRF are no longer matching and indicates for which fields the PDRF is being system updated and for which fields the PDRF assignee will need to manually update the PDRF or Cayuse. Click Finish and proceed with making any needed manual PDRF and/or Cayuse updates.
Linking a Cayuse 424 Proposal to an Existing PDRF
1. From the Admin & Sponsor Details page of a PDRF select Cayuse 424 as the submission method and click Link Cayuse Application.

2. The Link Cayuse Application window will open.  From within the Cayuse proposal, click the  icon at the top of the page.  A Proposal Information window will open which contains a 10 digit Proposal ID.  Copy the Proposal ID number, and enter it in the ‘Cayuse Proposal ID’ field in the Link Cayuse Application window in SeRA and click Link.


3. The Cayuse linking wizard will run, and a series of windows will display to verify the information being pulled from Cayuse 424, compare it to what is already in the PDRF, and indicate for which fields the PDRF is being system updated and for which fields the PDRF assignee will need to manually update the PDRF or Cayuse. Once the wizard begins you cannot navigate backwards in the wizard. However, you can click the X in the top right of the wizard window at any time to cancel the wizard from running.
A. Verify Sponsor – Review that the sponsor listed in the ‘Push to PDRF’ column is the correct SeRA Sponsor. If yes, click Next.  If no, edit as needed, and click Next.
Note, a message will display that the sponsor cannot be updated if the PDRF is in a stage where the sponsor field is not editable. 
B. Verify Personnel - Personnel listed on the Cayuse proposal’s RR Key Persons form page that have an associated SU Net ID will show in the Verify Personnel window and are compared against key personnel already listed on the PDRF.  For personnel being pulled from Cayuse, some roles will default to the associated SeRA PDRF role. For all others, select the role from the drop-down so they can be properly set in SeRA.  Verify the department for each individual is correct and change as needed. De-select the ‘Push to PDRF’ column prior to continuing for those personnel that should not be listed on the PDRF.  Click Next.
Note, if your Cayuse 424 proposal does not include the RR Key Persons form page personnel information entered in the Cayuse 424 proposal will not be pulled from Cayuse and pushed into the PDRF.  For these Cayuse 424 proposals you will need to enter the appropriate project personnel in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.
C. Verify Subawards – The linking wizard will compare subawards already entered on the PDRF with any subawards listed on the Cayuse 424 proposal’s RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages. For each subaward institution identified in Cayuse that is NOT already on the PDRF search and select the appropriate subaward institution to be pushed to SeRA. In the below example, the subaward already entered on the PDRF is the same one as the one on the Cayuse 424 proposal.  Thus, we will leave the ‘Push to PDRF’ box unchecked. If the ‘Push to PDRF’ box were checked in this example the result would be two duplicate UC Berkeley subaward entries on the Budget Questions page of the PDRF. Click Next.
Note, if your Cayuse 424 proposal does not include the RR Subaward Budget Attachment form pages and/or if these pages are not being utilized in your Cayuse 424 proposal [such as in the case of NIH modular budget proposals] subaward information entered in the Cayuse 424 proposal will not be pulled from Cayuse and pushed into the PDRF.  For these Cayuse 424 proposals you will need to enter the appropriate subaward information in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.D. Verify Project Info - The linking wizard will compare project information already entered on the PDRF with that which is listed on the Cayuse 424 proposal’s SF 424 RR and/or RR Other Project Information form pages, and indicates for which fields the PDRF is being system updated and for which fields the PDRF assignee will need to manually update the PDRF or Cayuse.  In the below example the PoP dates, title, and total requested budget amount in the Cayuse 424 proposal differs from what is in the PDRF.  Click Finish and proceed with making any needed manual PDRF and/or Cayuse updates.Note, for Cayuse 424 proposals that do not include the SF 424 RR and/or RR Other Project Information form pages minimal project information will flow from Cayuse to SeRA.  For these proposals you will need to enter most project information in the PDRF as you would for non-Cayuse 424 proposals.  Additionally, for supplement proposals the linking wizard will never overwrite the PDRF title with the Cayuse title, as the existing title in SeRA takes precedence over supplement submissions.

Cayuse 424 Comprehensive User Guide
Scenario #2: Stanford will be issued a subcontract, the pass through institution does NOT use Cayuse 424, and the proposal is for an opportunity that requires detailed budget pages* from subs.

Option #1: We request that the flow through institution extract the subaward pages of the proposal from Grants.gov Workspace as PDFs, send them to us for completion, we complete them and return them for uploading into their Workspace prime proposal.  For more information about this click here.
Option #2: We provide the pass through institution with the requisite information and attachments for them to complete the subaward pages within their own Grants.gov Workspace prime proposal.

*For federal submissions to opportunities that do NOT require detailed budget pages from subs, it is typically most efficient to provide the PTE the information they need to complete their prime proposal via email.

Research Systems,How to Create and Edit a Cayuse 424 People/Professional Profile,"Stanford Electronic Research Administration

Cayuse 424 – Creating and Editing People Profiles
All Stanford Cayuse 424 users have the ability to create and edit People Profiles within Stanford’s Cayuse 424.  The information entered in an individual's People Profile is populated in a proposal when that individual is selected as personnel (PI or other) on an application.
Note: If a department elects, on behalf of a subrecipient institution, to create and complete in Stanford’s Cayuse 424 a subaward proposal as part of their prime proposal then both an institutional profile will need to be created for the subrecipient institution as well as professional profiles will need to be created for subrecipient key personnel within Stanford’s Cayuse 424.
Creating a people profile for an individual does NOT grant the individual user access to Cayuse 424.  Cayuse 424 user access can be requested by submitting a SeRA HelpSU ticket.
The creating of subrecipient institutional and professional profiles in Stanford’s Cayuse 424 is NOT necessary if the subaward proposal is created at either another Cayuse using institution or subawards.com and sent to Stanford for importing into our Cayuse 424 prime proposal.

A consistent naming strategy is valuable in helping us to maintain an organized environment. Everyone can find the right teams easier, and we’ll avoid unnecessary duplicates.
Microsoft Teams naming prefixes
By starting names with a short prefix, we ensure everyone sees this key information immediately.
In the Stanford University tenant, the names of all Microsoft Teams start with the standard prefix ""SU-Group-” by default.
The prefix is added automatically added to the name when the Team is created. The rest of the Team name needs to be entered manually by the person who is creating the Team.
Naming guidelines for Teams
When creating a new Microsoft Team, please apply the following naming convention:
SU-Group-{Organization or School Name Prefix} {Department/Group}
Examples:
SU-Group-UIT Finance TeamSU-Group-UIT Comms Team
Team names should include something to identify your group or its purpose in the context of the university as a whole. For example, "" Finance Team"" would not be specific enough to differentiate your group from the many other finance teams around the university. ""UIT Finance Team"" would be more helpful.
Teams created with names that don't follow these guidelines may be renamed.
Notes about naming
A space or underscore is allowed between fields within the name.The following special characters are not allowed: ~ "" # % & * : < > ? / \ { | }.Team names cannot exceed 64 characters.Ensure you're using a unique public name when creating the Team."

Audio & Video Conferencing,FAQs: Teams Guest Member Experience,"On this page:
Getting startedUnderstanding guest and tenant accessChatPlanner, Whiteboard, OneDrive, and other M365 apps
Review these FAQs to learn more about how to work with guest members in Teams.
Getting started
Q:Can you elaborate on what cross-affiliate collaboration in Teams means?
Each of the three Stanford Medicine Affiliates maintains and manages its own separate M365 tenant. To share data across Stanford Medicine, each affiliate may invite guests from the other affiliates to join their Teams tenant.
Q: Can PHI/PII be shared in Teams?
PHI (patient medical record information) and PII (staff Human Resources data) will be allowed to be shared for collaboration efforts across Stanford Medicine. Your access to Teams and other Microsoft 365 applications, including Stanford University email, will be limited to devices with a Cardinal Key starting Aug. 31, 2023.

Understanding tenants and guest access
Q: What is a Microsoft tenant?A tenant is an application available to a specific group of users and typically associated with a domain name, such as @stanford.edu or @stanfordhealthcarte.org. In Microsoft, Stanford University, Stanford Health Care, and Stanford Children's Health each maintain their tenant.Q: What does it mean to be a guest? At Stanford University, a guest is someone who doesn’t have a SUNet ID or a Stanford University Microsoft account. The individual becomes a guest once invited to join a team in the Stanford University tenant and accepts the email invitation to activate their guest account. You will be able to collaborate with colleagues in the health systems as guests in the Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children’s Health platforms as well as with collaborators outside of Stanford who have Microsoft Teams available in their institution.Q: What does it mean to be an external user in Teams? External access lets people in other organizations chat and call you. You cannot add a person with external access to a Team unless you add them as a guest.Q: I am in the School of Medicine and see Stanford in my organization picker, but I don't see Stanford Health Care or Children's Health Care in my list. What should I do? To see organizations you may access as a guest in your organization-picker list, you must first receive a chat or an invite to a Teams' team from someone at that organization.  Here’s how it works.
You will receive an email notifying you of a waiting chat message or Teams team invite. To accept the invite, click the link in the email.If you have previously selected ""open these links in Teams, "" Microsoft will redirect you to your desktop Teams client version.Go back to the browser window behind the desktop client window. You should see your guest chat there. If the guest organization does not show up, you may need to log out and log back into Teams. You may have to do this several times. 
Q: I invited a healthcare colleague to be a guest on my team in the Stanford University tenant, but the option to log in as a guest account is missing from their Teams application. What happened? When you invite a collaborator to be a guest member in the Stanford University tenant, Microsoft will email them an invite if they have not worked in the tenant before. The collaborator must accept the invite to switch to their guest account. Learn more about working with external guests.
If the guest member accepts the invite but doesn’t see the option to switch tenants when they click on their profile in the upper right corner, they may need to restart their computers and attempt to accept the invite again.If the recipient misses the invite, they will not be added to the team as a guest. You will not receive feedback that the chat or Teams team site invite has not been accepted. The best solution is to ask your collaborator to check their inbox and accept the invite.If the collaborator has accepted the invite but does not see the option to switch to their guest account, ask them to restart their computer and accept the invite again.
Q: Is the presence indicator tenant-specific?Yes, the presence indicator is tenant-specific. Wherever you see someone’s profile, such as tagging them in a channel thread or trying to chat with them, you’ll see if they are online in your tenant. If they’re not online in your tenant and you need to reach them quickly, it may be best to message the external user outside of Teams.Q: How does a guest know what Microsoft tenant they are in? They should see the tenant selected in the upper right in the organization picker. A tenant is an application available to a specific group of users and typically associated with an organization and domain name, such as @stanford.edu or @stanfordhealthcarte.org. Learn more about the guest experience.Q: Some of my collaborators have both a SUNet ID and a hospital ID. Should I add them to my Team as full members (SUNet ID) or guests (hospital ID)? You can discuss this with your collaborators to determine the best answer. If your collaborators spend most of their time in the SHC or SCH tenants, they may prefer to be added as guests. But adding them as full members will make the experience more feature-rich. Q: Why do I see two entries for a colleague outside of Stanford University? You may see two entries for a user you've chatted with who has also been invited into a team at Stanford University as a guest. Choosing the (External) user may be the best way to chat or call with that individual since the guest member may not be signed into the Stanford University tenant. The guest member option may be better if the guest must participate in team meetings, document sharing, and extended multi-person team channel conversations. Q: How do I know if I’m adding a Stanford University member or a guest member to my Team?In the Stanford University tenant, (SHC)(Guest) or (SCH)(Guest) will appear after the names of those with an active hospital affiliation in the Team’s directory.Q: Can I invite someone outside of the Stanford university or health systems domains to be a guest in the Stanford University tenant?Anyone at the university can invite a guest user from any domain. (i.e. @gmail.com) Once that user accepts the invite, they could then be added to a Teams team as a guest. The difference is that everyone at SHC and SCH already has a guest account created for them in the university tenant.
Chat
Q: When I send a chat message in Teams, will guest members receive a notification? When you send a chat message in Teams, notifications are sent to everyone working in the tenant — including guests. However, no message will be displayed for guests not currently active in the tenant. What guests do get is the same as if they missed a notification in their account: an email summarizing that a notification is waiting for them that arrives about an hour later. They also get a notification waiting for them in their Activity tab the next time they manually log in to the relevant account. However, knowing that guest members will only see a chat when they are signed into the Stanford University tenant, it may be best to limit conversations to file collaborations and non-urgent matters.Q: Someone sent me a chat in Teams, but I didn’t see any notification for it and missed their message.   How can I prevent this from happening again?There are a few ways you can help to ensure you won’t miss chat messages.
Be sure you have notifications turned on. Go to your profile icon in the top right corner (your initials in a circle) and select More options (three dots). Select settings, then privacy. In the Windows and Mac desktop applications for Teams, notifications are not shown for messages from another organization’s Microsoft 365 tenant, so you can use a browser window or the mobile app for Teams. For the mobile app on your iPhone, the notifications from all guests at Teams in other organization locations will show an alert, although there may be a delay. You may go into settings in the Teams app on your phone to turn the sound on or off for Teams notifications. For a browser window, open in a supported browser and navigate to Teams.office.com and sign in if required. Once the Teams app is open, go to your name icon (circle with your initials) in the top right corner and select the guest organization from the drop-down list. Use the incognito window. If you want an additional organization’s guest windows to open, you may use a private incognito window. (Note that is impossible for SHC users due to Conditional Access sign-in requirements).
Q: Is there any easy way for guest members to work in their home tenant but still be available to join group chats across tenants? Chatting as a guest requires you to switch your view to the guest account. When you switch tenants in your main desktop app, you can no longer see chats and data in your home tenant. As a workaround, many people keep a browser or mobile app open in the other tenant while keeping the desktop app open in their home tenant. Then they can participate in both at the same time.Q: I received an email saying that I have a chat from someone at a different organization, but when I click the link, it takes me to my own organization’s Teams chats. What should I do? When you click a link to open a chat or file in Teams, it will try to open the correct file or chat but defaults to opening Teams from the organization where you last authenticated. For example, if you last chatted with someone from SHC, Teams will open to SHC Teams. Here’s what you can do to find the message or file you want: Use the organization picker (by clicking your profile icon in the upper right corner) and select the organization (tenant) where the message originated. (For example, if you receive an email notification from an SMCH colleague, Stanford Children's Health (Guest)). Once you have switched tenants, click the link in the email notification or select the activity bell at the top left corner of the Teams screen.Q: How do I add someone from Stanford Medicine to a team or chat if I don't see the name I am looking in the Teams directory? Stanford University members may choose to have their name to be hidden from the Teams directory (Global Address List). You can add their name by entering the person's full email address, i.e., janestanford@stanford.edu.Q: How do I start a chat with an external user if I don’t see their name in the directory? Start a new chat, and enter the external user’s full email address. You will see an option to “search externally” for the user. Once the user is found, you can chat, call and see the external user’s availability (presence) information. Learn more about working with external guests.Q: How do I add someone external to Stanford to a team? Open the Teams' team, then select ""add member"" in the three dots next to the name of the Teams' team at the top of the channel names list on the left.  Enter the person's full email address. For example, ""Jane@Duke.org"" The recipient will receive an email from Microsoft with a link to access the Teams' team at Stanford. Learn more about working with external guests. Learn more about how to add members to a team.
Planner, Whiteboard, OneDrive, and other M365 apps
Q: I want to add a guess from another organization to my Microsoft Whiteboard, but I can't find their names in the drop down ""people picker"" list.  What is the issue? Microsoft has not enabled Whiteboard for cross-organization collaboration. However, you can use the app for whiteboarding activities across the School of Medicine or use the Whiteboard in a meeting while showing your screen.Q: I do not see the ""+"" symbol to add an application (Planner, Wiki Notes, SharePoint Lists, etc.) to a Teams' team channel. Why is that? Only team owners can add applications and change the configuration of a Teams team.Q: I shared a Word document from my OneDrive to a guest at another Stanford Medicine organization. Why is he being required to sign into Teams each time he want to open the file? You can avoid this issue by granting access. This option ensures that only the individual you specify will be added to a list of people with direct access to the file and avoids the known issue requiring Stanford Medicine Affiliates to re-login to M365 after clicking a shareable link for file sharing in Teams. Here's how:
Click the More option (three dots) next to the document in the document library view (list of documents) and select ""Manage access"" from the menu of options.Click the blue ""+"" symbol to the right of ""Direct access.""Select the guest's name from the drop-down list or enter the guest's full email address.  When you are done, click “Grant access.”
Q: I am a guest in a Teams' team hosted at SHC. My SHC colleagues can edit a file in the document library but I cannot. What should I do?SHC has sharing policies for documents automatically matched with PHI or PII data and labeled as ""High Risk."" Stanford Medicine users can view but not edit the files. You may ask one of the team members from SHC to change the file label to ""Secure"" so that you may edit the file. ​Tip: If the team has a mixed membership of Stanford Medicine guests and guests from other organizations, it is best practice to move documents into a private channel only accessible by guests from organizations trusted for collaborating with PHI."

General questions about the Microsoft 365General questions about the Teams platformMaking Teams work for youFiles and file storageTroubleshooting common issues in TeamsDisabling automatic Teams meeting links
Below is a list of common questions about Microsoft Teams. General questions about the Microsoft 365Q: What is M365? Is it the same as Office? Office 365 (O365) has become Microsoft 365 (M365) a cloud-powered platform that includes a suite of desktop, web, and mobile apps and services for collaboration and productivity.Q: How do Teams, OneDrive, Teams, and SharePoint work together?SharePoint is Microsoft's online storage platform. Every SharePoint site has its library of documents. SharePoint is also the backbone for OneDrive and Teams. OneDrive is essentially a personal SharePoint site. Every Teams site is also a SharePoint site. Think of Teams as an interface or “wrapping” that sits over SharePoint to combine SharePoint's file storage with other features like chat.General questions about the Teams platformQ: What are Teams? Teams are collections of people, content, and tools that center around different projects and jobs within an organization.  Q: What is a channel? Channels let individuals on a Team have conversations about specific topics. Every team has its own set of channels. Except for guests, any team member can create a new channel. Each channel belonging to a team is completely public to all the team members and guests, so everyone can feel free to join in a channel conversation. However, it is possible to create a private channel.Q: How do I know if I should create a new team or channel? If your new project involves working with all the same people who are in your current Team, it might be best to create a new channel instead. If you need a private space for a certain group, you can create a private channel and invite only those people. Often, it's more effective to create a new channel rather than creating an entirely new team. However, if you need a more robust workspace beyond the capabilities of a channel, you can create an entirely new team workspace and invite new team members.Q: Is there a naming convention for Teams? While there is no formal convention, we encourage you to follow Stanford University's naming policy. Adopting a consistent naming approach helps ensure others can easily understand who owns your team and its purpose.Q: What’s the difference between team channels and private chats? While channel conversations are public, chats are just between you and someone else (or a group).Q: Can I collaborate in the Teams platform if I’m not on a Team? Microsoft Teams can be used without a Team for direct messaging, video, and voice calling. Anyone at Stanford University with a full-service or sponsored full-service SUNet ID can request a Microsoft Teams team to collaborate with a group of people.Q: How is Teams different than Slack or Zoom? You can use these tools to chat, call, or videoconference. Slack and Zoom are the university’s preferred collaboration tools, but Teams is a good option for certain use cases. Teams can be used for cross-affiliate collaboration, such as with individuals in the hospitals and clinics. Q: What is the difference between the role of owner and member of a team? Owner and member are the two user roles within Microsoft Teams. The user who creates a new team is granted owner status by default. When interacting with a team and its channels, owners and members have different permissions and capabilities.Q: How do I know which conversations include me? If you're worried about knowing when someone in a conversation needs your attention, keep an eye on your Activity feed. You'll get a notification whenever someone:
	@mentions you@mentions teams and channels you belong toReplies to conversations you're part ofReplies to your replies
	Making Teams work for youQ: Can I view my stanford.edu or stanfordhealthcare.org email accounts from the Teams interface? Unfortunately, there is no direct access to email accounts. The email app requires webmail or an email client like Outlook.Q: How do I change my notifications so messages don’t pop up on my screen during meetings? You can manage notifications by clicking the more actions (three dots) in the top right and selecting Settings>Notifications. For more info, refer to Manage notifications in Teams.Q: How do I add someone to a private chat? To loop someone into a private conversation, click the Add people icon in the upper right corner of your screen. Enter the name of the person you’d like to add and select Enter.Q: Where do I find my recordings? Depending upon the type of meeting, there are multiple places to share. To learn more, visit How to play and share a meeting recording.Q: How do I share a meeting recording with individuals who didn’t participate in the meeting? If you recorded or organized the meeting, you can share it with people who weren't invited to the meeting—by sharing it like you would share any other file. Just find the file in OneDrive or SharePoint and share it directly with people or copy a link and share it however you like. If you weren't the person who recorded or organized the meeting, you could still share the recording with people who weren't invited. However, the meeting organizer or the meeting recorder must approve your share action before those people get access.Q: Can I add a colleague with a healthcare ID to my team? Yes, employees of Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children’s Health are identified in the university’s Team’s directory as (Guests). See the Teams Guest Experience to learn more.Q: The initials in my Teams profile aren't displaying how I'd like. Do I have the option to edit the initials I want to use? The initials of the Teams profile are based on your user display name and cannot be modified. However, you do have the option to upload a new profile image if you'd like. (You can always upload an image of your preferred initials as your profile photo.)Q: How do I easily find my most commonly used contacts and chats? You can pin up to 15 contacts or chats to make them easy to find. Here’s how: Find the favorite contact or chat in recent chats, hover over the name, and click More options (three dots). Select the pin option, and they’ll appear in a pinned list at the top of your chats.Q: In Teams, where do I find the files and folders I upload to a channel or share in a chat?Each team has its own site in SharePoint. The same files and folders can be accessed from either Teams or SharePoint. Files you upload to a channel are stored in your team's SharePoint folder. These files are available in the Files tab at the top of each channel in Teams. Files you upload to a one-on-one or group chat are stored in your OneDrive and shared only with the people in that conversation. These are available in the Files tab at the top of a chat.Q:How do I easily search for files and other information shared in Teams? There are several ways to find what you need in Teams. When you type a word or name, Teams will show related results. Choose one of the suggested items or press Enter for a full list. You can also press Ctrl+F (cmd+F on macOS) to search messages within a particular chat or channel in Teams. Choose the area you want to search—for example, a recent chat or the General channel within a team. Press Ctrl+F followed by your search terms, and then press Enter. The search results will be displayed from within that chat or channel conversation. Refer to Search for messages and more in Teams. Files and file storageQ: Where are the files I add to a channel stored? The backend site for a Team is a SharePoint site. Files you upload to a channel are stored in your team's SharePoint folder. These files are available in the Files tab at the top of each channel.Q: Where are the files I upload to chat stored? The backend site for a Chat is OneDrive. When you add files to a one-on-one Chat, your file is stored in your OneDrive and shared only with those in that conversation. Q: Where do I upload files to be shared with my team? If you have any structured file format for your Teams, it’s better to avoid uploading files to chats. Doing this will cause files to appear at the bottom of the general Files tab instead of in their proper folder. (Loose files can still be moved to the correct folder location afterward, but it’s an extra step) 
	Instead, go into Teams > Files, find the correct folder (or create one), and upload the file. You can then select Copy link to share the file in chat or channel conversations.  
	Q: How do I share my files to OneDrive or SharePoint?
	If you are working on the file by yourself, save it to OneDrive. Your OneDrive files are private to you unless you share them with others.  If you’re working as a team, you should save your files where your team works. 
	Troubleshooting common issues in TeamsQ: I found a colleague at SHC in the Teams directory and sent them a chat. However, they didn’t receive it. How come? You cannot send a chat to a colleague in another tenant unless that person has accepted the chat or been added to a Team.Q: How do I join a Teams meeting from Safari? By default, you cannot join a Teams meeting from Safari, but by changing the settings, you should be able to. You must download the Microsoft Teams app in advance to join the meeting via mobile device.Q: I can no longer access a folder in Teams. What could be the issue? It’s possible that the file or folder name was changed in SharePoint. Remember, any SharePoint file name or location changes must also be changed in Teams.

Audio & Video Conferencing,Guest Member Experience in Teams,"On this page:
Stanford Affiliate colleagues are guestsJoining a team as a guestActivating the guest experienceTroubleshooting the guest experienceIdentifying guest members on a teamCapabilities comparisonLearn more
The guest experience in Microsoft Teams allows you to add individuals from outside your organization or affiliation to your Teams channels, enabling them to collaborate with your internal team members on projects and tasks. With that, you can use Teams to connect with colleagues from Stanford Health Care (SHC) and Stanford Medicine Children’s Health (SMCH) with similar ease as when collaborating within the university. This includes participating in chats and using SharePoint.
To learn more about the guest experience, review the guest experience FAQs.
Stanford Affiliate colleagues are guests

 
Guest members are those invited to join a team or channel in Teams from outside the organization or tenant. Stanford Affiliate colleagues are considered guests in the Stanford University tenant.  This is because the university, SHC, and SMCH each have coordinated but separately managed Microsoft tenants. If you are unfamiliar with the term “tenant,” think of it as a dedicated piece of the cloud that Microsoft provides to an organization to hold its data and other information.  Similarly, if you are invited to join a team in the SHC or SMCH tenant, you will collaborate as a guest.
To review the definition of tenant and other Microsoft terminology, refer to UIT’s Teams glossary.
Joining a Teams team as a guest
All Stanford Medicine Teams users will have one home tenant and automatically have guest access to the other Stanford Medicine tenants. To see Teams tenants from other organizations you can access as a guest, you must first receive an invite to a Teams team or an invite to join a chat from someone at the organization.
When you are invited to join a team or a chat outside of your home tenant for the first time, you will receive an email notification email message from Microsoft.You can accept the invitation by clicking the link in the email. Once you sign into Teams using your home credentials, you will be directed to the Teams team's page in the guest tenant to view and access content, be added to channels within the team, and communicate with other team members.

Activating the guest experience
When people become guests on a team, they will see their guest account in the organization picker when they click their profile picture/initial icon in the top right corner of the Teams client or Teams on the web.  The picker lists all organizations to which the individual has a guest account plus their home tenant — and lets them toggle between different organizations.   
Changing an organization will enable the individual to activate the guest experience as a guest member in another tenant. 

Troubleshooting the guest experience
If you are trying to join a Microsoft Teams guest tenant using an invite link and the link does not take you to a new tenant, try this:
Sign out of your Teams account. Sign out of your Microsoft account and then sign back in. Allow time for the guest tenant to appear. It may take up to 24 hours to see the guest tenant appear in the organizational picker.Retry the process. You may need to repeat these steps more than once. 
Identifying guest members on a team
All team members see a message in the channel thread announcing the team has a guest member. A (Guest) label appears next to the name of each guest member, and a tag in the upper-right corner of the channel thread indicates the number of guests on the team.


Capabilities comparison
Guest members don’t have all the capabilities of those with a SUNet ID — but they have access to team chats, meetings, documents, and files shared within certain team channels. However, to access those files or chat conversations, guests must enable the guest experience by being logged into the Stanford University tenant.
Refer to the table below to see how the capabilities compare.

Audio & Video Conferencing,How do I join a Zoom meeting from a video conferencing system? (Legacy),"In most conference rooms, Zoom is already programmed into the room system as a Favorite. While room panel systems vary, follow a process similar to the following to join a Zoom meeting:

From a video conferencing panel, find where the Zoom or Zoom Conferencing option is saved on the system. It is likely under Contacts or Call.
From the list of Favorites, touch the Zoom option.
From the Zoom dialog box, touch Call.The room system will dial into Zoom.
On the screen, touch Keypad.The keypad will appear.
On the keypad, type # meeting ID number #.

Troubleshooting
You might receive an error message when attempting to join a meeting from a conference room.
This message indicates that the room system is not encrypted thus you will not be able to join the Zoom meeting using that room system.
To protect Stanford data, including video content, Stanford Zoom requires that all devices participating in a Zoom video conference have encryption turned on. That’s automatic for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, but not always true of room systems.
If you encounter any problems connecting to a room system, contact your local IT support for help setting up encryption on the system. Alternatively, you can use Stanford's WebEx service to connect to that room."
Audio & Video Conferencing,Zoom Tips and Tricks,"Scheduling in Zoom

Set up a Personal Meeting ID (PMI): Like BlueJeans, Zoom lets you set up a Personal Meeting ID that lets you have a meeting without scheduling it in advance. For information, see the Zoom Help Center: Schedule with Personal Meeting ID (PMI).
Create recurring meetings: To create a new series of recurring meetings in Zoom, go to Schedule a Meeting and check the Recurring meeting box. You can then customize your occurrences. Add the new recurring meeting information to your calendar invitations.
Use the Zoom Outlook plugin: Zoom's Microsoft Outlook plugin lets you schedule your Zoom meetings directly in your Outlook calendar. For more information, see the Zoom Help Center: How to Use the Microsoft Outlook Plugin.
Assign a different person as the meeting host: The alternative host function lets you schedule a meeting and assign another person as a host. This function is only available when you schedule a meeting through the web portal (stanford.zoom.us).
Schedule a meeting for another person: To schedule a meeting on someone else's behalf, see the Zoom Help Center: What is Scheduling Privilege?
Schedule concurrent meetings: A single host can schedule up to five concurrent meetings as long as they do not use their Personal Meeting ID (PMI) to schedule the meetings.

Using room systems

Join Zoom from a room system: Follow these steps to join a Zoom meeting from a room system.
Encrypt room systems: Stanford Zoom requires that all devices participating in a Zoom video conference have encryption turned on. That’s automatic for desktops, laptops, and mobile devices, but not always true for room systems. If Zoom participants use a non-UIT supported room system, it is best to test the connection before the meeting. If you have trouble connecting to a room system, contact your local IT support for help setting up encryption on the system, or use Stanford's WebEx service when connecting to that room.

If you notice latency in your video conferencing calls, please check your home WiFi bandwidth before assuming the problem is related to Zoom.
To check your bandwidth, follow these steps:

While in the Zoom call, click the caret (^) next to the Start/Stop Video button.
Select Video Settings...
When a new window appears, select Statistics.
Review the following information:

Check the Overall bandwidth. Normally it should be within 750kbps+. Note: Bandwidth is a dynamic number, and if there is a less motion a lower bandwidth is normal.
Check the Audio to ensure that it is less than 1% packet loss.
Check the Video to ensure that it is less than 1% packet loss.



If you have a bandwidth issue that is affecting your Zoom call, try these steps:

Leave the meeting then rejoin it.
Reboot your computer.
Reboot your WiFi router.
Try to join the meeting from your mobile device on a cellular network, rather than WiFi.
Turn video off or change your profile to a static photo. Learn how to customize your profile in Zoom.
Have Zoom call your cell phone for audio.

For more tips on managing bandwidth, visit How to Access Applications and Services Faster When You Work from Home.

Audio & Video Conferencing,Add Features When Creating Zoom Meetings in Canvas,"The Canvas-Zoom integration has a subset of features available in the Zoom app or portal. Meetings can be created in Canvas, then edited in the Zoom app or portal (https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting). Those settings or features will apply when the Zoom meeting is started, even if they don’t show up in the meeting’s edit screen within Canvas."
Audio & Video Conferencing,How to Stop Canvas Notification Spamming for Recurring Zoom Meetings,"Issue: Every time I create or edit a recurring meeting, my students get spammed with notifications for every meeting occurrence.
Solution: It is best to unpublish the Canvas course before creating or editing recurring meetings. When a Canvas course is unpublished, no notifications will be sent out. As long as students have not yet submitted assignments, you can temporarily unpublish the Canvas course to make edits, then republish.
Try to make these edits before the course starts or early on in the quarter, before students start submitting work. If it is too late for that, and students are complaining of too much email, another option is to let students know they can change the Calendar notification to a reduced frequency or turn it off under Account > Notifications."
Audio & Video Conferencing,How to Join a Zoom Meeting by Phone,"Changes to how you join a Zoom meeting by phone
On April 16, 2020, UIT changed a default Zoom setting to further protect your meetings from unwanted participants. If you add a numeric password to your meeting, participants joining by phone must enter that same password (if you edit your password to make it alphanumeric, a numeric version will be autogenerated for your meeting invite*).
Participants who join the meeting via app but want to join the audio by phone should select the Call Me option to avoid entering the Zoom phone number, meeting number, or password as they would have to if they dialed in (This option is called Call My Phone on mobile app). Participants who need to join exclusively by phone will need an Outlook invite sent to them.
Canvas Users Note:

Clicking the meeting link you find in the Canvas Calendar, or Zoom tool, will launch the app on your desktop or phone and log you in with an embedded password. You can join internet audio, however, if your phone signal is better the Call Me method will help participants avoid the need to type in the password if they’ve successfully connected to the meeting.
If students can’t connect to the meeting to begin with, instructors will need to share the Stanford call in number and meeting password because the Canvas Zoom tool doesn’t display the Zoom phone numbers and password for meetings to students. It only displays a meeting number and link to connect to meetings with an embedded password in the URL.

As long as it is numeric, the phone password is the same as the meeting password the host sees as they create or edit a meeting in Zoom.
However, if the password was edited to include non-numeric characters, you can only find the numeric phone password by clicking the meeting at https://stanford.zoom.us/meeting and opening the Outlook invite.

Telecommunications Systems,Finesse Frequently Asked Questions,"Why do I seem to randomly get logged out of Finesse?
For optimal performance, and to avoid being logged out of Finesse inadvertently, UIT recommends being hard wired onto the internet and manually turning off your wireless internet.  




Why can't I log into Finesse?
Ensure you are logged in to Jabber or your desk phone, before you log in to Finesse. If trouble still persists, you may have forgotten to sign out of another device. Finesse only allows your user id to be logged in to one device at a time. 




Can Finesse automatically place us in a Not Ready state when making an outbound call?
The UIT Team is exploring this possibility and will provide a response after thorough testing on this function. 




Can I save my password for Finesse in the program?
Due to security policies, you are unable to save your password in Finesse. Depending on your browser, prompts may be different, you can store your password and then only have to enter your extension to log in. 




Where does the clock in Finesse pull the time from?
The time in Finesse is pulled from a dedicated server for the phone system. The time that that you log in to the system will be automatically recorded by the server. The time that you log in is not impacted by the clock on your laptop. 




Can we add contacts to the phone book in Finesse?
To add a contact to the Finesse phone book, your supervisor will need to submit a ticket to the UIT Service Desk. Phone books in Finesse are shared by teams, so any changes to a phone book will be visible to the whole team and as such, should be applicable to the whole team. For individual extensions or personal contacts you may add contacts thru the ""Contacts"" feature in Jabber. 




If I am using the Consult feature in Finesse and retrieve one line, will it automatically put the other line on hold?
Yes. While using the consult feature in Finesse users have the ability to alternate between two calls. When on an active call, retrieving the call on hold will automatically place your other call on hold. 




What do I do if I can't log into Finesse at the start of my shift to record my time at the start of the day?
First, email your supervisor to inform them you are here and unable to log in. For help resolving this technical issue, contact the UIT Service Desk. 




Will I be able to switch between using Finesse and my desk phone on a call?
We recommend that you use Finesse for all call management however, you may choose to use your desk phone to answer a call , place a call on hold or perform a transfer. NOTE: You must be logged into Finesse with your desk phone extension in order to use the phone for contact center call activities. 




How will I get notification of a new incoming call through Finesse? What if I don't have the window up-will there be a pop-up?
If you are using Finesse with a desk phone, you will not see a pop-up, but your desk phone or headset will ring. If you are using Finesse with a desk phone, Jabber extension, there will be a pop-up window in Jabber when you receive a call. You will also hear a ringing on your headset. 




Will I be able to see my call log in Finesse?
Call logs are not visible in Finesse, however, call logs are available in Jabber and on your desk phone. 




What do I do if I am on a call in Finesse and I accidentally close my browser window?
If you are on a call and accidentally close your browser, you will remain on the call, but will have to use Jabber or your desk phone, as applicable, for further call control activities. When done with the call, log back in to Finesse as soon as possible. 




Where do I manage my current state (e.g. ready, not ready, etc...)? Can I manage it thru both my desk phone and Finesse?
All contact center state management is supported thru Finesse. You must be logged into Finesse to take calls. You will no longer use your desk phone to log in/out and manage your state in queue. 


How can I save time when doing warm transfers?
When you are on the phone with the caller and you know that you will be transferring them, go ahead and press the ""Consult"" button in Finesse while you are still talking to them. This will bring up the keypad and you can then enter the phone number you want to transfer to and when you are ready to place the caller on ""hold"" and transfer them, simply select the ""Call"" button. This eliminates having 10 seconds of dead air before the hold music plays/transfer begins. REMEMBER - You can only make an outbound call from a ""Not Ready"" state. Select ""Not Ready-Outbound Call"" when placing an outbound call. REMEMBER - When you receive a direct call on your desk phone, change your status in Finesse to ""Not Ready"" so that you don't also receive a queue call. 




Is there a recommended way to make a Warm Transfer?
When you are on the phone with a caller and you know you will be transferring them, go ahead and hit the consult button in Finesse while you are still talking to them. This will bring up the keypad and you can then enter the phone number where you wish to connect them. When you are ready, place the caller on hold by hitting the call button. This eliminates having 10 seconds of dead air before the hold music begins. 




I can't see my Finesse phone book. Is there anything I can do?
You can switch between ""Home"" and ""Manage Calls"" from the Home page. If you are on the Home tab, switch to the Manage Calls tab by clicking ""Manage Calls"". If you are on the Manage Calls tab, switch to the Home tab by clicking ""Home"".  




Any quick ways to make calls, conference or transfer calls from Finesse?
If accessing a database to look up someone's number to place a call, you can copy the number from that database and paste the number into Finesse, using normal Windows commands. REMEMBER: Follow normal Stanford dialing instructions to reach a contact outside of Stanford."

Help & Ticketing Systems,How Do I Find a Person's Assignment Group(s) in ServiceNow?,"It is best practice to assign a ticket to an assignment group rather than an individual in ServiceNow. However, there are times when there is a legitimate reason to assign it directly to a person. There are a few different ways to find out someone's assignment group.
From the Informational ""I"" within a ticket

Within a ticket, enter the person's name in the Assigned to field.
Click the informational ""i"" button near the person's name.
When the user information displays, right click on ""Open Record"" and choose to open the record in a new tab.
From within the user record, scroll to the bottom and click on the ""Groups"" tab. This tab will show all the ServiceNow groups the person is a member of. 
Once you have identified the appropriate group, go back to the browser with the ticket and populate it in the ""Assignment Group"" field. 

From the Global Search

Type in the person's name in the global search field in the top right hand corner near your name.
On the right section of the UI, click the ""People - Users"" section and select the correct user to display their user record.
From within the user record, scroll to the bottom and click on the ""Groups"" tab. This tab will show all the ServiceNow groups the person is a member of. 
Once you have identified the appropriate group, go back to the browser with the ticket and populate it in the ""Assignment group"" field."

Help & Ticketing Systems,Calling all ServiceNow Group Managers — Save a License,"As a shared service used across Stanford, ServiceNow is offered to all campus units to help manage their community’s support requests. University IT funds the maintenance, support and enhancements to the platform as well as a pool of named licenses for the entire campus to share. ServiceNow charges Stanford every year for every license that is assigned to a person, even if the license is not being actively used. To be good stewards of Stanford’s resources, we are calling all service group managers to review your licenses and look for opportunities to make a license available to another community member.
How can you help?
As a first step, we’re asking ServiceNow Group Managers to self-audit and ensure all users in their group need to view and manage tickets in the system. If someone has moved to a new role where they don’t need to work on ServiceNow tickets, if you remove them from your group, you will save a license for another member of the Stanford community to use. To learn how to verify your group members in ServiceNow, you can view this quick article."
Help & Ticketing Systems,Best Practices for Fulfilling ServiceNow Incidents and Requests,"Best practices exist to deliver a consistent experience to end users and to increase workgroup efficiency. Although Incidents require more urgent resolution than Requests, they both share common best practices.
Use the Appropriate Ticket Type
When submitting a ticket on behalf of someone, or for yourself as a fulliller, use the appropriate ticket type. This keeps metrics accurate to facilitate continuous improvement and as mentioned above, the expected completion times vary.

Incidents (records prefaced with INC) - Incidents should be used to report IT related issues such as a broken computer, trouble accessing an application, etc. Incidents are to be resolved as quickly as possible since they can be preventing users from completing their work.
Requests (records prefaced with REQ, RITM or TASK) - Requests are currently used by IT groups. They are submitted to request something such as a new computer, password reset, etc. Upon submission, three records are generated, a Request (REQ), Request Item (RITM) and Catalog Task (TASK). Request forms, that sit within a catalog, are comprised of variables/fields to collect necessary information used to fulfill a request. Requests use predefined workflows to facilitate or automate tasks, for example approvals.
Support Request (records prefaced with SR) - Support Requests are used by Non-IT groups, however, it is also available to IT groups for ad hoc tasks. They have the same look and feel as Requests within the catalog and also use variables/fields to collect necessary information from end users for fulfillment. Compared to normal Requests, they do not have multiple records that generate upon submission. On the back-end, fulfilling a Support Request looks similar to an Incident and is resolved in a similar manner.

Ensure Accurate Contact Information is Listed
When logging a new ticket on behalf of someone else, if they are a Stanford affiliate, adding their name in the Reported by or Requested by field will automatically populate their email and phone number listed in the Stanford directory. Stanford affiliates may have multiple user accounts or, there could be multiple users with the same name. You should make sure to validate the correct Stanford account by verifying the SUNet ID displayed next to their name. If the user information is not populating from the directory, that means their account is either marked private or doesn't exist yet in the directory, in which case, they should be entered in as a guest. Ensure the phone number and email address listed is correct. 
Tip: The Reported by/Requested by, by default, will receive ServiceNow email notifications when a comment is added in the additional comments. Use the Watch List if you want the emails to go to additional individuals as well.  
Designate a Coordinator/Queue Manager
Designating a coordinator/queue manager helps ensure tickets are on the radar of staff available to fulfill them. They can assign tickets based on individual availability and facilitate the quick movement of misrouted tickets.  
Add a Work Note When Transferring a Ticket
If you need to transfer a ticket to a different group, add a work note with an explanation for the transfer. This will also help the receiving group determine if they should facilitate some corrective actions to ensure proper routing of their future tickets. 
Assign New Tickets to a Group, Not an Individual
If you are transferring a ticket (after typing a helpful Work Note - see above) assign it to a group, not an individual. That will reduce the risk of assigning the ticket to someone who is unavailable. The only exception should be when a fulfiller explicitly asks you to assign the ticket to them. 
Assign Ticket Ownership
Coordinators or Queue Managers should review incoming tickets and assign them to an individual to avoid multiple group members working on the same ticket. 
Adjust the State or Status
Adjusting the state or status of a ticket is a quick way for others to know what the status is of a ticket. For example, “Work in Progress” indicates that someone is actively working on a ticket whereas “Awaiting User Info” indicates some pending action is needed from the end user. 
Provide Frequent Updates
To track the activity on a ticket, updates are highly recommended. Status updates to the end users helps them understand that their ticket is being actively worked. 

Additional comments - Use this field for end user updates and communications
Work notes - Use this field to post the activities done on this ticket

Resolve the Ticket
It is always best to confirm with the end user that you have fulfilled their Request or resolved their Incident to their satisfaction.
In some cases, fulfillers reach out to the customer for clarifying information on several occasions with no response. UIT has a policy that allows fulfillers to resolve a ticket if the end user fails to respond after three attempts over a two-week period. This is based on the assumption that the end user no longer needs assistance.
Enter meaningful close notes when closing out a ticket so the end user knows what action was taken to fulfill their Incident or Request.
The three different ticket types have different resolution to closure times:

Requests automatically auto close upon fulfillment
Support Requests auto close 30 business days upon resolution*
Incidents auto close 5 business days after resolution*

*During this time, end users have the ability to re-open their ticket by indicating their issue has not been resolved on the resolution email they receive.  
Share Information
During the fulfillment of a ticket, if there is knowledge gained that can be leveraged in the future, create a knowledge article. 
Leverage Reports
Several reports exist in ServiceNow to help manage group’s activities.View this knowledge article for common and useful reports."
Help & Ticketing Systems,Support Request Now Available for IT Fulfillers,"Support Requests are now available for IT fulfillers in addition to non-IT groups to use for request management. This additional functionality will help fulfillers request an action by another fulfiller unrelated to an incident, problem, request or change. 
Highlights of Support Request:

Child tasks can be created off of a Support Request so multiple teams can be involved in the fulfillment process.
Integration with JIRA system to create CR's.
Incidents can be triggered from a Support Request.
Support requests can be triggered off a Call.
Business-focused services can be selected, separating the business function from the technical service offering. This is especially helpful for those teams who provide value-added services unrelated to the underlying technical systems.
Secure Support Requests are completely hidden away from non-secured groups and their members. This is a slightly different model from the current implementation of Incidents where a minimal set of fields are visible to all fulfillers on secure tickets.
Support Requests are closed 30 business days after resolution. This time frame is longer than how Incidents are handled today where the gap between Closed and Resolved is 5 business days.
Once a Support Request is closed, it cannot be re-opened. A new Support Request would have to be opened to attend to any outstanding tasks.
Assignment group signatures can be added to email notifications.

To get started with Support Request, check out the Quick Start Guide for IT fulfillers."
Help & Ticketing Systems,What is the difference between a Service Owner and a Service Manager?,"Many have wondered what the difference is between a Service Owner and a Service Manager.  While here at Stanford, we often have the same person play both roles, according to ITIL, these two roles are quite distinct.
Service Owner: Service owners focus on the big picture - service planning, development and improvement. They are NOT engaged in the day-to-day management of the service. Service owners are accountable for the quality, delivery, and technology of a particular service, with primary responsibility for the service and technology roadmap and the strategic direction.  Services owners are typically a Director or Manager and play a strategic role.
Service Manager: Service managers focus on the day-to-day management of the service. They are responsible for ensuring the implementation and management of the service roadmap and lifecycle, as established by the Service Owner.  Services Managers are typically a Technical Manager and play a more tactical role.
For a full list of responsibilities, check out Confluence."
Help & Ticketing Systems,How to Get a ServiceNow Direct Link (PCAT) for a Service,"Direct links or ""PCATS"" can be extracted from ServiceNow to ensure that incidents and requests are ""directly"" assigned to the proper fulfillment group. They can be published on webpages, embedded in applications or distributed to clients in any fashion that is available to them to get quick support.
For Incidents

Go to ServiceNow at https://stanford.service-now.com/ 
In the left-hand navigation, expand Business Services and click Service Offerings.
Use the search located at the top of the form to locate the service name. 
Right-click on the service name and select Copy URL to Clipboard.
Paste the copied link in a text editor and then copy only the service offering ID (everything after the equal sign).

For example, the service offering ID for Subversion is 1cd7c11a1374e20063eadf82e144b079


Use the following link and paste the service offering ID (copied in the previous step) to form the PCat link for that service.

https://stanford.service-now.com/services?id=get_help&cmdb_ci= <Service Offering ID>



For example, the Pcat link for Subversion is https://stanford.service-now.com/services?id=get_help&cmdb_ci=1cd7c11a1374e20063eadf82e144b079
To check that you generated the link correctly, click on the URL and validate that the service offering name populated in the ""You are submitting a ticket related to"" section.

Help & Ticketing Systems,ServiceNow Inbound Web Services API,"ServiceNow supports a variety of inbound Web Services that enable developers to easily integrate other applications with ServiceNow. These web services use REST, SOAP, EXCEL and services with more specific functionality like PDF and RSS.
RESTful web services offer several advantages, including:
Support for different HTTP methods to perform different actionsDetailed response codes and header informationPagination support for large data setsStreaming data on GET requestsUse of display values to present data in a user-understandable form
In ServiceNow, there is concept of display values and actual values. The actual value represents the raw value in the database, whereas the display value represents the value that is usually shown in the UI. For some fields, there are significant differences in how these values display in the UI vs. in the database.  Examples:
Reference fields: The database value is sys_id, but the display value is a display field of a referenced record.Data fields: The database value is in UTC format, while the display value is based on the user's time zone.Choice fields: The database value may be a number, but the display value will be more descriptive.


To maintain the security and the integrity of the data in ServiceNow, as well as system performance, we will be using the “Scripted REST API” to build web service APIs. This feature will allow our ServiceNow developers to perform complex operations on multiple records by having control of the API code.
Process to create a new Scripted REST API
Following are the steps to request, develop, test and migrate to production a new Scripted REST API.
Submit a ServiceNow Request using the Create a ServiceNow Scripted REST API form. API Requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and it is important for you to provide as much information as possible so that we can better support your request. We will review your request for completeness, potential impact on system performance, the extent to which your solution will survive ServiceNow upgrades, and possible exposure to High Risk Data. Please allow three to five business days for the review of your request.Include the following in your request:
Business needDescription and usage of the API (describe whether the API will be used by an application or user/command line). Please state if you currently use a similar Remedy API.HTTP Method (POST, GET, PATCH, PUT)ServiceNow Table (incident, sc_task, sc_request)Request format to use (application/json, application/xml)List of the request/query parameters Note: A list of the available fields/parameters can be found at the ServiceNow Data Dictionary. You can also find a list of the possible values for the Choice FieldsResponse format to use (application/json, application/xml)List of response parametersNote: A list of the available fields/parameters can be found at the ServiceNow Data Dictionary. You can also find a list of the possible values for the Choice FieldsData Security 
Risk level of the data to be accessed (ServiceNow secure tickets/secure groups)Security measures that will be used for end-user accessFor a system to system integration, indicate the web service security standard(s) that can be supported by your system (i.e. Basic Auth, OAuth, etc)
Usage Details
Audience type (external, internal, both)Approximate number of usersApproximate Requests/DayPeak usage timingApproximate Peak Timing requests/minute

If your request is approved for implementation, the development team will develop a Scripted REST API in the ServiceNow DEV instance. You will be responsible for developing the API code for the application that will receive the ServiceNow API response. Code snippets for various programming languages are included in the examples below:Example ServiceNow Scripted REST API: /getincidentsExample ServiceNow Scripted REST API: /getincidentdetails You will be provided with:
A Web Services account (user/password)Note: This account requires a ServiceNow fulfiller/ITIL license in PRD. Your team will be responsible to protect and maintain the security of the Web Services account password. To request a password change, please submit a ""Modify a Scripted REST API"" form (see below).A REST API URI (name_space, api_id, resource_path)REST endpoint type ACLs to define access controlsAPI request parameters specification 
After you have successfully validated the API functionality in the DEV instance, the development team will migrate the code to the TEST instance where you will be responsible to complete the User Acceptance Testing.We will coordinate the API migration to the PRD instance.
Note: You will be responsible to test the API functionality during or after ServiceNow patch and release updates. We will send notifications when the schedules for such updates are known.
Process to modify/delete a Scripted REST API
Following are the steps to request, develop, test and migrate to production changes to an existing Scripted REST API. 
Submit a ServiceNow Request using the Modify or Delete a ServiceNow Scripted REST API form. API Requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and it is important for you to provide as much information as possible so that we can better support your request. We will review your request for completeness, potential impact on system performance, the extent to which your solution will survive ServiceNow upgrades, and possible exposure to High Risk Data. Please allow three to five business days for the review of your request. Include the following in your request: 
Name of the API to be modifiedReason(s) for modificationModification details
The development team will make the needed modification in the DEV instance.After you have successfully validated the API functionality in the DEV instance, the development team will migrate the code to the TEST instance where you will be responsible to complete the User Acceptance Testing.We will coordinate the modified API migration to the PRD instance."

Help & Ticketing Systems,Why Do My ServiceNow Records Look Different?,"If you log in to ServiceNow and notice that your view looks different than it normally does (i.e., key fields are missing from a form), there are a few things that can be the cause. The most common reason is the 'Default View' is not set. Another reason is the 'Tabbed forms' tab has been switched on or off.
Default View
The 'Default View' is the view that fulfillers normally see and are accustomed to when logging in.
How do I know what view I'm in?
If you are in a view other than the default, next to the record number, there will be some text. The example below shows that this record is being viewed in the Self Service view.  

How do I get my view back to the Default View?
Within a ticket
In order to get back to your normal view, do the following:

Within the ticket, navigate to the hamburger button in the top left corner near the ticket number and click on it.
Click 'View' in the pick list.
Select 'Default view'.



From a list

If you are on a list, for example, you are viewing all tickets assigned to you, navigate to the hamburger button in the top left corner.
Select Change View.
Another window will pop up from which you want to select 'Default view'.



Tabbed Forms Turned Off
The 'Tabbed form' setting presents related data within a ticket in a tabbed form. There is an option to turn this off so that the information displays in one long continuous list. 
If that option gets turned off and you want to turn it back on, here is how:

Navigate to your system settings by clicking on the gear icon in the top right hand corner near your name

Help & Ticketing Systems,"Why does UIT IT Operations Center (ITOC) take ownership of Major Incident, P1 and P2, Tickets?","The Major Incident process exists to facilitate the restoration of services due to a service outage or degradation. There are tasks that happen behind the scenes to make sure the appropriate people are notified of issues as they arise and that the community is properly alerted and updated.
What is a Major Incident?
A “Major Incident” is defined as a widespread, serious, major interruption or outage of a critical service that must be resolved with great urgency. They are classified as P1 and P2 Incident tickets. The aim of the Major Incident Process is to quickly restore service with any means necessary, including workarounds.
How does it get routed?
When an Incident is declared as a P1 or P2, it routes to the UIT IT Operations Center (ITOC). They take responsibility and ownership of the Incident until it is resolved.
Why does it route to ITOC?
ITOC is staffed 24x7. They have operating procedures to validate the legitimacy and magnitude of an Incident. They maintain contact information for Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) so they know who to call and how to pull together the appropriate people to work an issue. After pulling together the appropriate people, they have a process to find out what is going on and when service might be restored so they can relay that information back to the community.
What does ITOC do with a Major Incident? 
Once a Major Incident is declared, ITOC validates the legitimacy of the Incident. They reach out to the appropriate SMEs and generate an Incident Task (INCT), from a parent Incident. That Incident Task is then used to gather updates from the SMEs on their investigation and remediation efforts. That information is then communicated to the Stanford community via communication channels such as Slack, bridges and the Services & Support portal.
The entire process can be viewed here."

Security Tools,File Storage Security,"University IT employs an automated tool to scan file storage systems for broadly exposed files that appear to contain High Risk Data. As a precaution, permissions are tightened on identified files to prevent undue exposure.  
File owners are notified of the change via email and can restore the file sharing permissions as needed.

Change file sharing permissions

If you receive an email that a publicly accessible link was removed from one of your files by the automated tool, you might need to reshare the file so that collaborators can access the file again. You can update sharing permissions for file by following the steps below:

Search for the file name on the file sharing platform where it’s stored. The email includes both the file name and platform.
Review the file sharing permissions for the file.  If you discover sensitive data that may have been publicly exposed or shared with an unauthorized audience, promptly report it to the Privacy Office.

Security Tools,File Storage Security FAQs,"What is the goal of the File Storage Security Program?
The file storage security program was established to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data across all major university file storage systems by proactively identifying and remediating unduly exposed files, implementing automated protection mechanisms, and archiving unneeded data.
What file storage systems are being scanned?
Currently Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, AFS, and select departmental Windows file servers are being scanned by the automated tool.
What data does the automated tool identify as High Risk?
The automated tool searches for patterns indicative of sensitive data such as Social Security Numbers, credit card numbers, medical record numbers, and bank account numbers.
How do I prevent my files from being scanned in the future?
All broadly shared files are scanned (i.e., those shared with 100 or more individuals). To prevent your file from being scanned, reduce the access permissions of your files to the minimum number of people that need to collaborate on the file.
Are people reading through my private files?
The automated tool is only scanning the contents of broadly shared files (i.e., those shared with 100 or more individuals). Manual inspection is only performed when necessary, such as part of an investigation."
Security Tools,Preparing a personally owned computer to meet School of Medicine (SoM) Data Security Compliance requirements,"The School of Medicine (SoM) requires that any computer used for Stanford work, even to check email, must be encrypted. It is recommended that before encrypting a computer that the data are backed up and all updates to the operating system have been completed.
Policy
IT support staff will not provide direct hands-on hardware and software support for personally owned computer equipment regardless of the physical location of the equipment. IRT staff can consult or guide the client as they navigate their own computer. IT support staff are not responsible for adding or removing software required by Stanford to meet University or SoM data security requirements on personally owned devices. However, staff should offer instructions/guidance, direct users to appropriate websites, answer questions, suggest tools, etc.
IRT support technicians will be happy to offer instructions/guidance to assist you at any step of the following process but you have to “do the driving” and navigate your own system with the technician's guidance. We cannot guarantee that the upgrade process will go as planned; there can be unexpected failures with hardware or software. Some 3rd-party software may need to be reinstalled, updated, or a newer version may need to be purchased to work with the new operating system.
Backing up your data

Back up your personally owned computer data to an external hard drive. These are relatively inexpensive even for a large capacity. For example, a Western Digital 1TB Portable External Hard Drive - USB 3.0 sells for $55 from Amazon.
For Mac computers, use the built in Time Machine backup capability.
For Windows computers, use the built in backup utility for Windows 7 and 8; also for Windows 10.
To backup and restore using Windows 10.
The SoM provides CrashPlan as a backup utility for Windows and Mac.

Updating and upgrading your operating system (OS)

Update your current operating system (OS) with the latest patches and updates.
More information on upgrading and updating Mac computers can be found through the App Store. Apply patches to the current OS before upgrading to the higher OS.
Checking for updates on Windows computers can be done from the Start menu on the computer. Check with IRT if you have questions.
For Windows computers, you may need to purchase/obtain the latest operating system. If you already have Windows 10 Professional, then no purchase is needed.

Cloud Network,"Using NetDB to point a Stanford Name to a Cloud IP number (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure)","There are three ways to point your [name].stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford (“cloud”) service provider:
1: Via an “A record,” or ""AAAA Record"" (called the “name” in NetDB), where you point your stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford IP number. This will be explained in this article.2: Via a CNAME, where you have your stanford.edu name as an alias, or CNAME, to a non-Stanford name, which is explained in Using NetDB to point a Stanford CNAME to a Cloud DNS Name.3: Via a delegated domain, which will is explained in Using NetDB to delegate Stanford domains.
For AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, you may be asked to make an A or AAAA record that points a stanford.edu name to one of their IP numbers specifically. If you are working with a different hosting provider that wants to use an A/AAAA record, the following instructions still apply.
This article will explain how to connect your stanford.edu hostname to an AWS, GCP or Azure IP number, and what to do if you can't assign the IP number that you've been asked to assign.
NetDB cannot contain the entirety of the world's IP numbers, so if you need a non-Stanford IP range, it will have to be defined. It would add unnecessary load to the NetDB database to automatically add all IP ranges from AWS, GCP and Azure, so we will only add those ranges as requested. If you get an error that the IP range you want to use is not in NetDB, please put in a ticket with the IP range that you need to use and, most importantly, the NetDB group(s) that need rights to that IP range.
Within NetDB, the IP ranges are defined in these network entries:

Amazon-AWS-Net
google-cloud
azure-cloud

You can do a ""quick search"" and choose the ""network"" option to see them. There are a few others smaller cloud vendors (Vercel, Linode, etc.) with IP ranges in NetDB.
Within those network entries are many IP ranges. For each IP range, a specific list of NetDB groups are given rights to use those IP numbers. Here is one example from the azure-cloud network entry:
addr space: 13.96.0.0/13 lo: 0 hi: 0group: Amazon-Web-Services, cloud-platform
That IP range is huge, and contains all the IP numbers from 13.96.0.0 through 13.103.255.255. It may be difficult to determine if the IP address you've been assigned is in NetDB if the second octet doesn't match one that's defined in the network entry.
Use this tool to determine what the super-net IP range is for your assigned IP number: https://whois.arin.net/ui/
The search box is a tiny box in the upper right.
For example, if you were told to use 40.80.90.100, you would get the following result:

The ""net range"" at the top let's you look for the CIDR blocks listed below. It tells you that the Net Range that contains 40.80.90.100 starts with 40.74, so look below and see ""40.74.0.0/15"". From within NetDB, enter ""40.74.0.0/15"" into the quick search box and select ""Networks"" as the record type, and you'll see the single result of ""azure-cloud"" which tells you that the IP range is, in fact, defined.
Clicking on the ""azure-cloud"" result in NetDB lets you see all the IP ranges that are defined in NetDB. You'll notice most of those 40.* IP ranges are not defined, as we have not been asked to define them. If you need one defined, please put in a ticket listing the IP range in CIDR format and the NetDB group(s) that need to be able to assign IP numbers in that range. If you're not sure about the CIDR range, UIT Networking will look that up and use it.
You'll also see that the only NetDB groups with permission to assign IP numbers in 40.74.0.0/15 are: Amazon-Web-Services, cloud-platform, Enterprise Technology. If your NetDB account doesn't have one of those groups, please put in a ticket letting us know which group that you're a member of should be added to that IP range.
To summarize:

You can point your stanford.edu host name to an AWS, GCP or Azure IP number (or one of many other non-Stanford IP numbers)
There's a good chance the IP range you want to use may not be defined.
There's a chance that the IP range is defined, but none of the NetDB groups to which you belong can use that range

If you need an IP range defined or modified, please enter a NetDB ticket: https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9ec7c49613bce2008a9175c36144b03e"
Cloud Network,Using NetDB to point a Stanford CNAME to a Cloud DNS Name,"Please note: This is an article about DNS, not URLs. The following is a URL:
https://museum.stanford.edu/programs/
This article will only discuss the DNS part, which is in yellow, and how an organization could have that particular Stanford.EDU node name point to a non-Stanford node name. All the parts that in red are the URL, and are beyond the scope of this document.
Local Network Administrators are encouraged to create and maintain their own “cloud” DNS records in NetDB if there is no conflict with other organizations. If you do not have NetDB access, please pass this article to your local support so that they may create the record that you need. You can find your Local Network Administrator here: https://web.stanford.edu/group/networking/dist/sunet.reports/LNA.html
There are three ways to point your [name].stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford (“cloud”) service provider:
1: Via a CNAME, where you have your stanford.edu name as an alias, or CNAME, to a non-Stanford name, which is explained here.
2: Via an “A record,” (called the “name” in NetDB), where you point your stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford IP number. See Using NetDB to point a Stanford Name to a Cloud IP number (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure) for details.
3: Via a delegated domain, which is explained in Using NetDB to delegate Stanford domains.
If you are using Squarespace, they use CNAME records but have some special requirements. Please see Squarespace DNS Redirect Instructions for instructions.
A CNAME, or Canonical Name, (referred to in NetDB as an “alias”) is a name that points to another name. DNS needs an IP number, so eventually there needs to be an “A record,” which is a name pointing to an IP number, but that “A record” doesn’t need to be served by Stanford’s DNS. In the above example, museum.stanford.edu is an alias (CNAME) for live-cantor-arts.pantheonsite.io, and the A Record is maintained by Pantheon, not Stanford.
Using a CNAME has a few advantages:
• If your service provider changes IP numbers, you don’t need to make any changes.
• You may be able to have a unique NetDB entry that is not shared with other organizations, even if all of those entries end up pointing to the same IP number.
The primary disadvantage of using a CNAME is that a CNAME can never be shared with an MX or TXT record. If you already have an MX record (used for email) or a TXT record (often used for site verification), you may not use a CNAME. This is an absolute rule of DNS, and there’s no way around it. You may still use an “A record” to point your stanford.edu name to another organization’s IP number if you have an MX or TXT record.
If you are working with a service provider (such as Pantheon, Weebly, Fastly, Acquia, Wix, etc.), they may request that you make a [your-name].Stanford.EDU CNAME pointing to their “A record” (or node name). If you use an automated wizard, it will almost never check to see if there is an existing MX or TXT record, so it may give you an impossible and prohibited request. You will need to contact your service provider to resolve that conflict, or find a different provider.
To check yourself, if you are not familiar with the “host” or “dig” commands, you may use this tool from Google: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/
Enter your desired fully qualified domain name (i.e.: your-site-name.stanford.edu) and then click on the MX button, and again on the TXT button. If you see “Record not found!” for both buttons, you’re OK, and may proceed with creating the CNAME/alias record. Do not trust that your web hosting provider will do these simple checks for you.
 
Once you have confirmed that you do not have a conflict with MX or TXT records, you might be able to make that entry yourself in NetDB. To do so, you need to check the following.
•Does the non-Stanford domain exist in NetDB? If not, you may request that it be added, and make sure you let us know the NetDB Group(s) that need to be able to make names within that domain.
•Do you share a NetDB group with the “create names in” list for that domain in NetDB? If not, you need to request that your group(s) be added to the “create names in” list for that domain. “All Groups” access does not work for “Create Names In” for domains.
 
In NetDB, from the “Full Search” pull-down, choose “Domain.” Search for the subdomain in which you’ve been asked to make a record. For example, if you’ve been asked to point your-site-name.stanford.edu to your-site.name.stanford.edu.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com, do a NetDB Full Search…Domain for stanford.edu.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com and then look to see if one of the groups that you’re a member of is listed under “Create names in (Groups).”
It’s possible that, like Squarespace, your provider will ask that you point your CNAME to a global name shared by many aliases. In that case, you can put in a ticket to ask that UIT Networking add your CNAME to the list.
If you need to have a domain created or modified so you can use it, or need to share an existing record, you can use this shortcut: https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9ec7c49613bce2008a9175c36144b03e
 
Once you have the rights to create this record in NetDB, please do the following:
For “Name” put the Fully Qualified Domain Name that your provider has given. This will be in your provider's domain, this is not the stanford.edu name. In the above example, it's live-cantor-arts.pantheonsite.io.
Add one alias, and put your *.stanford.edu name there. This would be museum.stanford.edu in our example.
You will probably want to check the “virtual” checkbox for your own searches and reports.
For location, “Cyberspace,” “Amazon Web Services,” “Google Cloud Platform,” and “Azure Cloud Computing” are all pre-defined. Please use one of those instead of a random building.
For Make/Model, “Amazon AWS,” “Google GCP,” ”Microsoft Azure,” and “virtual webserver” are already defined and appropriate.
For Operating System, ""virtual"" is appropriate.
You don’t need to enter an IP number. Any IP number you enter won’t work anyway, as NetDB will see that the *.stanford.edu name points to a non-Stanford name, so NetDB won’t send any IP numbers to DNS."
Cloud Network,Q&As About Cloud Solutions,"Review these questions and answers to learn about University IT's cloud strategy and transition of the StanfordWho directory to the cloud.
About UIT’s Cloud Strategy
Why are cloud solutions essential to the university?
Cloud-sourced software products offer the best solutions and range of options available in the marketplace — with rapidly improving capabilities, use of advanced technologies, and robust hosting services.
It’s desirable for UIT to migrate applications and IT infrastructure to the cloud for numerous reasons, which are detailed on this UIT Cloud Transformation webpage and summarized here:
Campus space is at a premiumService improvements are continuousCloud computing resources can easily scale up and down, as necessaryTime to provision computing resources is expected to be quickEarthquake danger is real, and cloud services provide geo-diversity
What is UIT’s overall strategy with cloud providers?
UIT is continuously looking for smart ways to leverage innovative cloud solutions that can benefit the university.
In calendar year 2019, we will migrate UIT systems from our Livermore data center to the cloud, selecting scalable, cost-efficient, innovative, and resilient solutions that further enable the Stanford community. Once these migrations are complete, we will focus on systems in our on-campus data center, using the experience and expertise gained from the Livermore migrations.
While we acknowledge some critical systems will need to remain on campus, our priority is to achieve geodiversity using the cloud.
How does UIT currently leverage cloud providers?
UIT currently leverages cloud providers for robust solutions, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Google, ServiceNow, Zoom, Slack, and many others. These include infrastructure, platform, and software-as-a-service solutions.
What processes are in place to safeguard Stanford data that is shared with cloud providers?
Cloud providers are required to be at least as rigorous as Stanford is with regard to data privacy, and those expectations are always included in our contractual agreements with such providers.
Before any agreement is made, we carefully vet potential cloud vendors through a number of processes, including security and data privacy reviews that vary in rigor depending on the risk classification of the data we plan to share.
Additionally, UIT partners closely with the university’s Privacy and Procurement Offices to consummate contracts related to sharing Stanford data with cloud providers.
More information about security policies related to cloud solutions can be found on the security page of the UIT Cloud Transformation website.
About the StanfordWho Transition
What changed?
StanfordWho, formally known as Stanford People and Organization Search, is the web application that allows you to search the Stanford directory of faculty, staff, students, and sponsored affiliates at Stanford University and the Stanford hospitals to view contact and organization information.
Almost 20 years old, StanfordWho was built by Stanford’s then central IT business unit. It was introduced to the Stanford community as a robust web-based people and organization search application.
In July 2018, UIT began partnering with a cloud provider called Rimeto to create a more scalable, cost-efficient, secure, and resilient underlying infrastructure for the university's directory solution. 
The change was announced in this UIT news article. With the change, the login-protected Stanford and Affiliates view was delivered using this new infrastructure, while the Public view continued to use the original interface.
In June 2019, UIT also moved the Public view to the new infrastructure to create a richer and more consistent user experience. The change was announced in this UIT news article. 
In December 2021, UIT moved StanfordWho to a new platform due to a required transition to a new vendor called Axero Solutions. The change was announced in this UIT news article, and details about the interface changes are described on StanfordWho service pages. 
Why is UIT making this change?
The StanfordWho directory transition to the cloud is part of UIT’s overall strategy to migrate most of its service portfolio to cloud-based products or cloud deployments. Learn more about UIT’s cloud strategy in the answer above.
What are the benefits of the new cloud solution?
UIT selected this solution to provide a more modern display and new features and functionality to what was a 20-year-old homegrown directory system.
Enhancements include:
Visibility into your role and department in the organization. You will see associated departments and staff roles for anyone you look up in the directory. The ability to search the Stanford directory by keyword topics. This allows you to search for Stanford colleagues by area of work or specialty.Visible Stanford Profiles (Community Academic Profiles, or CAP) photos. For those who do not have a visible Stanford Profile photo, you will see a Stanford stock image.Simpler searches across directories. You can begin a search for a colleague in the updated Public view and continue it in the Stanford and Affiliates view without re-entering the name.Visual consistency. The design of the Public view looks like the restricted Stanford and Affiliates view, providing more visual consistency across StanfordWho.
Additional enhancements will be rolled out over time, including changes that the cloud provider may introduce.
What options do I have with my personal data?
The transition of StanfordWho to the cloud has not changed any of your options with your personal data. You continue to have the same options as you have in the past, including whether to list your personal data in the public or Stanford-only view.
You can edit your profile on your own profile page. Select “Edit your directory information” to go to StanfordYou where you can manage your privacy and visibility settings for your directory information. To verify or change your current visibility settings, from your profile page, select “Edit your directory information,” then select “Maintain your directory and AlertSU emergency contact information.” From the right sidebar, select your privacy and visibility preferences.
Note: StanfordYou is the application where you enter and change your own directory information. StanfordWho is the application that displays directory information to the public and/or Stanford community, depending on each individual’s settings.
You now also have the option to include a photo on your profile page in StanfordWho. If you’d like your photo to appear in the directory, you can add your photo to Stanford Profiles (Community Academic Profiles, or CAP), and it will be pulled into your StanfordWho profile.
Learn more about the changes to the profile interface on the  Stanford and Affiliates view webpage or the Public view webpage. For help with how to maintain your directory information on StanfordYou, visit the StanfordYou Help page."
Cloud Network,Cloud Network Definitions,"Private Internet Addresses
Private Internet network addressing at Stanford is defined by standards maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and documented in RFC1918.
RFC1918 specifies the ability for Stanford University - and any other organization - to allocate IP addresses that permit full network connectivity between all hosts within the organization’s network using these addresses as well as any public Internet address allocated for use within the organization only. At Stanford, this means that hosts with RFC1918 addresses can connect to any public Stanford IP address, but not (directly) with any public IPs outside Stanford’s IP space.
Private address allocations at Stanford University must be locally unique within Stanford University networks but are not globally unique.
RFC1918 defines the following network address blocks as private (non-internet routable) addresses:
10.0.0.0/8 (10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255)
172.16.0.0/12 (172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255)
192.168.0.0/24 (192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255)
Stanford University networks do not currently have a support plan for Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses defined by RFC4193 which can be considered IPv6 analogous to IPv4 private Internet network addressing. 
Public Internet Addresses
Stanford University public Internet network addresses are blocks of addresses allocated by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) that are globally unique. These addresses can provide full network connectivity between any hosts using public addresses globally. These addresses can also provide full network connectivity between hosts at Stanford University using public addresses and any hosts using private addresses at Stanford University only.
The Stanford University public Internet address blocks are:
IPv4:
68.65.160.0/20 (68.65.160.0 – 68.65.175.255)
128.12.0.0/16 (128.12.0.0 – 128.12.255.255)
171.64.0.0/14 (171.64.0.0 – 171.67.255.255)
204.63.224.0/21 (204.63.224.0 - 204.63.231.255)


IPv6:
2607:f6d0::/32 (2607:f6d0:0:0:0:0:0:0 - 2607:f6d0:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff)
FQDN Firewall Policies
Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) may be used for either inbound or outbound firewall policies but should only be used when static Internet addresses cannot be used. Stanford University firewalls have a limit in the number of FQDN address objects that can be configured. There will be a time lag of up to an hour between when a service has changed Internet addresses and the firewalls update their FQDN object Internet address mappings."

Cloud Network,Using NetDB to delegate Stanford domains,"There are 3 ways to point your [name].stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford (“cloud”) service provider:
1: Via a delegated domain (using Amazon's Route 53 service, or Google Domains, or similar services), which is explained here.
2: Via an “A record,” (called the “name” in NetDB), where you point your stanford.edu name to a non-Stanford IP number. See Using NetDB to point a Stanford Name to a Cloud IP number (AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure) for details.
3: Via a CNAME, where you have your stanford.edu name as an alias, or CNAME, to a non-Stanford name, which is explained in Using NetDB to point a Stanford CNAME to a Cloud DNS Name.

Stanford’s DNS Zone is “Stanford.EDU,” which means that Stanford’s DNS servers are in charge of almost every host and subdomain within Stanford.EDU. Domain delegation fills in the “almost” qualifier of the previous sentence. By delegating a domain, you are announcing to the world that the name servers for that particular stanford.edu subdomain are not the normal Stanford name servers. You may delegate that subdomain to a cloud provider, such as AWS Route 53, or to other Stanford name servers that your organization maintains.
If you choose to delegate your subdomain, NetDB will no longer be the source for DNS for your domain. You will have to use whatever tools your provider has. UIT Networking can offer no support for your delegated domain.
Advantages of a delegated domain:
• Survivability should there be problems with Stanford’s network (alertsu.stanford.edu and police.stanford.edu are delegated for this purpose).
• A shorter or longer DNS refresh rate than Stanford’s 30 minute DNS refresh rate.
• Complete control over your DNS.
Disadvantages of a delegated domain:
• Complete responsibility for your DNS.
• NetDB will not feed your DNS, but can be used for record keeping.
If you already have any TXT, MX or CNAME records for the name that you want to use as your subdomain, those need to be deleted first before the domain can be delegated. You can recreate them with your DNS provider afterwards.
To delegate a domain, please send a NetDB ticket with the following link:
https://stanford.service-now.com/it_services?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=9ec7c49613bce2008a9175c36144b03e
Please include (in text form only, no screen captures please):
• The domain name.
• The name servers.
• Your administrative contact, preferably with a NetDB Admin Team.
You may still want to point regular Stanford.EDU names as aliases to names within your delegated subdomain. That is handled with NetDB, just like any “cloud” domain, by specifying the correct group(s) that need to “Create Names In” that domain. If that’s needed, please include that in your request."

University IT provides support for a softphone through the Jabber application, allowing you to simulate your Stanford telephone using your Mac.
The Jabber softphone feature is also available for Windows computers, and iOS and Android mobile devices.

Something to consider before getting started
The audio quality of a softphone connection — both what you hear and what the other person hears — is impacted by the microphone and speakers you are using. While most modern computers come with built-in microphones and speakers, you might want to invest in a high-quality headset to improve the audio quality. A headset can also reduce surrounding noise and increase privacy. Headset recommendations.

TYPING THE TELEPHONE NUMBER 
Type the person’s phone number in the Jabber hub Search or call field.Important: When entering a non-Stanford number, you must enter a 9 first, then the rest of the number as you would from a telephone (e.g., 916509871234). With Stanford telephone numbers, you can dial the last five digits or the full seven or ten digit number. Click the green phone icon next to the Search or call field.The call is placed to the entered telephone number.
Receive a call

So, for example, if your forward your desk phone to voicemail, your softphone is also forwarded to voicemail and you will not receive calls. Changing the setting on one also changes the setting on the other.
When you receive an incoming call, you’ll see a call window open on your computer screen.
Click Accept to accept the call.Click Decline to forward the call to voicemail.

Financial Systems,Converged Communication Charges for SoM,"Introduction
University IT bills a monthly lump-sum amount to the School of Medicine (SoM) for converged communications. Then the Dean’s office allocates the charges down to the individual units or departments based on a FTE model as stated below. SoM departments with questions about their converged communications charges should contact Lora Pertle (lpertle@stanford.edu) at SoM Finance.
SoM Finance Explanation
On 9/1/2012, the SoM implemented a telecommunications rate for distributing the desktop phone service costs back to individual units/departments. This was in response to the University’s announcement that they would no longer bill desktop phone services directly to individual depts/units through monthly detailed statements. Instead, the desktop phone service is now charged in a single lump sum to a SoM Dean’s Office fund and the SoM distributes the desktop phone service costs back to individual units/departments through the charging of the telecommunication rate.
The Interdept Conv Comm/Technology fee has been set at 3.0% for FY16 and applies against all salary paid by fund sources (tasks) organizationally coded to the School (except federal sponsored funding and service center PTAs). This rate pays UIT for desktop phone services previously directly paid by your units, and helps contribute towards funding the costs of wired and wireless networking, web site infrastructure, oversight and management as well as a portion of central desktop support.
*Application to Sponsored Projects
The telecommunication charge applies to non-federal/non-government sponsored projects administered through the School of Medicine only. RMG will calculate the 3% rate on all salaries (i.e. faculty, staff, postdocs, and students, and TBN positions) listed on the proposal budget and then enter the amount as a line item in the Other Expenses category as a Telecommunications Charge."

Financial Systems,How to Clear Billable Charges from a Default Clearing Account,"Follow these three steps to clear University IT (UIT) billable charges from your organization's default clearing account and update a PTA.
Step 1: Open the UIT Billing Dashboard to review the charges posted to your clearing PTA
Search the UIT Billing Dashboard by your clearing PTA.
For instructions on how to navigate the UIT Billing Dashboard, refer to How to Locate Services by Billing Account.You will need the Request Reporting role in Authority Manager for your university org to view your billing data.  Refer to How to Request Authority for Ordering and Reporting for more information.
Determine a new valid PTA for each service.
The expired PTA for each service will show under the Reporting PTA field.

Step 2: Submit a Help request to update your services to a new valid PTA
Submit a Help request to UIT Revenue Operations to prevent future charges from posting to the clearing PTA.
Step 3: Submit iJournals to move charges out of your clearing PTA to a new valid PTA
UIT charges are identified by ""Expenditure Transaction Source Long Name"" = ""ITSWO-Feeder - ITS Enterprise Asset Management"" in the OBI Consolidated Expenditure Reports.Refer to Fingate Topic Overview: Accounts Payable (AP) Default PTAs for additional instructions.
FAQs
What happens to charges for UIT services that fail to process due to an expired PTA?Beginning with April 2021 billing, charges for UIT services that fail to process due to expired PTAs will post to the default clearing account associated with that organization. UIT will use the Accounts Payable (AP) Default PTA for the default clearing account. This new process mirrors the one already being used for payroll and accounts payable invoice transactions that do not have a valid PTA. Here's what you can expect:
Task managers of an expiring PTA and the associated default clearing account will begin receiving alerts 45 days before the PTA is due to expire.If the billing account isn’t updated to a valid PTA, charges for the UIT service will post to the default clearing account after the existing PTA expires.Information on charges posted to the default account can be viewed in the UIT Billing Dashboard. Someone on the finance team will need to clear any charges in the default clearing account and update future billing to a valid PTA.
Why did UIT change the process for expired PTAs?As you know, PTAs can expire over time, causing services to go unbilled. Today, if your PTA expires, a UIT staff member contacts someone in your organization to obtain a valid PTA and update the information in the system. However, this manual tracking effort can result in a backlog of billing exceptions and even the possibility of disconnection of services.How do I update a PTA or cost center for a UIT service?If you have access to OrderIT for your departmental organization, refer to How to Update a Billing Account for instructions."

Financial Systems,How to Request Authority for Ordering and Reporting,"Authority to UIT ordering and reporting systems, such as OrderIT, ServiceNow, UIT Billing Dashboard, or OBIEE, is managed through a web application called Authority Manager that is the central location to grant system privileges to staff in the Stanford community. In order to use the application, an active SUNet ID is required. Individual departments are able to manage authority for themselves by providing grantable privileges to whomever they decide. For more information on Authority Manager, please visit What is Authority Manager. Additionally, the University will have their authority cascading. Instead of having to provide authority to each individual org, granting authority to an org will now grant authority to all the lower orgs that roll up to it.
*For SHC and SCH Hospital Cost Center access, please submit a help ticket here.
As services are transitioned to ServiceNow, anyone with a SUNet ID will be able to submit a request for new services, but depending on their level of authority, their request will either be routed for approval or be auto-approved.  Separate authority is needed for viewing requests, approving requests and viewing billing reports or dashboards.
The roles are broken down as follows:
Requester: Anyone with a SUNet IDRequest Viewer: Has the same authority as ‘Requester’ but can also view and submit Change or Cancel requests to any org or cost center they have authority overRequest Approver: Has the same authority as ‘Request Viewer’ but can also approve requests, and their own requests will be auto-approved for any org or cost center they have authority over. Request Reporting: Can view and run UIT billing reports
Below is a chart that breaks down each role and the privileges included.  Please note that if any of the roles also have the grantable privilege, they can grant or revoke authority for their department for that role.

Desktop & Device Support,Print Device Disposal Guidelines,"Why used print devices are a security risk
Multifunctional Devices (MFDs), copiers, scanners, printers, fax machines and other devices may contain hard drives or other media that store data such as images of pages that have been copied, printed or faxed. The data stored on these devices may contain legally sensitive information, including but not limited to personal identifying information or protected health information. The stored data on these devices, in unencrypted form, is highly susceptible to being hacked or retrieved by unauthorized methods. The devices require proper handling through Stanford Surplus, which will manage disposal in adherence to University guidelines, including wiping the hard drives clean of all data.
How to dispose of print devices and toner owned by a department
Follow these steps if your department needs to dispose of a print device (including MFDs, copiers, scanners, fax machines, and desktop printers) or excess toner drums and cartridges (new or used):

Contact your Department Property Administrator (DPA); your local DPA can be found in the DPA Directory.Note: Departments cannot sell, donate or transfer equipment to individuals or non-Stanford entities. The disposal process is handled by Stanford Surplus. For more information, see the Stanford Administrative Guide Section 5.2.4, Surplus Property Sales.
If the print device your department owns has a current service or maintenance agreement that must be cancelled, follow the cancellation instructions below.

How to cancel device leases and service or maintenance agreements
To cancel the lease on printers, the department should work directly with the supplier to make the necessary arrangements, such as providing written notice of cancellation and coordinating the return of the equipment. The process typically involves following the terms and conditions outlined in the lease agreement, including any required notice period. Departments will be responsible for any costs associated with the cancellation of their agreement. Ensuring clear communication and documenting all interactions can help facilitate a smooth cancellation process."

How do I use a Cardinal Print device and start printing?

If you are a guest or visitor, please see the Guests and Visitors section of this FAQ .
There are three ways for faculty, staff, contractors, and students to start printing:

Download the universal Cardinal Print driver
Log in to the Cardinal Print Center to upload documents
Send your attachment(s) via email to Cardinalprint@Stanford.edu from your Stanford email address​

To retrieve your print jobs,go to any Cardinal Print device andlog in to retrieve your print jobs by placing your SU ID card or mobile key over the card reader,or entering your SUNet ID and password on the screen. Next, choose ""Print""to select your print jobs and print them out.
Easy-to-follow instructions to print, copy, and scan are posted above each device on campus. You can learn more about how to use Cardinal Print devices with these simple instructions and videos. Visit Mobile Printing for complete instructions on how to print via email or by logging into Cardinal Print Center. For more specific questions about how to print, see the Print section of this FAQ page. For more specific questions about how to scan, fax or copy, see the Scan, Fax, or Copy section of this FAQ page.

Where do I place my Stanford ID Card to log in to the device?
You must place your Stanford ID card or mobile keyon the card reader to badge in. Card reader locations vary depending on the device model:

CP Cardinal (C5550i - older model) — to the left of the LCD panel (see card location on image A)
CP Cardinal, CP Marguerite, CP Tressider — to the right of the LCD panel (see card location on image C)
CP Co-Ho — to right of the document feeder (see card location on image B)






Can I log in to a Cardinal Print device without my Stanford ID?
Yes, you can log in with your mobile key or by touching the touchscreen where it says “touch here to begin,” and entering your SUNet ID and password.
Why do I have to badge in / sign in to use Cardinal Print?

When you send a document to print, Cardinal Print holds it in a secure print queue for 72 hours. The document does not print during that time until you go to any Cardinal Print device, tap your SU ID, mobile key, or enter your network credentials on the screen, and select Print Release. The advantages of badging in include:

Security. Using your SU ID, mobile key, or SUNet ID and password to print the document ensures that your printout is secure,because a document will not print until you log in at the device. You do not need to rush to a printer to pick up a sensitive document after you send it to print.
Convenience. It only takes a moment to swipe your badge at the device. If you forget your badge, you can still print by logging in with your mobile key or network credentials at the device. Additionally, you can pick up your printout at any Cardinal Print  device by “badging in” (Print Anywhere)!

For detailed printing instructions, see How to Print a Document on a Cardinal Print Device.

My University ID card is not working when I try to badge in to Cardinal Print. What do I do?

The Cardinal Print program is accessible for Stanford University faculty, staff, contractors, and students with active Stanford affiliations. If you are an active faculty, staff, contractor, or student and your card is not allowing you access to Cardinal Print, here are some solutions and tips that can help:

Remove your card from your lanyard or wallet and place it on the card reader separately. The card reader may try to read other cards and this will cause interference. (Examples: Clipper Card, School of Medicine ID, building access badge, apartment fob)The old cards had a read range of about 15 inches and could work with some obstruction such as a wallet or purse. The new chips are more secure and have a read range of only about 3 to 4 inches. They don’t work well with obstructions and will not work through most wallets or purses. If you keep your card in a holder with your Clipper Card or hospital badge, you will need to pull the card from the holder to use with a card reader. Another suggestion is to keep the card in a separate holder but on the same clip.
Only your Stanford University ID card is compatible with the Cardinal Print card reader. Other cards like School of Medicine or recreation center cards will not work. If needed, request a Stanford University ID card.
If your University ID was issued before 2016, you may need a new card. To determine if you need a new card, look at the number on the back of your card at the bottom. If there is an ""-E"" in the number, (e.g., 6*123456-E) then you do not need a new card. If there is no ""-E"" in the number, (e.g., 123456, or 6*123456) then you do need a new card.
You can always touch the screen to enter your SUNet ID and Password using the keypad provided. If needed, request a new Stanford University card.

Note: If you bring your current card with you to pick up your new card, you won't be charged for the replacement.

Does Cardinal Print support Apple iOS (iPhone or iPad) devices?

Yes, you can submit an attached document via email to cardinalprint@stanford.edu or upload via the web to https://cardinalprintcenter.stanford.edu.
Currently, no driver or app store application is supported for iOS.
For further details, please reference the following links:

How to use mobile printing with Cardinal Print
How to use the Cardinal Print Center


How do I get a print driver for Cardinal Print?

Most Cardinal Print users automatically receive a Cardinal Print driver through Stanford's Endpoint Configuration Management service (BigFix). If you do not have the driver, you can download one from the Cardinal Print website.

When I download the driver to my Apple macOS device, why do I see a dialog box asking me to allow the download?
If you have never downloaded anything from the uit.stanford.edu website to your macOS device (not iOS), you will see a dialog box asking if you will allow the download from this website. Select Allow to continue with the download.
How do contractors gain access to Cardinal Print?

A department administrator will need to visit the Contractor-Vendor ID Card webpage to request a Stanford ID card for the contractor, and be sure to state that the contractor will need access to Cardinal Print. 

How do I use Cardinal Print with a Linux device?

Although there is no Linux print driver available for Cardinal Print, you can add a Cardinal Print LPD printer. Just ensure your SUNet ID is specified with your print jobs.:
//as-mpsrwc-prd.stanford.edu/CardinalPrintLinux
Here is an example adding the LPD printer using shell commands:
lpadmin -pcardinalprintlinuxprd -E -v lpd://as-mpsrwc-prd.stanford.edu/CardinalPrintLinux
Additionally, you can print a single document using shell commands, such as this example:
<SUNet account>@psprcuat50> date;lp -d cardinalprintlinuxprd test.txt
You can also print from a Linux device by uploading a document to the Cardinal Print Center or by sending it to print via email (mobile printing).

Why do I see an extra pop-up login screen when I use Cardinal Print?

When you use a Mac computer, or a PC that is not Stanford domain-joined, you see an additional pop-up login screen at the beginning of each session. This pop-up appears after you log out of or restart your computer.
If you have a PC, you can have the computer joined to the Stanford domain. Consult your desktop support team to determine whether this is an option. Although there is no workaround for the Mac computer, our team is currently investigating a permanent solution to this issue.

How can I update the saved SUNet ID I use to log in to Cardinal Print on my Mac?
Follow these steps to clear the information saved on your Mac.
Can I log in to several Cardinal Print devices at the same time?
For security reasons, you can only log in to one Cardinal Print device at a time.
Is Mobile Key compatible with Cardinal Print?
Yes, Mobile Key is compatible with Cardinal Print! Mobile Key is the expanded functionality of Stanford Mobile ID, allowing you to use your phone as a digital key card in place of your physical Stanford ID card to access open doors, retrieve print jobs at Cardinal Print devices, and more. Click here to learn more about Mobile Key. 
Important notes about Mobile Key: 
*The first time you log into any Cardinal Print device, badge in with a physical card or by entering in your SUNet ID and Password. Once you've logged into a Cardinal Print device in one of these two ways, your SUNet will be registered and you will be able to log in using your Mobile Key within 1 hour and going forward.* After installing Mobile Key on your phone, it takes 24 hours for Mobile Key to fully activate and work with all card readers, including Cardinal Print card readers.  * Deleting and reinstalling the Stanford Mobile application will cause a new mobile key to be issued, and will take 24 hours for Mobile Key to become active as well.* After transitioning to a new phone, Mobile Key will appear to have transitioned over, but will not work. In this case, you will need to delete the Stanford Mobile App, reboot your device, reinstall the Stanford Mobile application, and activate Mobile Key again.

If I send a document to print, how long does it stay in the Cardinal Print queue?
The document is held in a secure print queue for 72 hours, and is deleted immediately after you release it to print on a device. If you do not print the document within 72 hours, it is automatically deleted by the system.
How do I print from my mobile phone?
To print from your mobile phone, see Mobile Printing.
How do I finish printing a job after it has been interrupted?

If your print job is interrupted while you are printing (i.e., paper jam, out of paper, or toner), and you are not able to correct the problem before the device logs out of your account, the job will be canceled for security reasons. To continue printing, you will need to resend your print job and use the print settings to start on the page where you left off.

Can I plug a USB device into a USB port on a Cardinal Print device to print?
No. USB devices are disabled to prevent write access of PHI to unencrypted USB storage devices. USB devices are also disabled to prevent the spread of malware via infected USB flash drives and other portable storage, per industry best practices.
I need to print a document on specialized paper, labels, or envelopes (manual printing). How do I do this with Cardinal Print?

For instructions on printing on these media types, see How to Print Manually with Cardinal Print. If you are printing labels, follow these steps:

Make sure you are using labels designed for laser printers, not inkjet printers.
Use a full sheet of labels. If a label is missing from a sheet, a pocket is created on the sheet and the device could jam.
Load labels face up in the multi-purpose tray.
Make sure you select Labels as the paper type at the device.
Only use the multi-function tray to print labels. If labels are placed in the paper drawers, they may be curled during feeding and detach from the sheet.


Why are my color documents printing in black and white and double-sided?
Black-and-white printing and double-sided printing are default settings for Cardinal Print. To print a document in color or single-sided, change the print settings when you send the document to print. If you print from the online Cardinal Print Center, you can change the print settings for a document in the Print Options section in the bottom right of the screen. You can create a customized Print Profile that populates frequently used print settings such as printing 1-sided and color by following these steps for Windows or these steps for Mac.
My Mac computer will not print my Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat document in color. How can I fix this?

If your Mac computer will not print Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat documents in color with Cardinal Print, try changing the settings via one of these options:

Cardinal Print Center
Your Mac (macOS 13 Ventura)
Your Mac (macOS 12 Monterey and below)

Note: Please be mindful that the printing defaults are set to black and white and double-sided to save on toner and paper waste, so you’ll want to ensure you only select color and/or single-sided before printing when necessary for your print job.

How do I use the Cardinal Print Center to manage my print queue online?
Follow these instructions to use the Cardinal Print Center.
Why aren't my PDF files printing when I upload them to the Cardinal Print Center?

Mobile printing often has trouble with the complexities of larger PDF files. If you are having trouble printing your PDF files by uploading them to the Cardinal Print Center, we recommend printing with the Cardinal Print driver instead.

Why do I have to log in on my computer when printing?

When you use a Mac computer, or a PC that is not Stanford domain-joined, you see an additional pop-up login screen at the beginning of each session. This pop-up appears after you log out of or restart your computer.
If you have a PC, you can have the computer joined to the Stanford domain. Consult your desktop support team to determine whether this is an option. Although there is no workaround for the Mac computer, our team is currently investigating a permanent solution to this issue.

How do I print or copy with colate and staple options?

Make sure you're using a device equipped with internal stapling capabilities (most Cardinal Print models have this feature, except for the Canon 526, 527, 356, 357, and 359 series).

Department billing

How does my department pay for Cardinal Print?
Cardinal Print costs for both devices and impressions are integrated with University IT billing and billed monthly. The Cardinal Print Usage & Allotment Billing Application allows for departments to run monthly usage reports as well as set up printing allowances for student workers, or for faculty and staff to bill to multiple PTAs for grants and special projects.
What do department administrators need to do to enable faculty, staff, or students to print using department funds?

Departments must set up at least one PTA to be billed for all printing costs of faculty and staff whose primary affiliation is with that department. It is up to the department to determine how they will set up the PTA or PTAs for billing. You must designate at least one PTA for all staff in your department without a dollar limit, to be used for faculty and staff whose primary affiliation is in your organization. PTAs can be set up at any level of the org, and all orgs under the designated org will roll up for billing purposes.
You can also provide faculty, staff, and students access to your PTA or multiple PTAs at the user level. This allows departments to allot printing dollars to faculty, staff, and students for particular PTAs. Common examples of users in this category are temporary or part-time employees, student workers, graduate students, or research assistants. This method requires access to the new CP Billing allocation application, which you can request access to.
Once an additional PTA is added for a faculty, staff, or student they will be presented with a choice after badging into a Cardinal Print device.

Do faculty and staff need to have a PTA allotment in order to print?

Administrators will not need to enter a PTA allotment for your faculty and staff. Schools and departments will set up a PTA at the org level to which printing by faculty and staff (including post docs) will be charged.

Do staff and faculty in my department have unlimited printing?

Yes, if they were set up with the org level PTA then there is no limit on the amount they can print. However, you can still log into the CP Billing Allocation App at any time to view usage reports and see who is printing, when, and how much under your PTA.

Can a user still print if they reach their allotment limit?

Yes, if a user does not have enough funding left in their PTA allotment, they will be able to complete the current print job or set of copies by selecting a different cost center. For example, if a user prints 3 pages, but can only pay for 2, they will be able to print 2 pages, and will be prompted to log out and log back in to select another billing option and print the 3rd page.When a PTA Allotment is fully used it will no longer be provided as a billing option. If you decide to increase or decrease the allotment for a user, the change will take place the next time the user logs back in to a Cardinal Print device.

Can I view reports to see who is printing and charging to my department PTA?

Yes, you can generate and view Cardinal Print usage reports via the Cardinal Pring Billing Allocation Application in Oracle Financials. You will be able to see who is printing to your designated PTA(s), when they are printing, and how much they are printing. To do so, request access to the billing app.

Can a user set up with a usage PTA have free printing, or will the amount have to be updated frequently?

In the Cardinal Print Allotment & Usage Application, “Amount” and “Start date” are both required when adding access to a user outside of your organization or department. In order to set a user up with “free printing” you can set a very large dollar amount, like $9999. Alternatively, you can log into the Cardinal Print Allotment & Usage Application and update the amount periodically and the change will take place as soon as you have saved it.

What if someone accidentally selects the wrong usage PTA when printing or making copies? How can this be fixed?

These types of mistakes may happen from time to time. Your Finance team should be notified and can correct the error through journal allocations. Departments can determine whether it is worth doing the journal allocation based on the amount.

If I give students access to a PTA for Cardinal Print, will they be able to charge other costs to it? Will I need to ask our finance team to create a new PTA just for Student printing?

Giving students access to your PTA for Cardinal Print will NOT allow them to use this PTA for any other purpose. You will not be required to create a new PTA just for student printing.

How do we renew our department's Cardinal Print device contract?

At the end of the contract period, the Cardinal Print team will work with you to assess printing needs and facilitate the renewal or update of devices for the next contract term.

What if our department ends our Cardinal Print contract early?

If you decide to remove or relinquish Cardinal Print devices prior the contract expiration, a written notice must be provided to the Cardinal Print team at least 14 business days prior to the intended removal or relinquishment date, by submitting Help request
Your department will be accountable for the following:

Locating an Alternative Location: making reasonable efforts to find and secure an alternative location within your department for the Cardinal Print devices.
Collaboration with Cardinal Print Team: If an alternative location cannot be found, please collaborate with the Cardinal Print team to explore options and identify a department willing to assume the remainder of the contract term.
Payment Obligation: If an alternative location or reach an agreement with the Cardinal Print team before the specified removal date is not secured, the department is responsible for the financial terms of the contract for its remaining duration. This includes, but not limited to, payment of any monthly amounts under the contract, such as lease fees, maintenance costs, and other associated charges.

Sustainability

What is our current printer-to-user ratio?

In 2019, the printer-to-user ratio at Stanford is 2:3 (two printers for every three users). As part of Stanford’s long term sustainability goals, the Cardinal Print policy will help us to achieve a ratio closer to 1:12 (one device for every twelve users).

How can I help Stanford save money on printing?
See the Cardinal Print policy and adhere to the best practice recommendations.
Is an empty toner cartridge recycled?

Yes, the Cardinal Print team will recycle empty toner cartridges.


Print policy
For a full description of the Stanford University Print Policy, visit the Stanford University Print Policy page.

When did the Cardinal Print policy go into effect?

The Cardinal Print policy went into effect on February 1, 2021.

What is the purpose of a print policy at Stanford?

This policy supports the university’s stated long-term objectives regarding administrative functions including improving user experience, increasing efficiencies, mitigating security risks, achieving sustainability goals, and efficiently using financial resources.

How long will it take to implement Cardinal Print?

With the mandate announced to campus in February 2021, the Cardinal Print team will work to create a schedule to deploy as quickly as possible. Those with expiring leases will be considered high priority. It is anticipated that the campus-wide implementation, including student and guest printing, will be a multi-year process.

What are the benefits of the new Cardinal Print policy?

Expected benefits include:

Reduce Stanford’s environmental impact: Reduce Stanford’s use of toner, paper, and energy. All devices are ENERGY STAR® and EPEAT® certified. Program supports our sustainability goals, including becoming 80% carbon free by 2025 and achieving zero waste by 2030.
Print securely: Authenticate with your badge or login with your SUNet ID and password at a Cardinal Print Canon multifunction device (MFD) to print your job when and where you want it. Approved for high risk and protected health information (PHI) data.
Print anywhere: Print securely from any device including your tablet or mobile device. Pick up your printout at any Cardinal Print Canon MFD.
Print quickly: Be more productive with new, upgraded MFDs.
Use advanced features: Scan directly to email, and staple to your printouts. 3-hole punching and scan to cloud functionality can be added to your service.


Why am I encouraged to get rid of my personal printer?

Personal printers (single-function devices) are a major security risk for individuals, departments, and the university. These risks include:

Vulnerability. An inadequately managed personal printer is easy to hack. Printers have software that needs to be properly configured and kept updated. Printers are one of the most commonly targeted devices; one-third of all cyber vulnerabilities across Stanford are associated with printers.
Compromised data. A hacker can use a compromised printer to bypass network firewall controls, access confidential documents and data from past print jobs, and attack other applications, systems, and networks.

Cardinal Print is Stanford’s recommended solution. The program ensures managed print devices are properly configured and maintained, replacing vulnerable printers with secure, multifunction devices and appropriately managed networks.

Will all machines be replaced with a Canon device? What about my personal printer?

Current print devices will be consolidated and replaced by multi-function devices provided by Canon Solutions America. Personal printers are not supported by the Cardinal Print Network. To learn more about the Cardinal Print program, please request a Cardinal Print assessment.

What will happen to inkjet printers, including those connected to medical devices?

Inkjet printers and other personal or single-function printers not connected to the Stanford network are allowed under the Cardinal Print policy.

Can my department opt to not participate in Cardinal Print?

The Cardinal Print program is a university-wide strategic initiative that makes printing more secure and sustainable and improves how departments manage their work processes. After numerous successful rollouts within different departments across campus, it is now the required print solution at Stanford. If you have specialized printing needs, the Cardinal Print team will work with you to ensure that your goals are met.

This sounds like a big change. How will you help my department adjust to Cardinal Print?

The Cardinal Print change management team provides consultations/assessments to understand your unique needs, personalized onboarding and training, instructional videos, and written instructions.

Desktop & Device Support,Jamf @Stanford FAQS,"Below is a list of common questions and answers for Jamf @ Stanford.

On this page:
About Jamf at StanfordJamf for macOSJamf for iOS/iPadOS

Jamf @ Stanford
What is Jamf @ Stanford?Jamf is a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution for managing the Apple platform. With Jamf, we can proactively manage the entire lifecycle of all Apple devices. Lifecycle management for macOS includes deploying and maintaining software, responding to security threats, distributing settings, and analyzing inventory data.How does Jamf work?When a device enrolls with Jamf@Stanford, it uses the Apple Push Notification service (APNs) to communicate directly with the Jamf MDM instance in the cloud to receive configurations. The experience between a device and IT changes as new opportunities are available. As the Stanford Jamf system matures, setup can begin when a device comes out of the box (known as zero-touch deployment) without a technical consultant's physical interaction. A client can decide what applications and settings they want from the application catalog (coming later) while essential updates install in the background without downtime. What information does Jamf collect?We've customized our implementation to collect only the data needed to support Stanford Mac devices and keep our networks and data safe. Jamf can:
View model, serial number, and operating systemIdentify your device by nameReset lost or stolen device to factory settingsView disk encryption statusView information for installed applications (e.g. log files, plist settings files)
For a complete list of attributes, Jamf can view for a computer, review the Managing Computers > Inventory for Computers > Computer Inventory Information Reference section of the latest version at the Jamf Pro Administrator’s Guide.What information does Jamf NOT collect?Jamf does not collect personal information, such as the contents or names of individual files (documents, email, etc.) or any browsing history. Jamf can't:
View browsing history on a deviceSee your personal emails, documents, contacts, or calendarAccess your passwordsView, edit, or delete photosView frequency of application useSee the location of a device

Jamf for macOS
Why has Stanford chosen Jamf to replace HCL BigFix on Stanford Macs?Due to security changes in recent versions of the macOS architecture, BigFix is no longer adequately performing the tasks needed to manage Apple's operating system. As we transition management systems to Jamf, BigFix will remain until Jamf provides management parity. The same teams who currently govern BigFix will manage Jamf.How do updates work?Jamf’s software updates and patching will usually be invisible to you. Software updates download to your computer in the background at a speed that allows your computer tasks to proceed without interruption or delay. App Store updates are installed daily around midnight, whereas third-party apps might have their own schedule. Microsoft apps are updated monthly and installed automatically if the programs are closed.Will I still have administrative access to my Mac?There will be no automatic changes to the privileges of your device.How do I know if Jamf is installed on my device?Open System Preferences > Profiles. From the list on the left, click on Stanford Device Management. On the right, you should see “Description: https://jamf.stanford.edu”.I received a Profile Installation Failed error message when trying to install Jamf. What does this mean?If you receive an error message stating “Profile installation failed,"" it’s likely your macOS device is already enrolled in Jamf, and no further action is required.In the MDM Profile, it shows in red text that Jamf has the ability to delete data from my computer. Should I be worried?For transparency reasons, Jamf’s capability as it relates to erasing data is displayed. This is a standard function of any device management system. Be assured that your data is safe and we will not take this action without your consent. This function is generally reserved for lost or stolen devices.What is Self-Service App?Included with Jamf enrollment or accessible via the App Store, Self-Service empowers end-users with access to University-approved applications and configurations through a click of a button. The highly customizable Self Service catalog features productivity, compliance, connectivity software, and more. You can install software or quickly configure your device without IT intervention by launching Self Service from your Applications folder. Some groups might see the Self-Service icon on their desktop. Visit the Jamf website to learn more about Apple self-service.
Jamf for iOS/iPadOS
What if I don't want device management?Device management is required to:
Access the Stanford network while on campusUse Cardinal Key
If you are certain that the implications of having an unmanaged device will not impact you, you may remove management from a non-Stanford purchased device by navigating to mydevices.stanford.edu and following these instructions for removing your device from MDM.I received a Profile Installation Failed error message when trying to install the Jamf profile. What does this mean?You received a pop-up error message that says: “The new MDM payload does not match the old payload.” because you already have a Mobile Device Management (MDM) profile installed. You can only have one MDM on your device at a time.To resolve this, navigate to Settings, Open the Profile of the installed Mobile Device Management and select Remove Management. You can then enroll in the new Device provider (Jamf) and download that profile. My device is new or otherwise unmanaged. How do I enroll it into Jamf?If your device is new or unmanaged, follow these instructions to enroll in Jamf.What is Self-Service App?Included with Jamf enrollment or accessible via the App Store, Self-Service gives you access to a curated set of university-approved applications and configurations. The customizable Self-Service catalog features productivity, compliance, connectivity software, and more. You can install software or quickly configure your device without IT intervention by launching Self-Service from your mobile device. Visit the Jamf website to learn more about Apple self-service.Note: The Self-Service app does not have access to view what apps you already have installed on your device, so you may see it offer an option to install an app you already have.How do I opt-out of the automatic installation of the Gmail App?Open the Self Service app on your mobile device to install the ""Block - Gmail App Installation"" configuration profile.Completion will be indicated by a ""Block-SU-Gmail-App"" Web Clip appearing on your home screen.

Desktop & Device Support,How to Set the Wi-Fi Random Hardware Address Feature in Windows 10,"When the Random hardware addresses feature is enabled, your hardware (MAC) address will change based on the options you select. The available options are On, Off, and Change daily. Selecting On enables the feature and assigns the same randomly generated hardware address. Selecting Change daily randomly generates a new hardware address everyday. You can also individually adjust the setting for each Wi-Fi network your machine connects to. For example, you can select Change daily for your home network but disable the feature for other networks.
Note: Stanford School of Medicine Information Resources and Technology (IRT) recommends leaving this feature disabled. Stanford uses your static hardware address to grant access. If you enable random hardware addresses, you will experience issues connecting to Stanford Wi-Fi. This feature can also cause issues connecting to hotel or other Wi-Fi networks. Most Wi-Fi systems use a static hardware address to grant access.

Desktop & Device Support,How do I register a new School of Medicine printer for network printing?,"Printers that are network-capable need to be registered for network access just like computers. Please note that printers should only be connected to the network via an Ethernet cable - printers should not be connected to the Stanford wireless network.
Before registering printer, work with University IT to see if Cardinal Print is available in desired location as an option.
To register a printer, follow the steps below. If you have any trouble with these steps, please call IRT at (650) 725-8000 or file a HelpSU ticket.

Obtain the printer's physical address (also called MAC, hardware, or ethernet address)

This can be done by printing a configuration page on most network-capable printers. Many printers have an LCD screen and buttons to navigate menu options. Printing a configuration page is usually in the Information menu under Configuration Page or in the Reports menu under Configuration page.


Set the printer for DHCP

Most network-capable printers ship with a default setting of obtaining an IP address via DHCP (BootP can also be used if DHCP is not available). This can be verified through the configuration page printed in step 1. The manner in which the printer obtains its IP address can be changed through the LCD menu by navigating to the configuration section for the network and setting the configuration method to DHCP.


Call (650) 725-8000 and provide the following information:

Building and room number of the printer
Physical/hardware address of the printer (from step 1)
Make and model of printer
SUNet ID of the printer’s administrator
Department to whom the printer belongs



The technician you speak with should give you the IP address after the printer is registered.The printer should then be registered within 15-20 minutes. After this, you may need to reboot the printer for it to obtain its IP address. We recommend that you tape a piece of paper with the printer's IP address on the printer for easy reference.

Introduction
Password rules
Pass phrases
Change/reset password
What the system looks for



Introduction
One of the potentially weakest links in computer security is the individual password. Despite the University's efforts to keep hackers out of your personal files and away from Stanford-only resources (e.g., email, web files, licensed software), easily-guessed passwords are still a big problem.
Stanford implements a strict password checking system for SUNet IDs to combat this problem. Each time you open a new account or change (reset your password, the system will prevent you from setting a password that is easily cracked. 
In addition, Stanford now recommends ""pass phrases"" instead of passwords. Pass phrases are longer, but easier to remember than complex passwords, and if well-chosen can provide better protection against hackers.
People who work in organizations which are a part of the ""Covered Entity"" under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) should reset their SUNet ID password if there is a security concern. Explore the Stay Safe From Phishing Scams website for tips on how to recognize, report, and stay vigilant about phishing scams.
Password rules
Stanford's password rules, based on password length, are:

8-11: mixed case letters, numbers, & symbols
12-15: mixed case letters & numbers
16-19: mixed case letters
20+: no restrictions
It must not be equal to your current password, previous passwords, SUNet ID, or password reset answer
It must not be a single word that appears in the dictionary (English or non-English)
It must be composed only of characters in the Roman alphabet, numbers, or symbols on the US keyboard. Examples include characters such as # $ % ! @.

Consider using four or more unrelated words with mixed capitalization, separated by punctuation or spaces. If you have trouble remembering a longer password, write it down on a piece of paper, put the paper in your wallet, and use the same caution with it as you would with a credit card.
Creating a pass phrase
A pass phrase is basically just a series of words, which can include spaces, that you employ instead of a single pass ""word."" Pass phrases should be at least 16 to 25 characters in length (spaces count as characters), but no less. Longer is better because, though pass phrases look simple, the increased length provides so many possible permutations that a standard password-cracking program will not be effective. It is always a good thing to disguise that simplicity by throwing in elements of weirdness, nonsense, or randomness. Here, for example, are a couple pass phrase candidates:

pizza with crispy spaniels
mangled persimmon therapy

Punctuate and capitalize your phrase:

Pizza with crispy Spaniels!
mangled Persimmon Therapy?

Toss in a few numbers or symbols from the top row of the keyboard, plus some deliberately misspelled words, and you'll create an almost unguessable key to your account:

Pizza w/ 6 krispy Spaniels!
mangl3d Persimmon Th3rapy?

Authentication,How to Create a SUNet ID From a Sponsorship Invitation,"Your SUNet ID is an account name that identifies you, uniquely and permanently, as a member of the Stanford community. You'll use it to log into most secure online services; your access to specific online services is determined by your eligibility and affiliation with Stanford. Your SUNet ID is used by many Stanford business systems and cannot be easily changed, so choose one that you will be confident to say aloud to professors, managers, and colleagues. If you qualify for a Stanford email address, your default email address will be your-sunetid@stanford.edu. See the SUNet IDs in Detail page for more information about policies and services.
Create a SUNet ID
Your Stanford sponsor begins the process by entering personally identifiable information such as your full name and date of birth into the Stanford system. When your sponsor's task is complete, you'll receive an email inviting you to choose a SUNet ID and password.
To set up your SUNet ID:

Authentication,How to Close Your SUNet ID Account: Students and Graduates,"Overview
This page summarizes what happens to your email and other online services after you are no longer enrolled at Stanford (e.g. a leave of absence, graduation). You may have found your way here because you received notification that your SUNet ID account will soon close. This page helps you determine what ""your account is closing"" means to you, and what you need to do.
Depending upon when and why you leave Stanford, your SUNet ID account services will change or end. You are given a grace period to help you during this transition. Access ends or changes when the grace period expires (see table, below).
Account expiration and grace period
Students



Leave of Absence

Students who are granted an official leave of absence by the Registrar's Office maintain their full service SUNet ID for the length of their leave of absence.



Other

When you transfer or leave the university for other reasons (besides a leave of absence or graduation), your account enters a 120-day grace period. If at the end of this grace period your affiliation has not been reactivated, your SUNet ID account services, including email, will end. However, the Stanford Alumni Association provides free, permanent Alumni email accounts* to students who have spent three quarters or more in a degree-granting program.
*GSB graduates only: if you are leaving the Stanford GSB after three or more quarters, please contact sbsaa@gsb.stanford.edu.




Graduates



Graduated in the last five years

When you graduated, your account entered a 120-day grace period.  This will allow you continued access to your @stanford.edu email, access to licensed electronic resources while on campus and on a Stanford network; however, off-campus access to electronic resources stops when you graduate, visit Stanford Libraries for details.
Your Stanford directory listing (StanfordWho) will no longer appear. You will not be able to log into the Stanford view of StanfordWho.
120 days after you graduate, your account will change to a base level account. This base level account is good for five years, giving you access to your transcripts and other online information, but not to @stanford.edu email. Email access ends when the grace period ends, and any email left on the university mail servers will be deleted. However, you are eligible for a permanent Stanford Alumni email account* if you qualify under the Stanford Alumni Association definition of “alumni”, i.e., have completed 3 or more quarters in a Stanford degree-granting programs.
If you are eligible for and create an alumni account, new email sent to your @stanford.edu address after it closes is sent automatically to your @alumni.stanford.edu address for two years. Set up autoreply for your @stanford.edu email address at any point during those two years to notify others of your new @alumni.stanford.edu address.
*GSB graduates only: visit GSB Stay Connected for details about GSB alumni email options and information on managing your existing email, contacts, calendar, and docs before your account closes. If you create an account prior to the end of the 120 day grace period, new email sent to your @stanford.edu address, after it closes, will automatically forward to @alumni.gsb.stanford.edu for two years.



Graduated more than five years ago

If you graduated more than five years ago, your SUNet ID account is inactive. You are eligible for a permanent Stanford Alumni email account if you qualify under the Stanford Alumni Association definition of “alumni”, i.e., have completed 3 or more quarters in a Stanford degree-granting programs.




Postdoctoral Scholars  



When Appointment Ends

You have continued access to your Stanford email account for a 120-day grace period after your appointment ends.  Email access ends when the grace period ends, and any email left on the university mail servers will be deleted.        
Postdoctoral scholars in good standing may request that their Stanford email be forwarded to a personal account for 2 years after the end of their appointment.  For further information, please visit Postdoc Email Forwarding FAQs. Note that email cannot be sent from your Stanford email address during this period, nor are there storage capabilities.

Account expiration and grace period



Faculty
When your affiliation with Stanford ends, your SUNet account enters a 120-day grace period which bridges you between the end of one academic year and the start of the next. If, at the end of this grace period, your affiliation has not been reactivated (i.e., you have left the university), your SUNet services end.


Staff

Access to @stanford email and other online services ends on the last day of your employment. This includes access to those Stanford business systems for which your SUNet ID served as login ID (e.g., Axess, Oracle Financials, PeopleSoft Student Administration). If you need copies of personal email or files, be sure to make them in advance. You should change ownership of any Box, Google, and Office 365 documents that others may need access to after your employment ends.



Sponsored staff

If your SUNet account is sponsored (i.e., someone in the university has agreed to pay for you to use SUNet services for a fixed period of time) your sponsored services end when your sponsorship ends. You will receive email reminders 30 and 7 days before the expiration date of your sponsorship; use that time to either get your sponsorship renewed or to close your account.

Document Management & Collaboration,TDS - Common Medicine Box Issues and Their Resolutions/Workarounds,"KBB0010009SoM: Transfer Large Amounts of Data to Med Box

Below is a list of some common Medicine Box issues and their resolutions or workarounds.
Uploading
Logging In
Quarantined Files
Mobile Devices
Sharing
Virtual Machines (VMs)
Note: As of 12/27/2019, it will no longer be possible to upload a folder in Box, using IE 11. Alternatives would include using a modern/supported browser, or Box Drive (or using IE to upload a file at a time)
Unable to upload file to Box or create a folder in Box
This issue can be caused by several things, depending on where you run into this issue. Please always try uploading the data directly to the Box website if you are having problems with Box Sync or Box Drive, as even if it fails it will provide more information as to why.

Insufficient Permissions to Upload File/You do not have permission to upload to this folder: This is typically caused by uploading at the top level of Box. The places where you can create new data or upload is limited to within folders that have been shared to you (you will need any permissions level which includes Upload), your externally shareable files folder, and your files folder marked Safe for PHI & PII.
File Size Exceeded: Box currently has a hard file size limit of 15GB for what can be uploaded. If possible, please break up the file into smaller files if it is only going to be used for archiving. If the data will need to be actively used from Box, then you may need to look for a different solution.
File Name Not Supported: Please see the Box Sync and Box Drive support articles on unsupported names.
Unsupported File Type: There are specific files types that Box will not allow to be uploaded through Box Drive or Box Sync. The workaround is to upload the files through the web.

Unable to log into the Medicine Box Website

Device Not Fully Secure:

There are multiple causes for this specific error:

This can be caused by your computer not being encrypted. Stanford Medicine Box can only be accessed by computers that have been encrypted. This includes all internal disks. For more detail, please see our How to Fix ""Device Not Fully Secure"" Error in Medicine Box article.
This error will also appear if you have unencrypted external media connected, such as a flash drive, CD/DVD, external drive, or Google File Stream.
To use both Box and Google File Stream simultaneously, download Box Drive, ensure it works fine, then install Google Drive File Stream. Your Box Drive connection and Google Drive File Stream will remain working. If Medicine Box folder permissions need to be done, disconnect the Google Drive File Stream, then launch a private browser to access Medicine Box. 
If none of these apply, please contact the IRT Service Desk for further assistance at (650) 725-8000




Browser Version or Configuration:

One of the causes for this is if you are using either Safari, Internet Explorer, or Edge. Please note that at this time Microsoft Edge cannot be used to access Medicine Box.

For Internet Explorer, please see Box's Internet Explorer Configuration Guide.
For Safari, please see the Safari section of the Box Tools Install Guide.


This can also be caused by the web browser being out of date. You can check to see if your browser is up to date by going to settings and then about [your browser].


Problem Determining Device Security:

This can happen if there is an issue with Box Tools/Edit running on your computer.
A restart of the computer will typically get Box Tools/Edit to work again, which will allow you to sign in.

Another solution can be to uninstall Box Tools/Edit, restart the computer, and then install the latest version by logging in again and downloading and installing when prompted.
This issue can also be caused by a combination of the errors above so if the issue is not resolved by the re-installation of Box Tools/Edit, please try the other troubleshooting steps above, or reach out to the TDS Service Desk at (650) 725-8000.




Invalid Login Credentials:

This is caused by logging into the incorrect portal for Box. Please see our Stanford Medicine Box: ""Invalid login credentials"" Error article or not having opted in for a Stanford Medicine Box account


You currently do not have a Stanford Medicine Box account:

This can be fixed by opting in to the Stanford Medicine Box instance. Please see our You May Need to Opt in to Use Medicine Box article.

If you had a Medicine Box account in the past, but are missing data after opting-in and signing into Medicine Box, please reach out to the TDS Service Desk at (650) 725-8000.





Quarantined files

For quarantined files, you can download the files that have been quarantined and then move them to a folder that is marked ""Safe for PHI & PII"". You can then remove yourself from the Quarantine folder. For more information, or how to proceed if you believe this is a false positive, please see our My File Has Been Quarantined by Stanford Medicine Box article.

Deleted files

If you delete a file by mistake and are unable to find it, please check the Trash folder.  Stanford Medicine Box is actually configured to keep deleted files for 90 days in the trash unless you manually empty the trash folder)

Unable to log into Box on a mobile device

Disabled by Administrator: This is caused by using the incorrect version of the Box app to access Medicine Box.

Unable to share folders/files to users

ACTION REQUIRED: A new Box collaboration created with a user outside of Stanford Medicine Box was not allowed:

This is caused by sharing a folder that is tagged as ""Safe for PHI & PII"" to an individual that is outside of the Stanford Medicine Box instance. If you receive this error and the individual is with Stanford, please have them opt-in to Stanford Medicine Box. Or, if the to-be-shared data is not High Risk, you could also consider moving the data into an Externally Shareable Files folder.


Receiving an email about a collaboration, but the link in the email doesn't go to the new content:

This is typically caused by a file/folder being shared to an alias email address.

A workaround is to share the file/folder to the user's SUNet ID or full name.
A solution is to have that individual add their alias email address to Stanford Medicine Box. They can do this under their profile once they have logged into Stanford Medicine Box. For more information for how to do so, please see our How to Link Your Email Alias to Medicine Box article.





Unable to open files in Windows

Filename is not valid, filename could not be found, or the file could not be accessed:

These errors are typically caused by the total file path being too long (too many characters) for Windows to understand.

The workaround is to rename the folders to shorter names.
The fix for the issue (only for Windows 10 computers) is to enable Long Path. Instructions can be found on Microsoft's Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces support document under the section for Maximum Path Length Limitation.





Adding Medicine Box Drive/Sync to a Virtual Machine

When accessing Box Drive/Sync on a VM, it needs to be handled in one of two ways:

Encrypt and password protect the VM: This can be done by manually enabling BitLocker on a Windows system or by enabling FileVault on a Mac system. You must also have a password set for the account you are logging into for the VM.
If the hosting computer is already compliant, you can install Box Drive/Sync, then go into the Virtual Machine hosting program and select to share the folder labeled Box or Box Sync. As long as the host machine has Box Drive/Sync running and signed in, you will be able to access the folders and files through the shared folder list."

Step by step installation instructions for Windows and Mac

Limitations/Known issues
There are a few limitations and known issues with using Drive for desktop.
Shared drives file editing
If you share a document in a Shared drive with a person who is not a member of that Shared drives, that person will only have the ability to “edit” the file. Shared drives editors cannot edit any Shared drives files when they are open in Drive for desktop; they can only view them. To edit Shared drives files, the editor must open the file in Google Shared drives in a web browser.
Notes:

Starting July 19, 2021: Backup and Sync will support a guided flow to help users transition onto Drive for desktop.
Starting Aug. 18, 2021: Any users still on Backup and Sync will start to receive in-product notifications prompting them to transition to Drive for desktop.
Starting Oct. 1, 2021: Any users still on Backup and Sync will no longer be able to sign in to Backup and Sync. To continue syncing with Drive and/or Google Photos, users will need to transition to Drive for desktop."
Document Management & Collaboration,Google Shared drives FAQ,"What types of files can be added to Google Shared drives?
All file types can be added to a Shared drive, except Google Maps and existing documents with attached Apps Scripts.
Can I move a folder from My Drive to a Shared drive?
No. You cannot move folders from a My Drive to a Shared drive. You can only move files, but you can move multiple files at once. For more information and instructions see Migrate Files to Google Shared drives.
Can I sync files to my computer?
No, currently the laptop/desktop Google Drive sync tool does not sync files stored in Shared drives. If you are the owner of a large share in your My Drive and you use Google Drive sync tool to sync files to and from your desktop or laptop machine, you will not be able to sync the files if you move them to a Shared drive. Google recently released Google File Stream for enterprise and educational institutions.
Can I use a Drive Volume Letter (e.g. G:) for my Google Drive Sync Folder?
No. You cannot use a drive volume letter for your Shared drives files. This feature is expected in a future release of the Google Drive desktop application.
How long do files I delete stay in Trash?
Each Shared drive has its own trash. Files and folders in the Trash are deleted forever after 30 days. Team members can delete specific files sooner.
Can I restore deleted files?
Yes, you can restore deleted files if you have Edit access or full access."

On the form, click the Settings option at the top.
Expand the Responses section to reveal options.
Enable ""Restrict to users in Stanford University and its trusted organizations"""
Document Management & Collaboration,Accessibility Best Practices When Creating Google Forms,"When creating forms through Google Forms, it’s important for your content to be web accessible to your audiences. This includes audiences with hearing or visual impairments who may rely on assistive technologies to both understand and interact with your web forms.  
Below are a few best practices to follow while creating forms through Google Forms. They’re as simple as adding descriptive context and thoughtful structure to allow everyone to understand and complete the tasks within your web form. 
Use sections
If your form is long, it’s good practice to use sections with clear headings to break it up into digestible, comprehensive chunks. Sections help reduce the stress of your reader and offer a good stopping point to take a break.
Describe response validation rules
Help users fill out your Google Forms through Response validation. Response validation allows you to create rules that users have to follow as they interact with your form. For example, if you want to limit an answer to be 500 characters or less, you would create a rule that will ensure the user enters a response that is less than 500 characters before they can move on in the form. 
To help users understand when a response is valid, include a description of format or other types of values you expect in the description field. 
Here’s an example of how: If you’re asking for a number between 1 and 10, add something like, “Please enter a number between 1 and 10” in the label or description for that field. For dates, provide the format expected (e.g., mm/dd/yyyy) in the description so that users will enter the date in a format that is valid. 

Avoid using images as part of questions
Google forms allows you to use an image as part of a question, but does not allow you to describe that image for non-sighted users, which renders the question inaccessible. It’s therefore best not to use images as part of your questions, and to use text options instead. If you need to use images for a question, make sure they are fully described as part of the question so someone who can’t see them can still answer the question based solely on the text.
Provide directions for linear scales
Screen readers read linear scale values (e.g., Satisfied, Dissatisfied) after reading each of the numbers. To make these easier to use, add the description of the scale in the question. For example: “On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being Satisfied and 10 being Dissatisfied, how do you…”"

Once your license or account is removed, your installations of Microsoft 365 ProPlus will go into a reduced functionality mode. In this mode, current documents will still be available, but new documents cannot be created.Notes
	You must connect to the Internet at least once every 30 days to use the Office apps you have downloaded from ProPlus. This is so that the status of your Microsoft 365 subscriptions can be checked. If you don’t connect within 30 days, Microsoft 365 ProPlus goes into reduced functionality mode. After you connect to the Internet and your subscription status is verified, all the features of Microsoft 365 ProPlus are available again.

Document Management & Collaboration,Create a Google Shared drive,"Anyone can create a Google Shared drive and then add members and set permissions. You can designate a Google Group as the membership for a Shared drive. Using Workgroup Integration, you can create a Google Group from existing Stanford Workgroups. Below you will find instructions for creating and managing Google Groups and Shared drives.
Create a Google Group
One of the advantages of Google Shared drives is that the group owns all of the documents in the Shared drives, so even if one member leaves, all of the documents remain.  You can use Workgroup Integration to create a Google Group from current Workgroups. Once the permissions are granted to your Google Group, access to the Shared drives is automatically adjusted when you add or remove members from your Stanford Workgroup, allowing you to manage access entirely from within Workgroup Manager.
To do this, follow the instructions on the Google Groups for Workgroups page to create a Google Group that you will then use as the owner of the Shared drives.

Allow up to 24 hours for the linked Google Group to appear on the Google Groups management site.
All administrators of the Workgroup become owners of the new Google Group.  All members of the Workgroup become members of the Google Group.
You can only use Workgroup Manager to maintain membership for Stanford users.  You can add non-Stanford users directly to the Shared drives within Google Apps.
When you create the Shared drives, you can name them anything you want and then in the membership list assign the Google Group name that the Workgroup Integration tool created, and give it Full access permission.  The Google Group name will be in the format stem_workgroup@stanford.edu.

Full access permission allows members full access to upload, edit, and delete files, as well as to invite other members to the Shared drives.
If you want some members of the Shared drives group to have only Edit, Comment, or View access, create separate Workgroups and then add those groups as members with the appropriate permissions.

Document Management & Collaboration,Migrate Files to Google Shared drives,"Uploading files
When using Google Shared drives, you can upload files and folders to a Shared drive in the same way that you upload files to your Google My Drive.  See instructions at Upload Files and Folders to Google Drive.  
Migrating files
You can also move files from your personal Google Drive, also known as My Drive, to a Shared drive.  Please note the following when moving files:
You cannot move a folder from My Drive to a Shared drive.  You must move the files, though you can move multiple files at one time.
Because you cannot move a folder, but must recreate a folder in Shared drives, folder permissions are not moved.  If you have given other users access to a folder on your My Drive, be sure to grant those permissions again in Shared drives.
You can move files owned by someone else, as long as the owner of the file in MyDrive is also a contributor, content manager or manager of the Shared Drive you are moving the item into or where the owner's account is disabled.Moving files to the Shared drives changes ownership from the individual to the team.File permissions and links do not change.  People who are not Shared drives members can still access the file with previously granted permission.
Best practices
When migrating files to a Shared drive from your personal Google Drive, do not drag and drop the files from one drive to another.  Follow the steps below to move the files.
Access your Google Drive and locate the files you want to move.Select the file or files by clicking on a single file or holding the Shift key while clicking all of the files you want to move.Right-click the mouse, or Ctrl-click if you are using a single-button mouse.Click Move to....In the drop down list, you will see a list of folders on your My Drive.

Document Management & Collaboration,How to Give Outside Users Access to Upload Files to Medicine Box Using File Request (formerly Upload Embed Widget),"If you're an Owner or Co-owner of a folder, File Request enables you to create a ""File Request"" link and either

get that link to share with people, or
embed the widget in your website, blog, or social networking service.

Both features enable you to enhance the ease and efficiency of collaboration, while maintaining security standards and avoiding email's file-size restrictions. And both features allow collaborators to directly upload content to your project folder without needing to log into Box.
Anyone, including people who do not have a SUNet ID, can upload files this way, as long as they have the link. Their computer does not have to be encrypted, but it is upload only.  They are ""blindly"" (they cannot see the folder name or contents) able to upload files to the specified folder.  This feature is approved for uploading PHI, provided that the File Request is created for a folder which is marked as ""Safe for PHI&PII"".
Creating a File Request Link
You can create a Box upload widget, and then share its link.
To create and configure a File Request Link:

In your Box account window, right-mouse click on the folder you want to share and select File Request. Box displays the File Request window.
Under Customize Options, check the options you want to enable.
To see what the widget looks like, click Preview.
After configuring the widget, under File Request Link click Copy. You can now share this link with other people.

Customization Options

Specify title enables you to add a displayed title to the widget.
Add instructions enables you to provide and display instructions on the widget for collaborators.
Allow users to add description displays a field on the widget where collaborators can add comments.
Require users to provide email displays a field on the widget where collaborators are required to provide their email addresses.

(Optional) For web authors: Embedding the Upload Embed Widget
After customizing the widget, you can embed it in a site that supports embedded HTML iframe code.
To embed the upload widget in your site:

In the File Request window, under Upload Embed Widget, click Copy.
Paste this HTML code into your site's code.

Note
The file request link and embedded upload widget do not allow people to send folders.
Known Limitations

You cannot modify the Upload Embed Widget code generated by the Web app.
Box does not support drag-and-drop in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Email notifications no longer display the uploader's name in the body of the email. To see who uploaded content, navigate to the folder for which the Upload Embed Widget was created.
Upload widgets are not optimized for mobile devices.

Always provide the least amount of access necessary while still allowing collaborators to work efficiently.
For files containing High Risk (non-PHI) Data, see our recommended sharing option.
How to share a file


Right-click on the name of the Google file. Click Share.


On the window that appears, enter the email address(es) of the person or people to whom you want to grant access. Avoid using mailing lists when possible.
Depending upon the Shared drives Settings, you might get a window that is titled “Share” or a window that is titled “Upgrade member’s access”. Both windows provide the same features to share files.


In the drop-down list, select the appropriate level of permissions for the users you will invite to collaborate: Edit, Comment, or View.


You can choose to send a message when you have completed the sharing process.


To send an email to the person or people to whom you have granted access, click Send.
If you do not want to send an email to the person to whom you have granted access, select Skip sending notification. Then click Add.



Who has access
The Who has Access window is available from the “Share” or “Upgrade members access to” window. In this window, you can designate more permissions or restrictions for those you’ve invited to the document. This is a recommended step for sharing High Risk (non-PHI) Data.


Link sharing

Turn link sharing on and off

When sharing Moderate or High Risk (non-PHI) Data, we recommend turning link sharing to ""off"" so the person you are granting access to is not able to share the document with anyone else.


Set the access available to people with the link, such as edit, view or comment
Get a link to send to people you want to have access to the document


Member access - Members that are listed under the Shared drive icon are granted permissions through the Shared drives Share settings. You can upgrade an individual user’s access to a file.
Additional users’ access - People who have been given access to the file, but are not members of the Shared drives, are listed at the bottom of the Who has access window. You can change their access permissions or remove them from access.
Restrict user actions - You can restrict the download, print and copy actions on this file for commenters and viewers by clicking the More icon.

In the case of a Shared drive with less restrictive file-sharing settings, set file access permissions to allow collaborators to access the file, but still restrict the file as much as possible. When setting permissions using the Who has access window, consider the following:

Restrict download, print and copy actions
Limit collaboration options to just Comment
Limit editing options to just View
Limit how the file can be found externally
Choose whether or not external access is allowed
Ensure Shared drives permissions do not interfere with the intent of your file permissions

Restricted Shared drives Settings
Link sharing options on the Who has access window are will be limited for a Shared drive that has very restricted file-sharing settings. Depending upon the Shared drives settings, you might not be able to share the file outside of the organization or with people who are not designated as members of the Shared drives. Restrictions are noted in the Who has Access window.
To learn more about file-sharing settings for Shared drives and how to change them, visit Set Share Options for Shared drives."

Document Management & Collaboration,Google Groups for Workgroups,"Owners of Stanford workgroups can use Workgroup Integration to create a new Google Group using the existing Stanford workgroup name and membership.
Once the Google Group is created and linked to your workgroup, you must use Workgroup Manager to maintain membership for Stanford users. Non-Stanford users can be added within Google Apps, not Workgroup Manager.
Notes: 

You can designate a Google Group as the membership for a Share Drive.
Workgroup Integration cannot be used to create Google Groups from personal workgroups.
You should not rename a Google Group through your Google Group's management interface. A renamed group and its data is automatically deleted without notice when a synchronization job runs to update Google Groups.
If you unlink a Google Group, the group and its data in Google is deleted.
You should not delete a Google Group through your Google Group's management interface. If you delete a Google Group through your Google Group's management interface, the workgroup linkage is left in an orphan state and cannot be synchronized. It is recommended that you go to Workgroup Manager to unlink the Google Group linkage to cleanly remove the linkage

To link a workgroup to a Google Group:

Log in to Workgroup Manager.
You'll see a list of all the workgroups for which you are the administrator. Click the name of the workgroup that you want to use to create a Google Group. 
When the members of the workgroup display, click the Workgroup Integration tab.
Click the Link associated with Google Group.
In the next window, click Link Workgroup.Note: The workgroup linkage process can take a few minutes. Please do not reload the page. 
When the linkage process has completed, the Workgroup Integration window shows the workgroup linked to Google Group.Note: Please allow up to 24 hours for a linked Google Group to show up on the Google Groups management site."

Websites,Add WordPress Plugins and Themes,"The WordPress installation comes with the default themes from WordPress, the Stanford Lagunita theme, and several plugins already installed. You may download and install additional themes and plugins created by the worldwide WordPress community. You must maintain these additional themes or plugins, however, so be careful to choose ones that work well.
Using pre-installed themes and plugins
Your WordPress installation comes with one Stanford theme and four plugins (Akismet, Hello Dolly, HTTP Authentication, and Stanford Reverse Proxy).
Stanford theme
The Stanford-branded Lagunita theme is the default theme for any installation of WordPress done through the WordPress Installer. The Lagunita theme is designed for members of the Stanford community at large. Official departments and administrative units can request the Stanford Cardinal theme by submitting a Help request. 
Note: Do not move, delete, or modify themes directly, because that breaks the upgrade process. The easiest and safest way to add functionality to a theme is to use a ""child"" theme. A WordPress child theme inherits the functionality of another theme, but allows you to modify it. Read more about child themes and how to create them at WordPress.org.
Akismet plugin
Akismet is an anti-spam service for websites that have comments enabled. The Akismet plugin checks for spam in the comments on your website, filters comments that look like spam, and lets you review the comments marked as spam. The plugin requires an Akismet.com API key. 
Hello Dolly plugin
The Hello Dolly plugin displays lyrics from the song ""Hello, Dolly"" in the WordPress Admin panel. This is a default plugin that most users leave inactivated. You can inactivate the plugin or delete it if you do not want it.
HTTP Authentication plugin
The HTTP Authentication plugin is a third-party plugin that Stanford uses to provide integration with WebAuth, allowing you and your users to log in to your WordPress site using your SUNetID and password. If you select WebAuth protection at installation, this plugin is activated for you.
Reverse-Proxy plugin
The Reverse-Proxy plugin is only needed by sites that are using a Web Virtual Host (also known as a vanity URL) that was set up a long time ago as a reverse proxy. Most new vanity URLs are not set up in this way, therefore new installations do not need this plugin, and it is inactive by default.
Using additional themes and plugins
There are thousands of free or low-cost non-Stanford themes and plugins available to add design or functionality to your WordPress site. You can browse themes and plugins on WordPress.org.  As with any software, the quality of themes and plugins varies. For theme and plugin recommendations from other WordPress users on campus, email the WordPress users mailing list. The Stanford University WordPress Community of Practice also maintains a list of plugins widely used at Stanford. University IT can not help you choose or maintain themes or plugins that you install on your own.
Installing themes and plugins through WordPress
Most, but not all, themes and plugins work on the Stanford web servers and installation can be done through WordPress.
Installing themes and plugins manually
Most plugins and themes can be installed through WordPress, but some, like the ones not on the WordPress Plugins Directory, need to be installed manually. If the plugin you are trying to install is one of these, follow the directions below for a manual install.
The WordPress software is installed on Stanford's distributed file system, called the Andrew File System (AFS). Follow these steps to install your own themes and plugins:
Download the themes or plugins to your computer.Unzip (expand) the themes or plugins on your computer.Connect to AFS using the secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) application or OpenAFS.
SFTP:  University IT provides two SFTP software programs free of charge: Fetch for Macintosh and SecureFX for Windows. Instructions on how to install the software and connect to shared servers are included on the Essential Stanford Software pages.
For Macintosh:
Download Fetch for MacintoshInstallation instructions for Fetch
For Windows:
Download SecureFX for WindowsInstallation instructions for SecureFX

OpenAFS: University IT packages OpenAFS client software for both Mac OS X and Windows. This software provides an alternative to SFTP clients like Fetch and SecureFX for people who frequently access files in AFS space. Follow the instructions on the OpenAFS pages to install and connect to (mount) your group or department directory.
Upload the plugins and themes to the location in AFS where WordPress is installed.Activate the themes or plugins using the WordPress Admin panel.

Websites,Qualtrics Accessibility and Usability,"Qualtrics has several options available to make your surveys more accessible. Follow the tips below to make your next Qualtrics survey optimized for the broadest audience possible.
Check survey accessibility
Qualtrics offers survey creators the option of running accessibility checks on surveys. If potential problems are found within the survey, the survey creator will be notified and given suggestions for how they can change the questions to make them more accessible.
Accessible and non-accessible question types
Did you know that multiple choice questions are accessible, while ""pick, group, and rank"" questions are not? Qualtrics gives examples of accessible and non-accessible question types so you know how to better serve survey responders. 
Auto-number questions
Set up your Qualtrics account to automatically number every question, which can help users with screen readers track their progress. 
Change button text
To better serve an international community, Qualtrics by default labels the button to continue to the next screen as "">>,"" and the button to go back as ""<<."" But by changing the button text to ""back"" and ""next,"" you can make your survey more accessible to users with screen readers.   
Change the default survey title
In Qualtrics, you are asked to name your survey when you first create it, and there is also the option to change your survey page title — or what users will see as the title on an open tab in a browser.
Qualtrics' default page title for all surveys is ""Online Survey Software | Qualtrics Survey Solutions,"" but Qualtrics recommends changing page titles to something more specific because page titles are usually the first thing that screen readers read. Changing this to something more specific to your survey will help users with screen readers better track content if they have multiple tabs open, especially if they have multiple Qualtrics surveys open.
To change the default survey title, click Survey Options. Find the text field that says Survey Title and change it to something that adequately and briefly describes the content of your survey. Click Save.

A: There is a policy that does not permit including a link to a commercial website on a Stanford website. Often these links produce an “affiliates” fee, which would be considered to be unrelated business income. Even if there is no affiliates fee, these links would be considered to be an endorsement of a commercial enterprise, which is contrary to Stanford’s policy.

Websites,How to Link to StanfordWho Listings and Search Results,"StanfordWho lets you add a link on a Stanford webpage that goes directly to a person's StanfordWho listing. You can use this option to avoid displaying static contact information on a webpage, where it can go out of date or be a target of spamming. You can also link from a Stanford webpage to the results of a search term such as the name of a department.
How to link to a person's StanfordWho listing
You can customize a URL to link directly to a person's listing. If a user who has not authenticated into the Stanford network clicks on this URL, they will go to the person's public view listing. 
An authenticated user who clicks this URL will go to the person's more detailed Stanford and Affiliates view listing. In some cases, the authenticated user will first be directed to the public view, where they can click Log in to reach the Stanford and Affiliates view.
Use the following URL to link to a person's StanfordWho listing:
To link via a SUNet ID:
https://stanfordwho.stanford.edu/people/[sunetid]Example: https://stanfordwho.stanford.edu/people/jdoe
To link via an email alias:
https://stanfordwho.stanford.edu/people/[email_alias]/
Note: The forward slash (/) following the URL must be included when linking via an email alias.

Example: https://stanfordwho.stanford.edu/people/John.Doe/
How to link to a search term result
Use the following URL to link directly to a search term result:
https://stanfordwho.stanford.edu/people?keyword=[search] 
In the [search] section of the URL, you can use any term or combination of terms allowed in the StanfordWho search box. Replace spaces and punctuation with characters as shown in the table below.
Note: A user who is not authenticated will see the public view search result when they click the URL; a user who is authenticated will see the Stanford and Affiliates view search result.

Websites,How to use the Public View on StanfordWho,"The StanfordWho web application lets you search the Stanford directory of faculty, staff, students, and sponsored affiliates at Stanford University and the Stanford hospitals to view contact and organization information. StanfordWho provides two ways to view the directory: a Public view and a restricted Stanford and Affiliates view. You must be logged in with your SUNet ID to search in the Stanford and Affiliates view.
The StanfordWho Public view only displays information with a Public visibility setting. To check or change your visibility settings, visit StanfordYou (faculty, staff, and sponsored affiliates) or Axess (students).
Enhancements to the Public view include:
Simpler searches across directories. You can begin a search for a colleague in the updated Public view and continue it in the Stanford and Affiliates view without re-entering the name.Visual consistency. The design of the updated Public view looks like the restricted Stanford and Affiliates view, providing more visual consistency across StanfordWho.Visibility into your role and department. Your department(s) appears on your profile, and you see associated departments of anyone you look up in the directory.The ability to search the Stanford directory by keyword topics. This allows you to search for Stanford colleagues by area of work or specialty.A visible Stanford ID card or Stanford Profiles (Community Academic Profiles, or CAP) photo. If you do not have a visible photo, StanfordWho will show a Stanford stock image.
Note: The web interface view is described on this page. The mobile view interface looks slightly different but has the same features.
How to search for someone in the updated Public view

Go to StanfordWho. Enter a name, email address, work phone number, or SUNet ID in the dialog box. As you enter the information, StanfordWho's search algorithm suggests people you might be looking for in a drop-down list.

Either select the correct name from the drop-down list or press Enter to see all results on an expanded search screen.

If you select a name from the drop-down list, the Public view for that name appears.

This view only includes information that the person has chosen to make public by managing their visibility settings in StanfordYou (faculty, staff, and sponsored affiliates) or Axess (students). Depending on the person's visibility settings, public StanfordWho information may include a photo, name, role, and contact information.
Note:  If you choose to make no information public, no results will appear in StanfordWho public searches.

To return to the StanfordWho landing page, select Stanford Directory in the upper left corner of the page. To see the restricted Stanford and Affiliates view for the name you chose, select Log in.


If you press Enter, an expanded search screen appears with more options for that name.

You can filter the results shown on this page by Department and/or Role. 

An alphabetical list of departments appears.

Websites,How to Display Your StanfordWho Profile Photo,"Faculty and staff members can use their Stanford ID card photo or their Stanford Profiles photo in StanfordWho.
If you're a faculty or staff member, set your Stanford ID card image visibility setting in StandfordYou to control which image displays in StanfordWho. ""Private"" is the default Stanford ID card image visibility setting for staff and faculty members. Therefore, no photo will appear in StanfordWho unless you’ve changed the image visibility setting or uploaded a photo in Stanford Profiles.​ 
Here are instructions for how to control which photo displays in StanfordWho:
To display your Stanford ID card photo:

Log into StanfordYou and set your ID Card image visibility setting to ""Public"" or ""Stanford.""
Note: You can update your ID card image online. You’re not required to have a new ID card printed when you update the photo. But if you do, the cost to print a replacement card is $25.

To display your Stanford Profiles photo:

Log into StanfordYou and ensure your Stanford ID Card image visibility setting is set to ""Private.""
Log into  Stanford Profiles and click ""Edit My Profile"" in the upper right side of the page to set your image visibility setting to ""Stanford"" or ""Public.""

To display no photo:

Log into StanfordYou and ensure your ID card setting is ""Private.""
Note: If you have a photo uploaded in Stanford Profiles, it will display in StanfordWho with these settings.


Each night, University IT will send images with a visibility setting of Stanford or Public to StanfordWho. Depending upon the image visibility settings, these images will then display in the Stanford and/or Public view(s) of the StanfordWho directory.
To keep the systems aligned, we strongly encourage you to upload the same photo you’ve uploaded in Stanford Profiles to your Stanford ID card. Just keep in mind any photo you submit for your ID card must meet certain requirements, which are listed on the ID card photo submission webpage.  If you would like to upload an image to or update your Stanford Profile, simply navigate to profiles.stanford.edu, and click on the ""Edit My Profile"" option in the upper right side of the page."

Public and restricted views
The default mode of StanfordWho is ""public"" — this is the view that the general public can see, and includes only those people who have chosen to make their listing public.
Members of the Stanford community, including affiliated organizations such as Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children's Health, can log in to the restricted view. This view includes more people, and individual listings often include more information than the public view.
To search the Stanford- and Affiliates-only directory, you must have an active SUNet ID and academic or administrative privileges. Most people who are listed in the directory can log in to the Stanford view, with some exceptions (e.g., incoming students not yet on campus).
You can access the Stanford-only view directly.
Visibility and privacy settings
Each person's listing in the Stanford directory is governed by visibility and privacy settings they control, either via Axess (for students) or via StanfordYou (for staff and faculty).
Note for Students: See the Directory Information page for a list of items regarded as directory information according to the Office of the University Registrar.
Faculty and staff can choose whether to be listed in public view, the Stanford-only view, or unlisted (private). Students can be in the public view or unlisted.
If your directory preference is:
public: your listing will appear in both the public view of the directory and the Stanford-only view. Anyone can find you—but only by searching for the specific information you have made available to the directory.Stanford: your listing will not appear in the public view of the directory, no matter what kind of search is performed. In the Stanford view, your listing will appear with an indicator to show that you are not listed in the public directory. This helps the searcher see who has been added to the results list by searching the Stanford-only directory, and serves as a reminder to not disclose your information outside the Stanford community.private: your listing will not appear in either the public or the Stanford- and Affiliates only view. No matter what kind of search is performed, your information will not be included in any results set. Note that this usually includes the printed annual directory, unless your organization chooses to override settings through Organization Manager."

Websites,Class Email List,"Class email lists enable you to send announcements easily to everyone associated with your class. When you register for Email Announcement Lists, University IT creates an e-mail distribution list of all your students (along with three other email lists described below). This student list is kept up-to-date automatically, using current enrollment data from the Registrar, so you won’t have to subscribe or unsubscribe students as they add or drop the class. Please note that students’ ""@stanford.edu"" email addresses are the ones used for University IT class email lists. Students who use another account as a primary email address will need to forward the @stanford.edu address to the preferred address using StanfordYou.

Websites,Class Disk Space,"University IT Course Support includes 500MB of space for you to store and share syllabi, web files, course outlines, problem sets, notes, essays, etc. Your class space is located in the University’s AFS distributed file system. Along with serving as a data storage, file sharing, and Web hosting environment, AFS enables cooperating hosts (clients and servers) to efficiently share file system resources across both local area and wide are networks. All of the materials you store in AFS are backed up regularly by University IT. Your space is located and named according to a straightforward labeling system and file structure, making it easy to find and work with. (Example: /afs/ir/class/<name of your class here>.)
If the standard 500MB isn’t adequate for your class directory, you can request more when you register or via email to courses@stanford.edu. You can also request that University IT allocate additional space to your students’ personal directories to accommodate assignments or other work they may need to share with you or their classmates. Just look for the additional space options on the Registration/Renewal Form or send an email request to courses@stanford.edu.
What happens to my stored data when the course is over?
If you happen to be teaching the same course the subsequent quarter and want your materials to stay in place, then you’ll need to renew the course registration using the same form you used to register the course initially. If you are not teaching the class in the subsequent quarter, you don’t need to do a thing: the contents of the class directory are archived automatically at the end of the term.
AFS Class Archive Details

Background
AFS is a distributed file system based on client/server architecture. AFS joins together multiple server machine file systems. An AFS cell is grouping of client/server machines which is administered by a domain. Stanford’s administrative domain is named “ir.stanford.edu” — which at Stanford can be abbreviated to just “ir.” Directories and files relevant to the classes you’re teaching or have taught in the past are stored under /afs/ir/class/archive. You can learn more about AFS and how it’s organized by visiting AFS at Stanford.
AFS Storage
Your AFS storage space is divided into volumes, each of which contains a set of related directories and file. People access these volumes via “mount points”: special file elements that indicate which volumes should be associated with which directories. Volumes can be placed anywhere in AFS by using a mount point, and will then appear as a directory. For example, the files for the class EE118 taught in 2003 exist in a volume named class.ee118.1034. To access these files through AFS, that volume is mounted. Typically a mount point would created at /afs/ir/class/ee182. Under that directory will be the contents of the class.ee182.1032 volume.
How It Works
In AFS, Stanford's class directories can be found under:
/afs/ir/class/archive/
and are further subdivided, by volume, as follows:
subject/subjectnumber/subjectnumber.qtr
For example, class materials for Computer Science 147b, which is offered during autumn quarter of 2004-2005, can be accessed by the following mount point:
/afs/ir/class/archive/cs/cs147b/cs147b.1052
(The number 1052 is the PeopleSoft code for autumn 2004-2005.) In addition to the above mount point, an additional mount point for the currently active quarter is created under /afs/ir/class. In this case, there would be an additional mount point at /afs/ir/class/cs147b. These are just two mount points, two names, for the same volume and the same files; the contents of the directories:
/afs/ir/class/archive/cs/cs147b/cs147b.1052
and
/afs/ir/class/cs147b
would be absolutely identical, changes made in one location would be automatically reflected in the other location.
How Materials are Retained Year After Year
When a new quarter begins, at your request, a class system administrator will create a new volume. That volume can be a clone of the old volume or an empty volume. Using the example above, where the PeopleSoft code for winter is 1054, this material would then be found under /afs/ir/class/archive/cs/cs147b/cs147b.1054. The mount point for /afs/ir/class/cs147b is moved to point to the new volume. No class materials are deleted or moved. Only the mount points are moved. “Archiving,” then, is really just a process of moving mount points and is typically done quarterly. In addition to the above process, a nightly backup is performed on all volumes in AFS. For more information on AFS, please see AFS at Stanford."
Websites,Why can't links on Stanford Sites open in a new tab or window?,"Due to accessibility and usability concerns, Stanford Sites websites are configured so that links will not open in a new browser window (or tab.) 
When a link opens in a new window while a user is on a smartphone or a tablet, they can no longer use the back button to navigate. This is an issue on desktops as well. We call this ""breaking the back button."" 
Opening new windows or tabs also causes issues with screen readers as the announcement that the browser is opening in a new window is easily missed by the user.
Instead, users can control this behavior themselves by using cmd-click(MacOS) or ctrl-click(Windows) to open new tabs, if desired.

Websites,Retire Your WordPress Site,"UIT is modernizing content management systems and moving to the cloud. As a result, WordPress on AFS will not be available for new sites as of May 1, 2021. WordPress on Stanford Domains is the recommended solution for individuals and groups interested in creating personal or collaborative sites using WordPress. For official department websites or those with more complex needs, Stanford Sites is the primary content management system. Additional information can be found on the WCMS WordPress Hosting project page.
If you no longer need your site and would like to delete it, you may be tempted to just remove the files from AFS. That frees up space from your AFS directory, but it does not delete the database that WordPress was using to store its content, nor does it clear the record from the installer (if you installed it using the WordPress installer).
The best way to delete your site is to submit a Help Request.
In your request, mention the location of your site (your group or department name, and the subdirectory where you installed WordPress, e.g., /group/group-name/cgi-bin/blog). University IT will then delete the record from the installer, and free up the database. If you want to keep a backup of your WordPress site, make sure to copy it before you contact University IT to have it deleted, or ask University IT to provide you with a copy.
Make a final backup
To keep a backup of your WordPress site before you have it deleted, you need two things:
a copy of the WordPress filesa recent backup of the database
You can find both of these in AFS (the file system where they are stored). The WordPress files are in the directory where WordPress was originally installed. Databases are backed up daily in the early morning and stored in a special directory called db_private at the root of your group or department AFS space. 
For example, for a WordPress site installed for the department of History in a subdirectory called blog:
The files are found in /afs/ir/dept/history/cgi-bin/blogThe database backups are found in /afs/ir/dept/history/db_private/
Database backups are named after your group or department and include the word ""wordpress"" in them to distinguish them from other database backups. In case your department or group has more than one WordPress site installed, a number is appended to the filename as well (e.g., wordpress1, wordpress2, etc.)
The filename includes sql (the extension for database backups) and a number from 0 to 3. The latest backup uses the number 0. Finally, the backup is compressed and has an extension of .gz
So, the latest backup for the department of history's first WordPress site would be called d_history_wordpress1.sql.0.gz. The latest backup for third WordPress site for the tennis group would be called g_tennis_wordpress3.sql.0.gz
To make a backup of your WordPress site's files and database use either SFTP or OpenAFS to connect to your group or departments AFS space and download the files to a safe place.
If you have any trouble identifying which database backup to use, or can't find the location of the files, make sure to ask for a backup of the site when submitting your Help request.

Sometimes you are handed a WordPress site to manage, but don't have full access to it. There are two kinds of administrative access to a WordPress site:
Access to an administrator account on the site itself.Access to the group or department web space where the WordPress software is installed.
Each access method provides the ability to perform different tasks.
WordPress administrator: make content upgrades, upgrade WordPress software, maintain users, or manage comments
A WordPress Administrator is someone who has access to the Admin Panel within WordPress and can perform tasks from within the site itself, such as make content upgrades, upgrade WordPress software, add users or manage comments. 
The best way to obtain this type of access is from a person who's already an administrator of the website, such as the person that originally installed WordPress. They can create a new account for you or promote your existing account to one with administrative privileges.
Group or department web space administrator: install WordPress
While you might be a WordPress administrator, you might still not have administration rights to the underlying web space that hosts WordPress. This is required if you need to install more instances of WordPress, or if you need to install or upgrade plugins and themes manually (if they can't be updated through WordPress itself).

*Note that the newer versions of WordPress require a hosting environment that supports recent versions of PHP and MySQL, and Stanford's AFS environment eventually will not meet those requirements; as a result, websites built using WordPress on AFS may not function as expected. Additional information can be found on the WCMS WordPress Hosting project page.

Websites,Keep Your WordPress Site Secure,"UIT is modernizing content management systems and moving to the cloud. As a result, WordPress on AFS will not be available for new sites as of May 1, 2021. WordPress on Stanford Domains is the recommended solution for individuals and groups interested in creating personal or collaborative sites using WordPress. For official department websites or those with more complex needs, Stanford Sites is the primary content management system. Additional information can be found on the WCMS WordPress Hosting project page.
There are lots of reasons why people might want to compromise your WordPress site. They range from simple mischief (“look, I hacked into Stanford and my name is now on their web page!”), to financial reasons (“I can now use the site to send out tons of spam through Stanford’s servers and get paid for it by my clients”). Even if all of your content is public, your site is still a target and it’s your responsibility to keep it as secure as possible.
To help keep your site secure, make sure that you:
Upgrade the software regularly through the WordPress Upgrader.Don’t allow people to self-register and become admins.Use strong passwords.Use WebAuth, if possible, for logging in.Set AFS permissions correctly (AFS is the file system where your data is stored).Retire the site properly when you no longer need or use it.
Keep the code up-to-date
WordPress is a secure platform to begin with, but as time goes by hackers discover bugs they can exploit to break into your site. Therefore, it's very important to keep the software up-to-date when new versions of WordPress and its plugins are released. See Keep your WordPress site up-to-date.
New users
WordPress can allow anyone to register and create an account on the site. This is great if you want new subscribers to be able to create their own accounts, follow your blog and you have time to monitor new users. Unfortunately, this feature can be exploited by spammers who use these accounts as a foothold for trying to break into your site. If you don't have time to monitor your site and delete spammer accounts, you may want to prevent users from creating their own accounts.
Prevent users from creating new accounts on their own
In the Admin Panel, select Settings > General and verify that the Membership - Anyone can register option is unchecked.
If you are using WebAuth for authentication of new users, only Stanford users will be able to create accounts, which is much safer. However, if you still want to prevent new users from having accounts on the site, in the Admin Panel, select Settings > HTTP Authentication and uncheck Automatically create accounts?
Verify the role is correct
New accounts automatically receive a default role. You should verify that the role is the correct one. At install time, the default role new users receive is that of Subscriber, which allows them to create an account and read the blog, but nothing else.
To verify the default role visit the Admin Panel for your site, select Settings > General and verify that Subscriber is the value for New User Default Role.
Strong Passwords
If you are using local WordPress accounts for administration, make sure that you set strong passwords. If your password is weak, it’s just a matter of time before one of the automated password-guessers running around the internet find it. Stanford’s web servers are probed thousands of times a day.
For advice on choosing a strong password, see SUNet ID Passwords.
Use WebAuth for user authentication
WordPress installed through the WordPress Installer comes with a plugin, called ""HTTP Authentication"" which integrates WebAuth with WordPress, allowing you to log in using through Weblogin using your regular SUNet ID and password. It’s more secure, and there is one fewer password to remember.
When you installed WordPress, you would have been given the option for WebAuth. If you didn't select it at that time, and would like to enable it after the installation is completed, please submit a Help request.
AFS permissions / file system security
You’ll also want to make sure that the permissions for the WordPress software files installed on AFS (Stanford's distributed file system) are set up correctly. If they are not, they could allow someone else to read your database password, or they could allow someone to write malicious software or modify your files to gain access to the software application.
The correct permissions are set up at install time by the WordPress Installer. If you'd like to double-check, the easiest way to do so is through WebAFS, the Web interface to Stanford's distributed files system called AFS.
Visit https://afs.stanford.edu and under Current AFS Directory Path enter your group or department's cgi-bin directory. For example, for the history department, the correct directory would be /afs/ir/dept/history/cgi-bin. For a group called opensource, the correct directory would be /afs/ir/group/opensource/cgi-bin.

Select the directory where the blog is installed and click on Set Permissions for Folder.

A list of permissions for the folder will be shown. The correct permissions are:
-admins group: all permissionssystem:dept-admin: all permissionssystem:backup: lookup and readsystem:www-servers: lookup and readsystem:administrators: all permissionsservice.tools: lookup and readyour group or department's .cgi: all permissions except admin

 
When it’s time, retire the site
If you no longer need your WordPress website, you should retire it so that it doesn’t become abandoned software. See the Retire your WordPress Site section of this guide.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Sponsored Services,"The following services can be sponsored with Sponsorship Manager:

Account

Base account (SUNet ID)
Full account (SUNet ID and email)


Email service for a department or function

Account (SUNet ID, email)
A sponsored SUNet ID is available to anyone who is not part of the core Stanford community (students, faculty, staff) as long as this person uses computing resources in support of legitimate University work. SUNet IDs can be sponsored for contractors and consultants, temporary staff, visiting faculty, and others.
A person can have only one SUNet ID, through either sponsorship or university eligibility. It's possible (though unnecessary) to sponsor a university-eligible person's SUNet ID; simply, no charges will accrue to the sponsor's PTA until the sponsored person's university-eligible status ends. Not all services available to university-eligible SUNet IDs are available to sponsored SUNet IDs.
How to sponsor a SUNet ID account
To sponsor an account for someone, follow the steps below.Note: You must be a faculty member, manager, or have been expressly granted the privilege to sponsor.

On the Sponsorship dashboard, click Sponsor a SUNet ID > Sponsor a person.
Select the service level — either a base (no email) or full (email and services).
Enter a start and end date for the sponsorship. The maximum duration allowed is one year.
Search for the person who needs a SUNet ID.

If the person's SUNet ID or University ID is found in Sponsorship Manager, click Sponsor to activate the account.
If the person doesn't have a SUNet ID or person record, Sponsorship Manager sends an email to the person you want to sponsor asking for identifying information. Once they respond you'll be able to finalize the sponsorship.


For a new account, the sponsored individual will receive an email invitation to create a new SUNet ID at accounts.stanford.edu. The account must be created within 30 days.
The new SUNet ID is activated on the day you indicated as the sponsorship start date. No more action is required of either party.

When a full-service SUNet ID is sponsored, a monthly fee is billed to the PTA you provide;  you must have requisitions authority for the PTA in Oracle Financials. When a base service level is sponsored, no PTA is required.
The SUNet ID is used as the login ID (available to all service levels) to access systems and secure online resources to which it has been specifically allowed, at the discretion of the system owner. These may include:


login to Axess (if the owner was formerly a student)


login to any protected website to which it has been granted access


Email service for a department or function
University departments or functions can be given a special, shared email account. The account name must be 9 characters or longer, e.g., facultyaffairs@stanford.edu. To request a shared email account, please submit a request form. Once the account has been approved and created for you, sponsorship is required to activate it.
If you are the administrator for a shared email account, when you log in to Stanford Accounts and click the Email Management tile, you will see a new tile for Shared Email. There, you can set up email forwarding addresses. To set up an autoreply for a shared email, please visit Manage Autoreply."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Sponsor a Person,"A person record is a record in the Stanford system that contains personally identifiable information such as full name, date of birth, and personal email address of the person being sponsored. Several Stanford systems use the same person record, and duplicate records cause severe service interruptions such as delayed paychecks, no email access, and ineligibility for a campus ID card. A person record must be found or created before someone can be sponsored for a SUNet ID account.
A sponsor must be a faculty member, a manager, or someone who has been given authority to sponsor in Authority Manager. The sponsor and the sponsored person (sponsee) work together to retrieve an existing SUNet ID or create a new one. There are three parts to this process:
Part 1: The sponsor searches the Stanford system to make sure that a person receiving sponsorship doesn't already have a record in the system.  The sponsor can search by SUNet ID, University ID, or at a minimum last name and date of birth. If a record is found, the person can be sponsored immediately for a SUNet ID account.
Part 2: If no record is found, Sponsorship Manager issues an email invitation to the sponsee to provide additional information. When the sponsee replies to the email, the sponsor is notified and the Sponsorship Manager dashboard is updated. The sponsor can then complete the process by either sponsoring an existing SUNet ID or creating a new person record and sponsoring the account.
Part 3: When a new person record is created and sponsored, Sponsorship Manager issues an email invitation to the sponsored person and a confirmation of sponsorship email to the sponsor or their designated contact. The sponsored person follows the link in the invitation email and creates a new SUNet ID.
Part 1: Search for a person in Stanford's systems
Before sponsoring a person for a SUNet ID, you must confirm that they don't already have an active or previously active record in the Stanford system. You can search for a person record by SUNet ID/University ID or by name and date of birth.

Log in to Sponsorship Manager.   
Click Sponsor a Service and then click SUNet ID. 
On the Step 1: Sponsorship details page:

Select the service level and start and end dates.
If you are sponsoring a full-service SUNet ID, enter a current PTA for which you have requisitions authority in Oracle Financials.
If you are sponsoring this person on behalf of someone else, check the I am sponsoring on behalf of box. Enter the SUNet ID of the person you are sponsoring on behalf of.
Add Notes if you wish. 

 
Click Next to search whether the person you wish to sponsor already exists in the system and has a SUNet ID. 
To search by SUNet ID or University ID:

Enter the SUNet ID or University ID in the search box and then click the search icon.
The name associated with the ID displays. If this is the person you wish to sponsor, click Sponsor. 

 
To search by name and date of birth:

Instead of entering a SUNet or University ID, click Don't know.
Enter at least the last name and birthdate of the person you want to sponsor and then click Search. The more information you enter, the more accurate the search results will be.
Several records may be returned that are potential matches. Review the returned records carefully to determine whether one belongs to the person you want to sponsor.
If one of the returned records belongs to the person you wish to sponsor, click Sponsor.
If the search results do not find the person you wish to sponsor, go to Part 2: Create a new person record. 

 
Provide a contact email address for the person you are sponsoring and click Submit. 
Review the contract details. Check the box to agree that the service contract is entered correctly and then click Finish. 
If necessary, the sponsored person can go to accounts.stanford.edu, click the Password Management tile, then click the Forgot Password tile to reset their password.

Part 2: Create a new person record
When you are certain that the person you're sponsoring doesn't already have a person record, create a new record and sponsor their SUNet ID account.

Follow the steps in Part 1 to make sure that the person you're sponsoring doesn't already have a person record or SUNet ID. 
If you can't find a match, Sponsorship Manager will send an email to the person you want to sponsor requesting more identifying information. Enter the sponsee's non-Stanford email address and click Submit.Note: You may not provide an @stanford.edu email address for a base sponsorship, as the sponsee will not have Stanford email service. 
The sponsee receives an email with a link to a form to provide identifying information. The sponsee has 7 days to complete and submit the form. 
The sponsor is notified via email when the sponsee submits the form. 
On the Sponsorship Manager dashboard, click the Invitations tab. Click Review > Review response. 
If you find out that the invitation email is sent to incorrect address, you can cancel the invitation and start over with a new sponsorship.
On the View response and match results screen, click Create person. 
Next, review the sponsorship details and, if you wish, make changes. Then click Next. 
Review the contract details. Check the box to agree that the service contract is entered correctly and then click Finish.

Part 3: Sponsored person creates a SUNet ID
When the person being sponsored receives the invitation email, they should follow the instructions to create a new SUNet ID. If necessary, you and the person being sponsored are sent a reminder email 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the person is sponsored.
If the person being sponsored does not create a SUNet ID within 30 days, the record you created for that person is deleted. You and the person you sponsored will receive a notification email. If you want to sponsor someone after their record is deleted, repeat part 1 and part 2. Someone else may have created a record for that person in the last 30 days, so be sure to search carefully before creating a new record and sponsoring an account."

Account status
Email address
Emergency contacts
SUNet ID
Directory listing
Primary work location


Account status


Why does my functional account show as ""pending""?


The account is pending until it is sponsored. It will become active approximately four hours after it has been sponsored.
If you have not already identified a sponsor, ask a staff or faculty member to go to Sponsorship Manager and sponsor the account.


Email address


Why do some third-party web sites not work without a Stanford email address?


Many third party services assume that everyone with a SUNetID has a Stanford email address. That is not always true; many sponsored SUNetIDs do not come with Stanford email service, and some SUNetIDs keep their email address private.
If you have a Stanford email address, you can fix the problem by changing the visibility level of your email address. If you do not have a Stanford email address, you can fix the problem by providing a third-party email address. The steps to fix either problem are the same.

Log into StanfordYou.
Click Maintain your directory ad AlertSU emergency contact information.
In the SU Contact Info section, click change.
In the Email address section there are two settings to check:

Either select a Stanford email address or enter a third-party email address.
Set your Email visibility to either 'Public' or 'Stanford'.


Save your changes. Changes can take up to an hour to propagate.

Once your email address has been entered, the change will propagate the Stanford Directory service (LDAP).  The next time you log in to a third-party web site using Stanford credentials, your email address will be provided to the third-party. 
For additional help, review the How do I fix it? steps complete with screenshots.


Emergency contacts


How do I update my emergency contact?


To update your emergency contact, you must first add a new emergency contact and “promote” the new contact to be your primary. Once you add and select a new primary contact, you can then delete a former primary contact.
If you have only one emergency contact, and that person is no longer valid or appropriate as a contact for you, select someone else who can be your emergency contact and enter their information in place of your current contact. Accurate emergency contact information is vital in case of personal or campus emergencies.
To add an emergency contact:

Log into StanfordYou.
Click Maintain your external emergency contact information.

To promote an alternate contact to primary contact:

Log into StanfordYou.
Click Maintain your external emergency contact information.
Click make this my primary contact next to the name of the contact.

Next to Emergency contacts, click add new contact and enter the contact information.
Click Save.



Students can find the instructions to add emergency contact here.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Sponsorship Details,"Who can sponsor
Faculty,  managers (as defined by Human Resources), and individuals who have been expressly granted the privilege can sponsor individuals or accounts for services by using Sponsorship Manager, a web application. Anyone with a SUNet ID can view sponsorship information.
Paid services: The sponsor must have requisitions authority in Oracle Financials, and provide a PTA for billing.
The specific authority required is Approvals — Requisitions.This authority must be active — that is, the sponsor has completed all prerequisites and is able to actually approve requisitions in Oracle Financials.
Free services: The sponsor must be a faculty member, manager, or an individual who has been expressly granted the privilege to sponsor.
You can review the list of people and services you currently sponsor by logging into Sponsorship Manager and clicking the As Sponsor tab.
Who can be sponsored
Anyone with a SUNet ID can technically be sponsored for a service. The sponsorship will only be active, however, if the person is not otherwise eligible for the same service via his or her status at the University.
For example:
Student Pat is university-eligible for a full-service SUNet ID because she is an active student.Professor Jean sponsors Pat for a full-service SUNet ID. The sponsorship is not activated because Pat is university-eligible for the same service. No charges accrue.Pat graduates, and is now university-eligible only for base-level service.Jean's sponsorship kicks in, and Pat maintains full SUNet ID service. The PTA Jean provided is now charged monthly for the sponsored service.
Sponsor responsibilities
When sponsoring a person for a new SUNet ID account, you are responsible for ensuring that the person being sponsored doesn't already have an existing record and SUNet ID.As sponsor you must affirm that the individual to be sponsored will use the service or resource in support of legitimate University work (i.e., teaching, research, and administration).You are responsible for ensuring that a sponsored service is used in accordance with the University's policies. See the Administrative Guide policies related to Computing for more information.For paid services, the sponsor must provide a current University PTA, for which the sponsor has active Approvals - Requisitions authority in Oracle Financials. Service fees will be billed monthly to this PTA.You will receive notification of sponsorship status changes, unless you indicated a different sponsorship contact person.
Effective period
A sponsorship is valid for a fixed time period of up to one year, specified by the sponsor. Prior to sponsorship expiration, both the sponsor and the person who is sponsored will receive a reminder (via email) 30 days prior to expiration, and a second notice seven days before expiration. If you are a sponsor, you do not need to wait for these notices to renew a sponsorship.
Note: A person who is sponsored for a base-level account will not receive email notification, because base-level accounts do not include email service. Only the sponsor (or specified contact) will be notified.
Sponsorship on-behalf- of

If you scope the assignment to a leaf-node organization, you choose between ""all projects/awards"" or limiting it more precisely to one or more awards, projects, or tasks."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",What's New in Authority Manager,"We're adding a few new features and a refreshed user interface in the Authority Manager application.
Starting June 21, 2021, you’ll see a refreshed interface and new features in Authority Manager. While there are a number of enhancements, the core functions of viewing, granting, and revoking authority will still look and feel familiar.
More intuitive interface
Upon launching the application, you will find a redesigned homepage, similar to the one shown below. You will be able to use the panels in the center to access the features previously accessed via the “Manage Authority'' section, along with several convenient new features. All of the features that can be accessed from the panels can also be accessed from the left menu icons anywhere in the application.
From the top Help menu in the upper right, you can quickly navigate to instructions or submit a Help request.

View the authority you have
To find your authority in the new interface, simply click the ""My Authority"" panel. You’ll see a page that resembles the current legacy landing page, with newly added filtering and viewing options to help you find what you need quickly. You can view your authority in the “Current Authority'' tab. Navigate to other tabs to find recently revoked authority, proxy settings, and requests that may be waiting for your approval. You’ll also be able to click “Export to Excel'' to export the data into a spreadsheet.

View authority for a person or organization
Just as before, anyone with access to Authority Manager can look up and view somebody else's authority. To view a person’s authority in the new interface, click the Search for a Person/Org/Request panel or icon. Enter the name or SUNet ID of the person whose authority you want to view and click Search.
Similarly, to find the authority of an organization, enter the organization name or 4-character org code. In the organization hierarchy, click the organization to display its authority.

Copy Authority
If you have access to grant authority, you can copy current, revoked, or expired privileges from one person to another. To assist with copying privileges, revoked and expired authority profiles for employees who have left Stanford or moved into new roles remain visible in the system for 360 days.
The ability to copy privileges from one user to another makes onboarding more efficient as you no longer have to start from scratch when creating an authority record. When someone leaves your organization you'll be able to copy the privileges they had, even if the privileges were recently revoked or expired.
To get started, click the Search for Person/Org/Request panel or the magnifying icon from the far left menu to find the person whose privileges you want to copy from. You’ll be able to copy multiple privileges at once or copy one privilege at a time.

Request actions when you don’t have authority
When you want to copy, edit, or revoke privileges but don’t have the necessary grantable authority, you can submit a request and the system will route it to the lowest level grantor for approval. To get started, click the ""Request Authority"" panel or the ""Request Authority"" icon.
You’ll be able to view and manage the requests you’ve initiated by clicking the ""My Requests"" panel or ""My Requests"" icon. You will be able to edit your requests by assigning a new approver or canceling a request.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Why are some organization names or assignment rows in italics in Authority Manager?,"Inactive organization names are shown in italics. Inactive organizations continue to be accessible in Authority Manager, because they may have outstanding accounting or reporting needs that require authority.
Privileges with ""grant-only"" status are shown in italics. The person who has a grant-only privilege is not authorized to actually use the privilege in any business system, but only to grant the privileges to others, so the privilege is effectively inactive.
For example, if a person has a ""grant-only"" approvals privilege, they are not actually authorized to approve transactions, and will not be selected as an approver in the workflow. They can, however, designate other people as approvers by granting the approvals privilege to them."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",What Is Authority Manager?,"Authority Manager is a Stanford-developed web application that allows you to view and grant authority across the many administrative applications on campus. It is designed to allow the right person to grant authority to others in a distributed environment. For each administrative system, an individual may have access to view, enter, or approve privileged information. This access is determined by their authority. Authority Manager is the place to see what authority any person has, or to grant them additional authority.
Authority is granted based on three main criteria: business function, organization, and a specific privilege.

business functionA set of privileges that represent a defined University business activity.Examples: Admissions, Financial Aid, Payroll, Time/Leave.organizationAny department or group in the Official University Org Hierarchy. All privileges are granted in the context of an organization.privilegeA specific task or set of tasks that can be granted to an individual. Privileges are self-contained — for example, the ""administer leave"" privilege covers all the data and tasks required to do that job, in all affected business systems.limitPrivileges of different types can be limited by projects, awards, dollar amounts, populations, careers, and so on, to tailor the authority to the specific individual.

Some important points to remember are:
You can grant only the authority you've been given as grantable, up to the limits and conditions set for you.Having authority doesn't necessarily mean you can access the related administrative systems — your authority must be active. Inactive authority may be:
pending prerequisites (such as training you must complete), orgrant-only (such as a task you manage but don't do yourself).
Your pre-selected views show you your authority, your authority-granting proxies, and org views for the top-level organization(s) where you hold grantable authority.You can look at a view for any person or organization in the university using the tools on the Authority Manager home page.
Oracle Financials users
Oracle Financials allows both vacation delegation (selecting someone to act on your behalf for a specified period of time) and the ability to give someone access to your Worklist (typically, to allow colleagues with similar authority to act for each other at any time, or for emergency backup) as explained on the FinGate website."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship","When I assign authority in Authority Manager, what happens in Oracle Financials, PeopleSoft, and other business systems?","When you make any authority change in Authority Manager, an event is posted to a queue. Consumers of authority information check the queue periodically. If a new event is of interest to the consumer system, it will collect the authority document referenced by the event, and update the authority in their system to match it.
Example: Jane Doe is given financial approvals authority for a new project. Authority Manager posts an event to the queue, and updates Jane's authority document. All consumer systems can see the event in the queue, but this particular event is of interest only to Oracle Financials, which collects Jane's authority document and updates her Oracle authority.
Depending on the consumer system, changes take effect in near real-time (ranging from a few minutes to an hour) to next business day."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Why can't I edit or revoke an assignment in Authority Manager?,"Generally speaking, you can edit or revoke any assignment that you could also grant. Even if you were the original grantor of an assignment, if you cannot now grant the same privilege, for the same organization (or its parent), with the same (or more) limits and conditions, you will not be able to edit or revoke that assignment."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship","Why is the ""can grant "" choice sometimes unavailable when I assign authority in Authority Manager?","If you grant a financial privilege that's limited to a selected principal owner, the ""can grant"" choice will not be available. Selecting a principal owner means you're granting authority for all current and future projects and tasks owned by that principal owner. Only people who have ""all projects & tasks"" authority can extend authority limited to a principal owner."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Who can be granted authority in Authority Manager? Where do sponsored SUNet IDs fit in?,"The Stanford academic and administrative communities define the group of people who can:

If a person's status changes so that they are no longer a member of these communities (they leave Stanford; their SUNet ID sponsorship expires; etc.), their authority will be automatically revoked."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",What happens in Authority Manager when someone leaves the University?,"When their PeopleSoft HR status changes, the authority registry is notified, and their authority is automatically revoked. The affected business systems are notified in turn, and the person's access to those systems is closed. The person(s) who granted the now-revoked authority will be notified by email. (If the original grantor is no longer available, the notification will be sent to the Help Desk to determine whether any further action is required.)
When someone is laid off, their authority is not not always automatically revoked. We recommend that authority be manually revoked."

This feature allows you to designate someone to grant authority on your behalf, without giving them your actual authority, or your access to administrative systems. This feature is especially useful for high-level users to delegate the business of granting authority to an administrative associate. The person you select does not need to have any other type of authority.
An example for using authority-granting proxy
The senior associate dean of a school holds all of the financial approval authority for the school. When a new department manager joins the school, he must be assigned financial approval authority over his accounts. The senior associate dean doesn't have time to take care of it, but she has granted authority-granting proxy to her administrative associate. Upon instruction from the senior associate dean, the administrative associate is able to give the department manager the necessary financial authority through Authority Manager, even though the administrative associate does not have authority to approve expenditures for those accounts.

The details column lists the projects to which each privilege applies — either ""All projects & tasks"" or a list of specific projects and/or tasks. If the Organization view is very long, use the browser's Find feature (Ctrl-F or Command-F) to search for the project or task number.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Copy Authority,"These instructions reflect a new interface and features rolled out to Authority Manager on June 21, 2021. To view a recorded demo on navigating the new interface, visit the Authority Manager Enhancements project page.
If you have access to grant authority, you can copy current, revoked, or expired privileges from one person to another. 
The ability to copy privileges from one user to another makes onboarding more efficient as you no longer have to start from scratch to grant authority. When someone leaves your organization, you can copy over the privileges that they had, even if the privileges were recently revoked or expired.
Revoked and expired authority profiles for employees who have left Stanford or moved into new roles remain visible in the system for 360 days.You’ll be able to copy multiple privileges at once or copy one privilege at a time. If you copy privileges individually, you have the ability to edit the privilege.
Copy Current Authority
If you have grantable authority over the selected privileges, a copy will be performed immediately. Otherwise, a separate request will be created for each privilege and managed from the Requests tile.

From the Authority Manager homepage, click the Search for Person/Org/Request tile or the magnifying icon from the far left menu.


Enter the SUNet ID (preferred) or name of the person whose privileges you would like to copy from.

Go to the user's Current Authority tab and locate the privilege(s) you would like to copy. 

Click the Actions button to the right of the privilege name and choose Copy Privilege.

Search for the Grantee to copy to in the Select the person to be granted authority field

Click Grant Authority​

Copy Multiple Privileges
It’s important to note that copying multiple roles at the same time does not provide the ability to modify any of them. For example, you are unable to copy all of the roles given to one budget officer and simply change the org code for all privileges to grant to a different budget officer.  If you want to make changes, you should copy the privileges one by one instead. 

 From the Authority Manager homepage, click the Search for Person/Org/Request tile or the magnifying icon from the far left menu.

Enter the SUNet ID (preferred) or name of the person whose privileges you would like to copy from.

Go to the user's Current Authority or Recently Revoked Authority tab and click the checkboxes on the far right next to the privileges you would like to copy. 

From the Request dropdown menu, click Copy Privilege.

This feature allows you to designate someone to grant authority on your behalf, without giving them your actual authority, or your access to administrative systems. This feature is especially useful for high-level users to delegate the business of granting authority to an administrative associate. The person you select does not need to have any other type of authority.
An example for using authority-granting proxy
The senior associate dean of a school holds all of the financial approval authority for the school. When a new department manager joins the school, he must be assigned financial approval authority over his accounts.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How can I find an inactive organization when it's no longer listed in the hierarchy in Authority Manager?,"To find an inactive organization in Authority Manager, it helps to know its four-character org code (also called Admin ID). Use the Find an Organization tool, or the search box in the Grant wizard to search for the organization by its name, or its 4-character code.
Inactive organizations that have existing authority assignments will appear in Person and Business Function views, in italics."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Can anyone see the authority I have in Authority Manager?,"Anyone in the Stanford academic and administrative communities (i.e. anyone who is eligible to receive authority) can access Authority Manager and view authority for any person or organization. The authority itself is not considered private information, though it is restricted to the Stanford community.

In the Manage Authority section, click Find an Organization.Enter the organization name or 4-character org code.In the drop-down list, click the org code/name of the organization whose authority you want to view.In the organization hierarchy, click the organization name to display its authority."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Authority Manager Terminology,"Authority Manager lets you view, grant, and revoke systems authority to persons whose job requires them to access Stanford business systems. You grant a privilege to an eligible person and set scope, limits, and conditions on the privilege. The result is recorded as an assignment. Some privileges have prerequisites (such as training) that the recipient must complete before the assignment can take effect.
Privileges are grouped into business functions, which roughly represent a defined business activity. Business functions are grouped into authority subsystems to help differentiate similar functions.
ASSIGNMENT
Each time a grantor goes through the Grant Authority wizard, it results in one new row in the recipient's Person view. Each row represents one assignment. An assignment consists of:
a grantora recipienta business functionan organizationa privilegenone, one, or several limits, depending on how the privilege has been definedan expiration conditiona ""grantable"" condition (which determines whether the recipient can, in turn, grant this authority)a start-date (if specified)
If the grantor selects more than one population, project, task, etc., all the other elements of the assignment apply equally to each of the selections.
For example, if the grantor selects two projects in the same assignment, the same spending limit will apply to both projects. If the projects require different spending limits, they must be granted separately with different spending limits.AUTHORITY-GRANTING PROXY
A person you designate in Authority Manager to grant authority on your behalf. That person can act as you in Authority Manager to grant any authority that you yourself can grant, but cannot act as you in any Stanford business systems.
AUTHORITY SUBSYSTEM
Authority subsystems are loosely equivalent to University business offices and the business systems that support them.
Financial Systems GL — Oracle FinancialsHuman Resources — PeopleSoft HR, WorkflowStudent Systems and Data — PeopleSoft Student Admin
In Authority Manager, lists of business functions are grouped by authority subsystem to help distinguish between similar functions in different business areas, e.g., financial approvals and HR approvals.
BUSINESS FUNCTION
A set of privileges that represents a defined University business activity.
Examples: Purchasing, Admissions, Payroll
Financial Systems GL = authority subsystem :. Approvals, Purchasing = business functionsHuman Resources = authority subsystem; Payroll :. Time and Leave = business functionsStudent Systems and Data = authority subsystem :. Admissions, Financial Aid = business functions
CONDITION
An individual must meet specified conditions to have systems authority. They must be a current member of the Stanford community (staff, faculty, student), and must have met any prerequisites attached to the privilege. A manager can set a future start date if they wish to activate the authority later. A manager can also set an expiration date when the authority will be automatically revoked (or renewed by the manager).
ELIGIBLE PERSON
Authority can be granted to anyone in the Stanford administrative or academic communities. These include:
all regular facultyall regular staffcasual/temporary staffinstructional staffdepartment-sponsored IDs (contractors, consultants, temporary help, etc.)in some cases current students
​​If a person has authority, and their status changes so that they are no longer a member of these communities, their authority will be automatically revoked. Only members of these communities can log into Authority Manager to view or grant authority.​
​GRANT
The act of assigning authority that you have been authorized to extend to others. You can be authorized in two ways:
Someone has granted you authority with the ""can extend"" condition.Someone has made you their authority-granting proxy, and they have authority with the ""can extend"" condition.
LIMIT
Some privileges apply only within the projects, populations, dollar amounts, etc. specified by the grantor — these are collectively referred to as ""limits."" Some privileges are, by their nature, unlimited.
If a privilege has limits defined, they are displayed in the Grant wizard in Authority Manager allowing the user to make the choices for each limit. Some limits allow more than one selection. All limits require at least one selection.
Student Systems and Data
admit center (1 or more)item type (1 or more and ranges allowed)
Financial Systems GL
project (1 or more; or ""all"")task (1 or more; or ""all"")award (1 or more; or ""all"")principal owner (1 only)spending limit (1 only)

NOTIFICATION
Authority Manager sends email notifications to grantors and recipients of authority for various reasons, including:
new authority grantedauthority limits or conditions changedprerequisites to be met, with a reminder after 14 daysauthority condition will expire in 30 days, with a reminder at 7 daysauthority condition has expiredassignments of authority-granting proxy or acting approverreminders when acting approver starts and ends
Wherever possible, notifications of a given type are combined into one daily email. Some situations (such as an acting approver assignment that starts immediately) trigger an immediate notification.
NOTIFICATION FOR REQUESTS
Authority Manager sends email notifications for different types of authority requests to grantors, requesters, FYI contacts and grantees of authority, including:
new authority request submitted to copy/edit/revokeauthority request reassigned to the new approverauthority request approved/deniedauthority request canceled
​ORGANIZATION
Any department or group in the official University structure. All privileges are granted in the context of an organization; a manager can grant authority only within her own organization and its sub-organizations.
Note that the organization applies to the privilege, not the recipient of the authority.Example: A director might grant some authority for a project owned by her organization to a person in another organization.
PREREQUISITE
Some privileges have requirements (successful completion of training, signature on file, etc.) that must be met by the individual before the privilege can take effect.
When a prerequisite is completed, the individual is added to a special workgroup, and Authority Manager is notified to activate the pending authority.
PRIVILEGE
A specific task or set of tasks that can be granted to an individual. Privileges are self-contained — for example, the ""administer leave"" privilege covers all the data and tasks required to do that job, in all affected business systems.
Financial Systems GL<--authority subsystem: . . Approvals<--business function : . . Labor Distribution<--privileges : . . RequisitionsHuman Resources<--authority subsystem: . . Approvals<--business function : . . Faculty Affairs Approver<--privileges : . . Human Resources ApproverStudent Systems & Data<--authority subsystem: . . Admissions<--business function : . . Basic Prospect/Applicant<--privileges : . . Enhanced Prospect/Applicant
RESTORE
The ability to reinstate authority by individual privilege. You can only restore those privileges that you can grant.
REVOKE
The act of removing authority. You can only remove authority that you have been authorized to extend to others.
SCOPE
The organization to which an authority assignment applies.
SYSTEMS AUTHORITY
Access to the portions of Stanford business systems that contain data or tasks related to a specified privilege.
SYSTEM OWNER
Individuals who have any grantable privilege scoped to Stanford University are system owners for the authority subsystem that includes that privilege.

Steps to complete training
This section gives an overview of how your prerequisite status flows through the university business systems, and how soon you can expect your authority to be activated.

You complete the prerequisite.

You can complete prerequisites before or after the authority is granted. You will receive a reminder email if you haven't completed a prerequisite after 14 days. (After 300 days, any pending authority for which you still have not completed prereqs will be invalidated. You will need the authority revoked and granted again.)
Register in STARS to complete most training.
Clarify with your manager or the person granting you authority what course to take.


A person or an automated process records your status.

Online/self-paced or classroom training: In most cases, STARS updates your completed status automatically. Updates are posted four times daily, between 9:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m.
Signature required: On receipt of your signed confidentiality agreement, Controller’s Office staff update your completed status. OR on receipt of your certificate of completion, AS staff update your completed status.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Authority Setup Utility,"Bulk load specification and process
The team for the business system area will complete all of the NEW authority setup in UAT before proceeding. This must be done using the Authority Manager setup Apex application.

A system area team member will then use the Grant Super User to grant the newly created authority setup to a SUNet ID— i.e., hennessy or some other appropriate initial grantor.
This team will then create tab-delimited input files for all assignments which are to be bulk loaded.
Bulk loading of initial assignments into Authority Manager UAT can then be completed using the  Bulk Load Authority.
Once the authority setup is ready to be moved to production the MaIS team will export the setup from UAT and import it into production
The MaIS team will then use the Grant Super User to grant the newly created authority setup to a SUNet ID— i.e., hennessy or some other appropriate initial grantor.
The last step is that the MaIS team will use the tab-delimited file to complete the production bulk load.

File Requirements
	1. The tab-delimited file should contain one row per authority assignment.
	2. The file should contain the following columns of data for each row in the order specified:
		2.1. grantor (one of the following)
				university id (univid) of the grantor of authority
				SUNet id (sunetid) of the grantor of authority
				registry object id (roid) of the grantor of authority

Overview
Choosing a SUNet ID
Services
Eligibility
Base Services
Authority
Activation


Overview
The SUNet ID is an account name that identifies you, uniquely and permanently, as a member of the Stanford community. It is recorded in Stanford business systems and is visible to university employees. It's what you'll use to log into most secure online services. Your SUNet ID and password supply your online credentials; your access to specific online services is determined by your eligibility and authority.
Ownership of a SUNet ID is governed by university policy as expressed in Administrative Guide 64.
Choosing a SUNet ID
Your SUNet ID is:

permanently assigned to you. Once you've claimed a SUNet ID, it will never be reassigned. You cannot easily change your SUNet ID.
not private. You can control whether it is displayed in Stanford's online directory and you can create an alias to use as your email address, but your actual SUNet ID will remain visible in university business systems and reports and may be requested as an identifier by university staff.
not anonymous. Your SUNet ID is directly associated with you, unlike a social network ID or email address that may mask your identity.

As your relationship with Stanford changes — through graduation, employment, retirement, etc. — the status of your SUNet ID will change from active to inactive and back, but your SUNet ID itself does not change.
This means that a great many SUNet IDs are reserved but not currently active. In addition, StanfordYou allows you to create two SUNet ID aliases to use as alternate email/web addresses. Once an alias becomes inactive, it is reserved for at least two years, during which time it can be re-used only by its original owner.
As a result, you may be required to select a SUNet ID that is not your first choice, even though the one you want may not be currently in use.
Don't let your frustration with not getting the SUNet ID you want lead you to select one you'll later regret. Choose one you'll be confident to say aloud to your manager, professor, or colleagues.
We understand that you cannot foresee life changes that may make your SUNet ID inappropriate after the fact. Therefore, in extremely rare cases a request to change a SUNet ID may be approved. Changing a SUNet ID requires substantial effort from several different campus offices, and can result in disruption of your services during the transition.

Eligibility
Once you have a SUNet ID and password, you may be eligible for a package of Stanford online services that includes email, AFS, and web hosting. Services may be turned on or off as your eligibility changes.
There are two types of eligibility for SUNet services:

University-eligible: you automatically receive services because of your status at the university
Sponsored: an authorized university employee has agreed to extend services to you for a fixed period of timeSee the Sponsorship service page for more information.

Service ""packages"" are defined as:

Base

SUNet ID (login ID)
directory listing in StanfordWho(more about what you can do with base services, below)


Full (sponsored) = base services plus:

email service
Web service
AFS storage space
email list service


Full (University-eligible) = all above services plus:

free or discounted software



If you have a SUNet ID, but are neither University-eligible for services nor sponsored for a service package, your SUNet ID is considered inactive and can't be used for anything.
Base services
The base service level means that you have an entry in the Stanford directory (StanfordWho) and can be recognized and identified by your SUNet ID and password. Individual services may grant you access based on your identity. At a minimum, you can:

login to Axess (recent alumni only)
login to StanfordYou to maintain your contact information for your directory listing
login via WebLogin to any protected web site to which your SUNet ID has been given specific access via a workgroup or access control list

Examples of some of the things you can (and cannot) do with a base-level SUNet ID:

Recent alumni (for five years after graduation) can log into axess.stanford.edu to request a transcript or change their address. No sponsorship required.


If your SUNet ID has been granted access to a secure Stanford website, you'll be able to log into that website via your browser. Sponsorship may be required, if you're not otherwise eligible for base service.


You cannot maintain your own Stanford website or FTP files to any Stanford website, regardless of the access control lists for that website.


If someone grants a temporary employee authority to do tasks in Oracle Financial Systems, that person will be able to to log into Oracle Financials. No sponsorship required.


If someone grants a regular employee authority to do tasks in Oracle Financial Systems after that person leaves Stanford (rare, but possible), that person will be able to to log into Oracle Financials until that authority expires. Sponsorship required.

Authority
A person with a SUNet ID can be assigned authority to do specific tasks in Stanford's business systems. This authority is independent of that person's eligibility for other online services.
For example, a temporary staff person who is eligible only for a base-level SUNet ID might be granted authority to do some registration tasks in PeopleSoft Student Administration. That temp staffer would not have Stanford email or other services that come with a full SUNet ID, but would be able to log into PeopleSoft SA to do their work.
For more information about authority and how it is managed at Stanford, see the Authority Manager page.
Service activation
If you are on campus and are University-eligible for a full-service SUNet ID, your services — including email — will be activated within four to six hours of sponsorship.
Otherwise, activation of services may take longer, from a few days to several months.

Contingent students. Base services will be active as soon as you get your SUNet ID. Full services will be activated within 24 hours of your official acceptance of Stanford's admittance offer.
Graduate students. Base services will be active as soon as you get your SUNet ID. Full services for all incoming graduate students are activated on a date determined by the Registrar each year; this date typically falls in late summer.
Individuals requiring sponsorship. No services can be activated until your SUNet ID is sponsored by Stanford faculty or staff. Contact your departmental administrator to request sponsorship. The service level selected by the sponsor will be activated within four to six hours of sponsorship (if sponsorship begins immediately), or at midnight on a future date specified by the sponsor."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Create and Delete Workgroups in Workgroup Manager,"Create a workgroup
All Stanford community members with active SUNet IDs can create personal groups with their ~sunetid stem. To create a group with an organizational stem, you must be a designated maintainer for that stem. 
If you know a stem exists, and you need to be able to create and maintain groups with that stem, please submit a Help ticket. Also, submit a Help ticket if you need a new stem created for a group or project.
University IT recommends that the stem be more than eight characters. It should also be limited to alpha and numeric characters, underscores, or dashes.

Log in to Workgroup Manager.
Click the Create Workgroup tile, or icon in the upper left-hand corner.
Click the Group name part A drop-down menu. All the stems for which you are a maintainer (including your ~sunetid stem) will be listed. Select your desired stem or submit a Help ticket if you do not see a stem that you think you should have access to.
Enter a unique ID for the Group name part B and a description of the workgroup.
In the Description field, describe the workgroup.
Select how you want your workgroup to be nested or seen and then click Create.

Delete a workgroup

Log in to Workgroup Manager.
Click the My Workgroup tile, or icon in the upper left-hand corner.
Search and select the workgroup name that you want to delete. Use the filtered search to locate the workgroup name quickly.
Click the workgroup Properties tab.
Click the Delete Workgroup button.
Click OK to confirm the deletion.

Note:

Deleting a workgroup is immediate.
The membership of a deleted workgroup is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
Only stem owners can restore the workgroup or its membership once the workgroup is deleted.
Deleted workgroups are marked inactive and retained in the system for future reference.
Once a workgroup is deleted, the name cannot be used to create a new workgroup."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Restrict Access to Webpages Using Workgroups,"Protecting websites with Shibboleth (mod_shib)
If your web server uses Shibboleth (mod_shib) for authentication, you can restrict resources to individuals in specific workgroups by using a special file called .htaccess.

Using a text editor, create a plain text file named .htaccess (note the dot before the name).
Enter the following lines in the file:
AuthType shibboleth
ShibRequestSetting requireSession true
Require shib-attr entitlement helpdesk:consultants helpdesk:managers

If you are hosting on web.stanford.edu, see below for instructions on how to protect your website with WebAuth. 
Transfer the file to the directory you want protected (using Fetch, Dreamweaver or any other file-transfer method).
When anyone attempts to access the directory containing this .htaccess file, they'll be asked to login via Weblogin. Only members of the workgroup you have entered in the .htaccess file will be given access to the directory.

Protecting websites with WebAuth
If your web server uses WebAuth for authentication, you can restrict resources to individuals in specific workgroups by using a special file called .htaccess. Note: WebAuth is deprecated, but is currently the only supported way to restrict access on the central web servers (i.e. web.stanford.edu).

Using a text editor, create a plain text file named .htaccess (note the dot before the name)

Enter the following lines in the file:​
AuthType WebAuth

When anyone attempts to access the directory containing this .htaccess file, they'll be asked to login via Weblogin.
Only members of the workgroup you have entered in the .htaccess file will be given access to the directory.

System-maintained groups
There is a set of system-maintained privgroups and workgroups.
These privgroups can be used in a .htaccess file:

PTS group in AFSCreates a new PTS Group using the existing Stanford workgroup name and membership.
WIN Active DirectoryLinks a workgroup to an Active Directory Authentication group to control access to services.

Once you create the linkage, any membership changes you make within your workgroup also updates in the other service's group. This means that you will only be able to change the membership of the workgroup, and not be able to directly change the membership of the other groups.

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Inactive Workgroup Members,"Inactive members are removed automatically
Workgroup Manager will automatically remove inactive members from a workgroup. Members are inactive when they leave Stanford and no longer have an active SUNet ID.
After members have been inactive for 72 hours, they are automatically removed from all workgroups to which they belong.
Exceptions

Inactive members are not removed from training workgroups.
If the last administrator for a workgroup becomes inactive, they will be removed. The workgroup will continue to exist without administrators. There will no impact to the active members of the workgroup.
If the inactive member is the only administrator of a group off a personal stem (e.g., ~jdoe), no action is taken.  The inactive member remains the administrator on the personal stem."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Nest Workgroups in Workgroup Manager,"Workgroup Manager allows you to nest groups in other groups, which lets you avoid duplication of effort and helps ensure consistency and accuracy in your groups. Nesting looks like this:

uit:webcreators

(i) icon John Smith
(i) icon Jane Doe
(i) icon uit:documentation
(i) icon
(i) icon sulair:dreamweaver-users



In this (hypothetical) example, University IT has created a workgroup within its stem, called ""uit:webcreators,"" to include people whose work involves designing and creating websites.

Three groups have been nested within the uit:webcreators workgroup — these are workgroups belonging to UIT and other organizations, whose membership is directly related to the purpose of this workgroup.
Two individual members, John Smith and Jane Doe, are in organizations that don't have a web workgroup, so they have been added directly to uit:webcreators.

How does nesting help?

The owner of uit:webcreators only had to include five members — two direct members and three nested groups — though the actual membership of the workgroup consists of the combined memberships.
When a new employee joins the web team in the Office of University Communications, her manager adds her to the ouc:website workgroup, and she automatically becomes a member of uit:webcreators.
Only the individual members who don't belong to an appropriate sub-group are added directly to the larger workgroup. This makes it easier to see which members are exceptions.

Workgroups with nested subgroups will be listed slightly differently in your Workgroup Manager home page list of groups. The Number of Members column will display the number of direct members, with an asterisk to indicate there are nested groups whose membership is not included in the count. To see the total number of members in the workgroup, click the (i) icon (in the first column) to see the membership details.
Nest a workgroup
To nest a workgroup: 

Log in to Workgroup Manager.
Click the My Workgroup tile, or icon in the upper left-hand corner.
Search and select the workgroup that you would like to add the nested group to. (You must be an administrator of a workgroup to add a nested group.). Use the filtered search to locate the workgroup name quickly.
Click the Actions button.
Click Nest a Workgroup. 
Search for the group that you would like to nest.
Once the workgroup populates, check the checkbox next to it and click Nest a Workgroup."

Restrictions



Nesting controls whether your workgroup can be included (nested) in the membership or administrators of any other workgroup, or only workgroups with the same stem as yours. If you restrict nesting after a workgroup has been nested in another workgroup, the existing nesting relationship will not change. If you want the workgroup to be removed from any umbrella workgroups, contact the owners of those workgroups. The workgroups in which your group is nested are listed on the Properties tab.
Visibility controls whether or not your workgroup will appear in search results for Workgroup Manager users who are not administrators of your workgroup.
Membership filter: Set conditions for membership in your workgroup. There are three filter options:

No filter: Anyone can be a member of your workgroup, even after they leave Stanford.
Stanford academic & administrative communities: People in your workgroup must have an active affiliation with Stanford. People who no longer meet this requirement will be filtered out.
Specific affiliation (students, faculty, and/or staff): Select one or more of these affiliations. Selecting all three results in a more restricted set than option 2. 





Members who are filtered out of your workgroup still appear on the Members tab in Workgroup Manager but are not counted in its membership and don't have any of the privileges associated with membership in the group. You can click the (i) icon next to the member's name to see the reason the person is filtered out."

"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",Some Third-Party Web Sites Do Not Work Without a Stanford Email Address,"What is the problem?
Many third party services assume that everyone with a SUNetID has a Stanford email address.  That is not always true; many sponsored SUNetIDs do not come with Stanford email service, and some SUNetIDs keep their email address private.  These users may face problems authenticating to certain third-party web sites.
This problem affects you if…

You are trying to access a third-party web site;
When logging in to the third-party web site, you were sent through login.stanford.edu; and
After going through login.stanford.edu, you got an email address-related error.

How do I fix it?
If you have a Stanford email address, you can fix the problem by changing the visibility level of your email address.  If you do not have a Stanford email address, you can fix the problem by providing a third-party email address.
The procedure for both fixes is the same: 

Begin by logging in to StanfordYou [link will open in a new window].
Once logged in, click Maintain your directory and AlertSU emergency contact information.
In the SU Contact Info section, click change…
You will now be at a page where you can change your published email address.
There are two settings to check:

Either select a Stanford email address, or enter a third-party email address.
Set your Email visibility to either 'Public' or 'Stanford'.


Finally, save your changes.

What happens next?
Once your email address has been entered, the change will propagate the Stanford Directory service (LDAP).  The next time you log in to a third-party web site using Stanford credentials, your email address will be provided to the third-party.
It can take up to an hour for your change to propagate.  If an hour has passed and you are still facing issues, first try clearing your browser cache (or logging in using a different browser).  If that still does not solve the issue, then submit a help ticket."
"SUNet IDs, Access, & Sponsorship",How to Grant Authority,"These instructions reflect a new interface and features that will appear in Authority Manager starting June 21, 2021.




Authority Manager lets you grant systems authority to persons whose job requires them to access Stanford business systems.  You grant a privilege to an eligible person and set scope, limits, and conditions on the privilege. A privilege is a specific task or set of tasks that can be granted to an individual. The result is recorded as an assignment. Certain privileges have prerequisites (such as training) that the recipient must complete before the assignment can take effect.
You are allowed to grant only the authority that has been granted to you with the ""can grant"" or ""can only grant"" condition. You can view the authority for which you have grantable access in the authority-granting wizard by clicking the My Authority tile on the Authority Manager homepage. Only individuals in the Stanford administrative and academic communities can receive authority.
When you grant a privilege, you can opt to have it start immediately or set a future start date to activate the authority later.
Grant privileges for which you have grantable access

On the Authority Manager homepage, click the Grant Authority tile or the Grant Authority icon on the left menu to launch the Grant Authority Wizard. Populate the information as described in steps 2 through 8 below.


Enter the SUNet ID (preferred) or name of the person to be granted authority in the Select the person to be granted authority field. The search results will include only members of the Stanford academic and administrative communities — that is, people who are eligible to hold authority.
Select the privilege you want to grant. Click the more info icon to see what privileges are included in the business function, prerequisites, and other related privileges.​Note: The list that appears will only include the privileges you have access to grant.
Select the organization and the scope.
a. Org scope may be different from the organization for which the person works.
b. Select the lowest-level organization required to support the tasks the person will be doing.
c. The wizard automatically lists all the active organizations for which you can grant authority.
d. In the results list, organizations that meet your search criteria, but for which you do not have granting authority, are not linked.

Select a value for limits, if applicable.
a. If there are no limits for this privilege, the limits step will be skipped.
b. If there is one limit, you must select or enter a value for the limit (detailed constraints on the person's authority, such as a spending limit, a project, an admit center, and so on).
c. If there are several limits, each limit will be displayed in turn and you must select or enter a value for each one.

Select conditions for this privilege, such as whether it can be granted forward. (Scroll down the page to the ""Authority Conditions"" section to read more about authority conditions.)
Indicate an effective start date. Start dates can be set for a future date if you want to activate the authority later. If desired, set an override expiration date.Note: Unless you set an expiration date, all privileges remain in place until they are revoked or until the person leaves Stanford. There may be situations where you want to set an employee an expiration date override for when a privilege should terminate. For example, you may wish to assign privileges to someone for three months while a co-worker is out on leave. In the majority of cases, you will not want to set a date. 
Add optional comments and click Grant Authority to save.​
You will see a confirmation that the assignment is complete and if there are prerequisites that must be completed. The person you have granted authority to will receive an email notification about this authority, including information on any incomplete prerequisites. Click Grant Another if you are not finished. Once the prerequisites (if there are any) are satisfied, all authority grants take effect within one business day.


Learn more about granting authority
Understand Authority Conditions
Assignments scoped to a PI cannot be made grantable. Can ONLY grant is not available for all privileges.
Cannot grant: this person will have the authority to do the tasks associated with the granted privilege, but cannot grant this authority to anyone else
CAN grant: this person will have the authority to do the tasks associated with the granted privilege, and can grant the same authority to others

This will take you back to the granting-authority wizard. Click the  Request dropdown arrow and select the appropriate action.
Organization hierarchy
It's important to understand how the University Org Chart works when granting authority. Every employee at Stanford works for a particular organization, and every financial account is associated with a particular organization. These organizations are designated by a four-letter code in the administrative systems. A person may have authority over any organization, and granting authority at a parent level org also grants authority to any child orgs under that parent level organization. For example, granting authority to someone using the Hoover Institution org code (AGBS), also grants them authority over Hoover Institution Operations (AGFO), Program Development (AGNG), Resource Development (AGUY), Operations (AHCQ), Research (AHKI), and Hoover Library/Archives (AHSA).
You can also grant authority at higher or lower levels on the org tree to include more or less access accordingly. For example, you could grant authority to just the Hoover Library/Archives (AHSA), limiting the grant to that child org only, or you could grant authority at the President's Office (AAAA), which grants authority over all of the Hoover Institute orgs, and all of the other orgs that report to the President's Office.
There are some privileges that do not require or allow specific organization scope. These privileges default the organization's scope to Stanford University (AA00) upon selection."

Once created, these authorization groups can be used by services that authenticate via Active Directory (AD).
For a new Active Directory group linkage you must accept the default name offered and not change it. The default name is the name of your workgroup. However, an Active Directory group name cannot contain colons (:) so these are replaced with hyphens (-). For example, the default name for the mais:website-editor workgroup is mais-website-editor. If an Active Directory group already exists, the linking will simply be established with the existing group.

Computers & Laptops,Use an iMac as a Display with Target Display Mode,"Target Display Mode lets you use the built-in display on a supported iMac as an external display for another Mac.

To use your iMac as a display in Target Display Mode, connect it to another Mac using the correct cable (see System Requirements below). Then press Command-F2 on the keyboard connected to your iMac. When you're done, press Command-F2 again.
System Requirements
Enter Target Display Mode
Exit Target Display Mode
Display Options
System Requirements
You need the following to use Target Display Mode:

A Mac notebook or desktop with a Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt port. If your Mac has Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, you can connect it using the Apple Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) to Thunderbolt 2 Adapter.
A Thunderbolt cable or a Mini DisplayPort to Mini DisplayPort cable  
A supported iMac with OS X v10.6.1 or later

See the list below for iMac models that support Target Display Mode, the type of cable you need to connect that model of iMac, and the kind of port you need on your other Mac.



iMac models you can use as a display
Cable you need
Port you need on your other Mac

iMac (Mid 2011-Mid 2014)
Thunderbolt
Thunderbolt



iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014) and later iMac models can't be used as Target Display Mode displays.

Use Target Display Mode
Follow these steps to start using your iMac as a display:

Make sure that your iMac is turned on, and the other Mac is logged in to a macOS user account.
Connect the Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable between the two computers.
Press Command-F2 on the keyboard of the iMac that you want to use as a display.

After you press Command-F2, your iMac displays the desktop from the connected Mac.

If Command-F2 doesn't work
If your iMac doesn't switch to Target Display Mode when you press Command-F2, check these things:

Make sure that the iMac you're trying to use as a display supports Target Display Mode. 
Target Display Mode works only when your primary Mac is logged in to a macOS user account. For example, if your first Mac is at the FileVault login screen, pressing Command-F2 on your iMac does not enable Target Display Mode. You must first log in to your Mac (using a regular display, if necessary) before you can use an iMac in Target Display Mode.
Make sure that you're pressing Command-F2 on the keyboard that's connected to the iMac you want to use as a display.
In Keyboard System Preferences, if the checkbox is enabled for ""Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys,"" the key combination changes to Command-Fn-F2.
Make sure that your Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt cable is connected to both computers.
If you're currently logged in on the iMac you want to use as a display, try logging out to return to the login window. Then press Command-F2 again.
Some older Apple keyboards and third-party keyboards might not allow Command-F2 to toggle display modes. If this happens, use the keyboard that came with your iMac to toggle Target Display Mode on and off. 
If your iMac is currently started up in Windows, it won't enter Target Display Mode. Target Display Mode isn't supported in Boot Camp.


Exit Target Display Mode
To leave Target Display Mode, press Command-F2 on the iMac keyboard again. Your iMac also exits Target Display Mode if you disconnect the cable that connects the two computers, or if you shut down or sleep either computer.
If the connected Mac goes into sleep mode, the iMac screen turns off until you wake the other computer, or until you take your iMac out of Target Display Mode.

Display options
You can control the brightness of your iMac display while it's in Target Display Mode from a connected Mac. Use the Displays pane of System Preferences on the connected Mac, or use the brightness keys on the keyboard of the connected Mac.
To hear audio from a connected Mac using the built-in speakers of your iMac, select the iMac from the Sound pane of System Preferences. You can also use the sound and media keys on the keyboard of the connected Mac to adjust volume and control playback of iTunes and other media.
Connect more than one display
You can use multiple iMac computers as displays as long as each iMac is directly connected to a Thunderbolt port on your computer using a ThunderBolt cable. Each iMac you connect as a display counts towards the maximum number of simultaneously connected displays that your Mac supports.
Avoid trying to connect (chain) iMac computers that are in Target Display Mode to each other. Each iMac in Target Display Mode should be connected directly to a Mini DisplayPort or ThunderBolt port directly on the Mac where you want to use it as a display.
Use apps on your iMac
Any apps that are open on your iMac remain open and active while your iMac is in Target Display Mode. For example, if you begin playing music in iTunes on your iMac and then activate Target Display Mode, iTunes doesn't pause on your iMac.
If you've set your iMac to automatically log out, apps are paused or closed when this happens but your iMac remains in Target Display Mode.
Connect devices to your Mac
A Mac that's connected to an iMac in Target Display Mode can't use the iMac computer's built-in camera, its USB, ThunderBolt, or FireWire ports, or devices connected to those ports. To use external devices with your Mac, connect these devices directly to the Mac that you want to use them with.

Recommended Best Practices for Computer Maintenance
RESTART ONCE A WEEK
All laptops, desktops, iPads, or phones should be restarted at least once a week to allow updates, clean the cache, and keep systems running at their best. A slow-running computer, in many cases, is a clear indication that memory is limited and needs to be released. A simple restart refreshes all the system memory registers, making them ready to start over again. If your computer is being restarted on a more consistent basis, it will keep it running optimally over time.
Update your location information in Stanford You  https://stanfordyou.stanford.edu
PERFORM SYSTEM UPDATES REGULARLY
Whenever you are prompted to run the Windows update on PCs or the system updates on Mac devices, please run them as soon as possible.  These can be run at lunchtime or before you leave for the day to enable them to complete.  DO NOT turn off machines while making updates, as that can greatly affect your system.  There will be a reboot required once the updates are complete.  If run regularly, it should not take more than a few minutes each time. 
For Apple devices:  Click the Apple in the top left corner of the Mac Menu Bar, click System Settings, then Software update.
For Dell devices:  Type windows update in the search field on the toolbar, select Update
** NOTE: For complete operating system releases, please wait until the first updated version comes out prior to running **
BACK UP MACHINES WITH CRASHPLAN
Crashplan (CP) is Stanford’s backup utility to create a secure encrypted backup of locally stored data from your machine to the secure cloud.  All Stanford assets should have the application installed and associated with the primary owner's Sunet ID.  Please validate that CrashPlan is running by clicking the Folder icon in the Mac Menu Bar, opening the application with your Sunet information, and running the backups.  If you do not have CrashPlan, you can request support via TDSHelp.stanford.edu, or call the TDS Service Desk for assistance. 
 
ADDING OR REMOVING DEVICES
Any time you receive a new machine, pad, or phone, or are planning to surplus an old device, please make the updates in:
https://mydevices.stanford.edu   Register new or remove previously registered desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones used for Stanford work and/or accessing the Stanford network.  https://amie.stanford.edu   Update your attestation, ensuring that each device found in MyDevices has also been attested for high-risk data to avoid security compliance audit discrepancies that can lead to your Sunet being disabled. 
DISPOSING STANFORD ASSETS
Disposal/eRecycling of electronic devices is handled by Surplus Sales with the Office of Research Administration
https://ora.stanford.edu/ora-units/property-management-office/surplus-property-sales/surplus-property-disposals
TDS does not need to be involved in the disposal of assets between departments and Surplus Sales. We can assist in re-imaging machines AFTER they are sold back to individuals or departments via Surplus Sales.
*** NOTE: Apple systems, make sure to log out of your Apple account and turn off Find My Device tracking so the machine can be resold or disposed of.
Turn off Find My on your devices and items - Apple Support
 USING PERSONAL MACHINES / MACHINE LIFESPAN
Using personal machines for Stanford work should be very limited.   Field Support is not able to work on personal devices other than to help make the machine compliant.  If Personally owned devices have hardware issues, the customer will be required to take care of those repairs on their own.  We recommend the departments provide Stanford-owned devices for their staff/ faculty, especially when accessing high-risk data
We recommend that Stanford-owned machines be replaced at least every 5 years for best performance. Current hardware warranties expire after 3 years."

Computers & Laptops,How to Gain Access to the Network from a New SoM Device,"The primary method for gaining network access is by our Self Registration service. This process can be used by most computers, Apple mobile devices (e.g. iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad), and Androids.
What Is Self Registration?
Stanford Network Self Registration (SNSR) is a service that allows anyone with a SUNet ID to register their computer or mobile device's network connections with the School of Medicine. Simply plugging in to any network jack in the School of Medicine or connecting to the ""Stanford"" wireless network and then opening a web browser will direct you to the self registration page. The process will then register all wireless and wired network cards (if applicable) for use on the School of Medicine network. This is compatible with Windows as well as Mac OS X. This process is not compatible with Linux.
Process For Self Registration

Your device must be set for DHCP (which obtains an IP address automatically). This is the default setup for most devices.
Plug in your computer's Ethernet port into any School of Medicine network jack. This will give your computer an IP address of 10.65.x.x which will allow you to self register. To use self registration over the wireless network, connect to the ""Stanford"" wireless network. This will give your computer or mobile device an IP address of 10.22.x.x.
Open a web browser and follow the online instructions.
The self registration utility will ensure certain requirements are met, and fix them and install software if necessary.
When the process completes, your computer or mobile device should be registered within 30 minutes. If it is not working then, you may try rebooting your device.
If your device is not working after that, please call the IRT Service Desk at (650) 725-8000.

To learn more, see Gaining Access to the Network."
